I<00:03:31.210> guess<00:03:32.210> because<00:03:33.790> Nintendo<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.850> America<00:03:35.210> had

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
I guess because Nintendo of America had

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.230 
I guess because Nintendo of America had
a<00:03:35.360> problem<00:03:35.600> with<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.990> beating<00:03:36.260> up<00:03:36.350> women<00:03:36.530> I

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
a problem with you beating up women I

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.890 
a problem with you beating up women I
don't<00:03:38.240> know<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.820> then<00:03:41.300> they<00:03:41.450> also<00:03:41.570> took<00:03:41.720> out

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
don't know and then they also took out

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.060 
don't know and then they also took out
the<00:03:42.020> little<00:03:42.170> spurts<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.530> blood<00:03:42.710> when<00:03:42.890> they'd

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
the little spurts of blood when they'd

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.360

whatever<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.170> want<00:04:24.350> but

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.900 

I<00:04:30.070> was<00:04:31.070> my<00:04:31.250> training<00:04:31.520> for<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:33.520> was<00:04:34.520> looking<00:04:34.730> at

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
I was my training for I was looking at

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.040 
I was my training for I was looking at
the<00:04:34.970> systems<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.450> heard<00:04:35.630> really<00:04:35.840> good<00:04:35.990> things

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the systems I heard really good things

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.720 
the systems I heard really good things
and<00:04:36.910> then<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.060> found<00:04:38.300> out<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.660> does<00:04:38.870> play

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
and then I found out that it does play

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.940 
and then I found out that it does play
import<00:04:40.730> games<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.350> obviously<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.440> does

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
import games and obviously it does

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.030 
import games and obviously it does
you<00:04:43.730> saw<00:04:44.270> proof<00:04:44.570> positive<00:04:44.750> right<00:04:45.140> here<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:46.420> I

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
you saw proof positive right here and I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.840 
you saw proof positive right here and I
just<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:50.440> had<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.560> get<00:04:51.740> it<00:04:51.860> it's<00:04:52.250> totally<00:04:52.670> worth

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
system worth getting and you see the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.440 
system worth getting and you see the
picture<00:04:57.890> quality<00:04:58.310> is<00:04:58.460> really<00:04:58.850> good<00:04:58.940> it's<00:04:59.540> the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
picture quality is really good it's the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.370 
picture quality is really good it's the
sound<00:05:02.450> for<00:05:02.600> super<00:05:02.810> there<00:05:03.050> could<00:05:03.170> be<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.260> little

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
sound for super there could be a little

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.070 
sound for super there could be a little
better<00:05:03.620> but<00:05:04.960> what<00:05:05.960> did<00:05:06.050> what<00:05:06.140> you<00:05:06.200> could<00:05:06.350> do<00:05:08.080> it

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
better but what did what you could do it

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.210 
better but what did what you could do it
maybe<00:05:09.170> better<00:05:09.440> on<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:09.680> video<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:09.980> haven't

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220
