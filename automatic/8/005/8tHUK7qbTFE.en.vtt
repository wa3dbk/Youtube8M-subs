00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.790
 good eches 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.119
 if it is a very hard result for the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
 equipment that will do that it can be done in 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.340
 which are the failures that the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.440
 team in this match 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.500
 is not that the 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.910
 the anger and the anger that we all have 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 have happened again in a series of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.970
 of mistakes we made in the last 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.970
 match 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 what bothers me is both the two 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.660
 faces of a tree and a face in zorrilla 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.699
 and another face away from home that we are in 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.030
 the last exits as well the 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.530
 team that we are competing as 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.820
 we must compete in precision and 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.440
 especially 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.780
 with what we are playing right now 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.880
 we are in the critical and good situation 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.650
 we have to be aware that the 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.060
 matches at 20 minutes you can not go 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.100
 20 divisions or the most grenade rival 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.590
 that they too today faced 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.670
 good match with an intensity like 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.290
 as it has been proven and we have been 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 overcome there is 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.190
 we look at the navel we have very clear 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.140
 doors for inside wardrobe what 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.110
 we have to do well not to commit 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.170
 number of errors that we are 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.760
 repeatedly committing this ends the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.110
 first round and if there is no miracle 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.330
 Tomorrow the balance speaks of Celtic ' 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.800
 the dance will end in decline and the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.190
 true that this looks very bad with 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.690
 the image that I give the team yes and the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.810
 silence 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.950
 for my part it would be the best answer me 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 I think the players themselves are 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 conscious at rest 80 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.590
 we will correct good and still in the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.509
 second part we had fitted two 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.440
 more goals we can live up to and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.270
 I think with the amount of interest and 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.310
 of things that we're playing as a club 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 as professionals that we are today 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.670
 honestly the criticism is small 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.250
 because we ourselves know 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.910
 perfectly that we can not compete the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.910
 way we have done 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.060
 in the middle of the field there has been a 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.280
 change in the rest or it will be that it has 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.170
 wrong lining up from rossi home 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.420
 of víctor pérez because the grenade has 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.080
 superiority or is satisfied with the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.000
 initial address 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.500
 from 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.150
 many of the results can be drawn 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.740
 conclusions and or the team that pulled 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.240
 initially it is the team that has 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.100
 repeated at that time if it's going to start 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.470
 the party right now would have put 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.270
 the 11 in changed two players in that 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.730
 rest but not with the intention of pointing 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.930
 nobody have we put fixed theologian the bad 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.240
 lucky that I did well we have grown 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.600
 the senates everywhere you take year and 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.590
 then you already have and changed the few 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.610
 occasions that we may have had 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.830
 because there have been moments that also 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.209
 but less the party for less and 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.770
 try to get the team to take a bit of 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.820
 self-esteem at all times good not what 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.110
 we have deserved 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.850
 that's why the punishment as well comments 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.959
 acts without a blunt 4-0 in which 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.790
 puts a repair you have to face the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.420
 grenade that has been superior and has played 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.420
 much better than us 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.350
 you see solutions like this in the short term already 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 it's a little bit the repeat a little each 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.190
 Sunday the same as you know what 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.950
 fails but of course they do not arrive 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.400
 corrections a solution I think that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.350
 We will do all is the team 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.150
 coaching staff we have clear things 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.860
 so he said saying we can 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.110
 exceed 2 faces when we compete as 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.460
 local when we compete away from home the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.990
 team has to be forceful the 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.000
 equipment has to have few fissures 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.270
 defensive has to be that point of 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.470
 aggressiveness in the defensive aspect that 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.690
 does not mean mind the block 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.620
 defensive the whole team and know 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.210
 really that we are playing 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.640
 many things and that no forecast 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.240
 I forgive you prison any mistake is 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.290
 strong and it has been 40 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.700
 mark what has happened from the field 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.700
 good night and thank you very much
