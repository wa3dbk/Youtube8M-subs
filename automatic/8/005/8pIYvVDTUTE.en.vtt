what's<00:00:28.410> interesting<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.039> note<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
what's interesting to note is that it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.680 
what's interesting to note is that it
uses<00:00:30.179> 10<00:00:30.840> millimeter<00:00:32.960> drivers<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.690> basic

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
uses 10 millimeter drivers so basic

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.060 
uses 10 millimeter drivers so basic
packaging<00:00:37.079> nothing<00:00:37.530> fancy<00:00:39.770> moving<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
packaging nothing fancy moving on to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
packaging nothing fancy moving on to
what's<00:00:41.399> inside<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> try<00:00:43.469> flanks<00:00:44.420> by

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
what's inside you get a try flanks by

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.830 
what's inside you get a try flanks by
flanks<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:47.160> large<00:00:49.070> medium<00:00:50.180> medium<00:00:51.180> small<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
flanks a large medium medium small and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.279 
flanks a large medium medium small and
really<00:00:52.140> tiny<00:00:52.440> ones<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.420> same<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.960> any

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
really tiny ones so the same with any

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.389 
really tiny ones so the same with any
other<00:00:55.530> official<00:00:56.039> audio<00:00:56.129> uh<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:57.980> am<00:00:58.980> since<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
other official audio uh I am since that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.450 
other official audio uh I am since that
it<00:00:59.670> actually<00:00:59.940> has<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.480> cloth<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.530> felt<00:01:02.070> cloth

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it actually has this cloth or felt cloth

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.350 
it actually has this cloth or felt cloth
back<00:01:02.969> pull<00:01:03.420> string<00:01:03.629> ones<00:01:04.040> normal<00:01:05.360> inside

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
back pull string ones normal inside

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.390 
back pull string ones normal inside
another<00:01:07.400> manual<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:09.180> should<00:01:09.330> only<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.570> anyway

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
another manual we should only be anyway

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.990 
another manual we should only be anyway
so<00:01:11.479> that's<00:01:12.479> why<00:01:12.630> i<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.110> inside<00:01:13.880> moving<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so that's why i get for inside moving on

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080 
so that's why i get for inside moving on
to<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> IM<00:01:15.750> itself<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.820> interesting

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to the IM itself so the interesting

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
to the IM itself so the interesting
thing<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.470> i<00:01:19.500> am<00:01:19.799> itself<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
thing about the i am itself with the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
thing about the i am itself with the
design<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.270> people<00:01:21.540> say<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.990> looks

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
design some people say that it looks

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.390 
design some people say that it looks
like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> klipsch<00:01:22.590> s4i<00:01:23.119> majoo<00:01:24.950> s55<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.280> not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like a klipsch s4i majoo s55 are not

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.179 
like a klipsch s4i majoo s55 are not
sure<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.930> actually<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.320> bit<00:01:28.650> different

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
sure but it's actually a bit different

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
sure but it's actually a bit different
if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> notice<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.770> slight

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
if you notice that's actually a slight

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
if you notice that's actually a slight
groove<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:35.369> doesn't<00:01:35.729> feel<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
groove here and it doesn't feel like a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.190 
groove here and it doesn't feel like a
s5<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:38.180> same<00:01:39.180> same<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.659> different<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
s5 actually same same but different you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.870 
s5 actually same same but different you
know<00:01:40.320> i<00:01:40.350> mean<00:01:41.150> that<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.630> use<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:42.960> cloth

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
know i mean that they use the same cloth

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.300 
know i mean that they use the same cloth
sleeve<00:01:45.320> same<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> genesis<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.540> normal

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
sleeve same like the genesis the normal

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.719 
sleeve same like the genesis the normal
plastic<00:01:50.310> y<00:01:51.060> splitter<00:01:51.560> holder<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
plastic y splitter holder and the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.120 
plastic y splitter holder and the
stopper<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.570> same<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:56.780> for<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.200> 45<00:01:59.009> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
stopper is here same thing for the 45 to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.209 
stopper is here same thing for the 45 to
60<00:01:59.490> degrees<00:01:59.670> angle<00:02:00.180> Jack<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.680> complete<00:02:02.040> it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
60 degrees angle Jack and complete it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
60 degrees angle Jack and complete it
and<00:02:03.259> about<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.229> pressure

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and about it so this is the pressure

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
and about it so this is the pressure
