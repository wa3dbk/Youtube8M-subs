of<00:00:49.710> her<00:00:49.890> um<00:00:51.590> darkness<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.620> cover<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
of her um darkness will cover the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.119 
of her um darkness will cover the
horizon<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> Templars<00:00:54.960> according<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
horizon to the Templars according to the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
horizon to the Templars according to the
Templars<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.850> horizon<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.270> world<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
Templars the horizon is the the world I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.189 
Templars the horizon is the the world I
don't<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.180> that'd<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
don't think I don't think that'd be that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.609 
don't think I don't think that'd be that
that<00:01:04.920> loose<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> Lucy<00:01:06.619> that

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that loose that because of Lucy that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
that loose that because of Lucy that
will<00:01:07.740> happen<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.189> she<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.430> an<00:01:08.549> assassin<00:01:09.060> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
will happen if she was an assassin so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
will happen if she was an assassin so
that<00:01:09.360> probably<00:01:09.720> means<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:10.470> she<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that probably means as she is a a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.859 
that probably means as she is a a
Templar<00:01:12.330> um<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:14.420> Minerva<00:01:15.420> could<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
Templar um and Minerva could be a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.340 
Templar um and Minerva could be a
Templar<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.970> she<00:01:17.970> use<00:01:18.420> an<00:01:18.600> apple<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Templar because she use an apple to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.880 
Templar because she use an apple to
control<00:01:19.740> people<00:01:20.750> which<00:01:21.750> only<00:01:21.990> Templars<00:01:22.650> can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
control people which only Templars can

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
control people which only Templars can
do<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.310> assassin<00:01:23.729> 32<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.270> watching<00:01:24.659> ER<00:01:24.960> trip

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
do in assassin 32 you watching ER trip

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
do in assassin 32 you watching ER trip
video<00:01:26.100> um<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:28.250> also<00:01:29.250> she<00:01:29.280> couldn't<00:01:30.000> because

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
video um and also she couldn't because

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.109 
video um and also she couldn't because
she<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.750> Lucy<00:01:31.470> wasn't<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.950> Templar<00:01:32.430> she<00:01:32.670> she

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
she if Lucy wasn't a Templar she she

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.460 
she if Lucy wasn't a Templar she she
would<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> template<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.369> she<00:01:35.369> forced

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
would be a template because she forced

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
would be a template because she forced
Desmond<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> Apple<00:01:38.250> um<00:01:40.909> she<00:01:41.909> falls

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
Desmond of the Apple um she falls

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.840 
Desmond of the Apple um she falls
Desmond<00:01:42.829> she<00:01:43.829> used<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> Apple<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> force

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
Desmond she used the Apple to force

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.469 
Desmond she used the Apple to force
Desmond<00:01:45.329> establish<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.299> she<00:01:48.299> said

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
Desmond establish a and she said

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
Desmond establish a and she said
something<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.930> she<00:01:49.200> stabbed<00:01:49.470> news<00:01:49.680> because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
something about she stabbed news because

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.219 
something about she stabbed news because
Lucy<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:50.970> something<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> stuffed<00:01:52.049> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Lucy was doing something that stuffed up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.600 
Lucy was doing something that stuffed up
the<00:01:52.530> future<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.850> probably<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the future which probably was the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
the future which probably was the
temperatures<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.630> Templar<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.009> assassin

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
temperatures a Templar and the assassin

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.600 
temperatures a Templar and the assassin
and<00:01:59.640> maybe<00:01:59.790> something<00:02:00.090> wrong<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.579> this<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and maybe something wrong so this is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
and maybe something wrong so this is
just<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.570> believe<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.229> Lucy<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
just what I think I believe that Lucy is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.570 
just what I think I believe that Lucy is
more<00:02:05.579> likely<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.090> Templar<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
more likely the Templar but if you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.240 
more likely the Templar but if you
