certainly<00:00:54.429> not<00:00:55.209> like<00:00:55.449> general<00:00:55.690> Skywalker<00:00:56.429> but

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429

I have my way it may be difficult but

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.389 
I have my way it may be difficult but
these<00:01:01.149> are<00:01:01.209> difficult<00:01:01.449> times<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.859> that's

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
these are difficult times and that's

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.280 
these are difficult times and that's
kind<00:01:03.729> of<00:01:03.789> what<00:01:03.940> I'm<00:01:04.059> bar<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.449> about<00:01:04.750> nothing

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290

Skywalker<00:01:15.520> it's<00:01:15.790> different<00:01:16.270> for<00:01:16.450> them<00:01:16.630> and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
Skywalker it's different for them and

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.540 
Skywalker it's different for them and
what<00:01:16.900> does<00:01:17.020> he<00:01:17.200> think<00:01:17.230> of<00:01:17.500> clones<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.130> make

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
what does he think of clones and make

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.800 
what does he think of clones and make
some<00:01:18.730> question<00:01:19.150> what<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.450> means<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.720> be

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
some question what it means to be

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.210 
some question what it means to be
soldiers<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.500> think<00:01:20.710> that's<00:01:20.860> kind<00:01:21.040> of<00:01:21.070> at

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
soldiers and I think that's kind of at

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.070 
soldiers and I think that's kind of at
the<00:01:21.310> heart<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.550> this<00:01:21.670> whole<00:01:21.880> thing<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.570> why

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
the heart of this whole thing so why

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.450 
the heart of this whole thing so why
aren't<00:01:23.230> we<00:01:23.290> sticking<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.920> original<00:01:23.950> plan

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
aren't we sticking to the original plan

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.390 
aren't we sticking to the original plan
probing<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> city<00:01:25.420> defenses<00:01:25.660> first<00:01:26.190> we<00:01:27.190> could

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
probing the city defenses first we could

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.660 
probing the city defenses first we could
do<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.880> recording<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.930> embark<00:01:29.620> was<00:01:30.100> the
