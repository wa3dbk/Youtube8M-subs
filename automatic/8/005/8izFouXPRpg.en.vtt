00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.409 
we're mostly active on we use to which a
lot<00:06:48.289> more<00:06:48.469> than<00:06:48.620> YouTube<00:06:49.029> because<00:06:50.029> I<00:06:50.240> find

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
lot more than YouTube because I find

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.779 
lot more than YouTube because I find
streaming<00:06:50.719> so<00:06:51.050> much<00:06:51.199> better<00:06:51.610> and<00:06:52.610> also

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
streaming so much better and also

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.450 
streaming so much better and also
because<00:06:53.029> of<00:06:53.150> my<00:06:53.270> low<00:06:53.800> upload<00:06:54.800> it<00:06:55.039> means<00:06:55.189> I<00:06:55.279> can

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
because of my low upload it means I can

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.360 
because of my low upload it means I can
stream<00:06:55.759> league<00:06:56.539> of<00:06:56.689> legends<00:06:56.990> in<00:06:57.139> HD<00:06:57.560> compared

stream league of legends in HD compared
to<00:06:58.430> this<00:06:58.789> because<00:06:59.060> the<00:06:59.240> background<00:06:59.419> changes

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960
