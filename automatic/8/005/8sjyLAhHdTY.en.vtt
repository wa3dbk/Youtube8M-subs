hi<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.090> Paul<00:00:06.300> for<00:00:06.420> holic<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.290> my

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
hi I'm Paul for holic this is my

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.860 
hi I'm Paul for holic this is my
multi-touch<00:00:07.980> table<00:00:08.299> I'm<00:00:09.299> just<00:00:09.510> standing<00:00:09.750> out

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
multi-touch table I'm just standing out

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.299 
multi-touch table I'm just standing out
of<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.020> frame<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.590> can<00:00:10.740> focus<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
of the frame here so we can focus on the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.009 
of the frame here so we can focus on the
screen<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:12.180> doing<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.420> brief<00:00:12.840> demonstration

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
screen just doing a brief demonstration

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.530 
screen just doing a brief demonstration
of<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.680> calibration<00:00:14.190> system<00:00:14.550> for<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
of the calibration system for the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.929 
of the calibration system for the
bespoke<00:00:15.780> multi-touch<00:00:16.320> framework<00:00:16.770> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.820> can

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
bespoke multi-touch framework if you can

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.019 
bespoke multi-touch framework if you can
see<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.009> points<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.610> calibration

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
see here the the points of calibration

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.769 
see here the the points of calibration
are<00:00:21.660> pretty<00:00:22.380> far<00:00:22.590> off<00:00:22.619> right<00:00:23.009> now<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.599> this<00:00:24.599> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
are pretty far off right now the this is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.409 
are pretty far off right now the this is
going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> vary<00:00:25.320> from<00:00:25.439> point<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.009> point<00:00:26.419> the

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
going to vary from point to point the

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.830 
going to vary from point to point the
camera<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:29.009> not<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.489> line<00:00:29.669> with<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
camera is not in line with with the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.010 
camera is not in line with with the
surface<00:00:31.200> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.940> screen<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.630> exactly

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
surface of the screen which is exactly

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.229 
surface of the screen which is exactly
why<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.590> calibration<00:00:35.160> issue<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
why we have this calibration issue and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
why we have this calibration issue and
then<00:00:36.690> varies<00:00:37.109> from<00:00:37.379> one<00:00:37.590> point<00:00:37.769> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> screen

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
then varies from one point on the screen

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.060 
then varies from one point on the screen
to<00:00:38.489> another<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.449> instead<00:00:40.019> I<00:00:40.500> wrote<00:00:41.039> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to another so instead I wrote a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.720 
to another so instead I wrote a
calibration<00:00:41.519> algorithm<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
calibration algorithm and this

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.430 
calibration algorithm and this
calibration<00:00:45.059> algorithm<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
calibration algorithm can take in and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.439 
calibration algorithm can take in and
the<00:00:47.070> burr<00:00:47.219> points<00:00:47.609> an<00:00:47.699> arbitrary<00:00:48.179> number<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
the burr points an arbitrary number of

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.590 
the burr points an arbitrary number of
points<00:00:49.070> here<00:00:50.070> I've<00:00:50.370> chose<00:00:50.579> 13<00:00:51.269> points<00:00:53.600> trying

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
points here I've chose 13 points trying

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.639 
points here I've chose 13 points trying
to<00:00:54.780> stay<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> frame<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.559> bit

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
to stay out of the frame a little bit

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.630 
to stay out of the frame a little bit
okay<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.429> there's<00:00:59.609> 13<00:00:59.969> points<00:01:01.190> around<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
okay so there's 13 points around the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.610 
okay so there's 13 points around the
screen<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:03.929> it's<00:01:04.110> computing<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
screen now right now it's computing a

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.060 
screen now right now it's computing a
lookup<00:01:05.220> table<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.960> saves<00:01:07.230> that<00:01:07.320> lookup<00:01:07.710> table

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
lookup table it saves that lookup table

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
lookup table it saves that lookup table
off<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.090> next<00:01:09.240> time<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> reload<00:01:10.079> if

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
off so then next time we can reload if

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
off so then next time we can reload if
as<00:01:10.409> long<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.250> camera<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
as long as the the camera in the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
as long as the the camera in the
projector<00:01:13.259> if<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.560> don't<00:01:13.710> change<00:01:14.479> relative

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
projector if they don't change relative

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
projector if they don't change relative
to<00:01:15.509> each<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:15.899> then<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.100> same

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to each other then then the same

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.130 
to each other then then the same
calibration<00:01:17.790> data<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.149> used<00:01:18.360> again<00:01:18.689> all

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
calibration data can be used again all

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.539 
calibration data can be used again all
right<00:01:19.259> I'm<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.829> calibration<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
right I'm with just that calibration of

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.480 
right I'm with just that calibration of
data<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> Tom<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> fly<00:01:23.040> real-time

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
data now on the Tom on the fly real-time

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.520 
data now on the Tom on the fly real-time
you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.329> see<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> calibration<00:01:25.259> points

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can see that the calibration points

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
you can see that the calibration points
now<00:01:25.649> are<00:01:25.740> much<00:01:26.070> much<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.549> accurate<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
now are much much more accurate the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.810 
now are much much more accurate the
points<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> contact<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.770> underlying<00:01:29.460> what's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
points of contact so underlying what's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
points of contact so underlying what's
happening<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.079> I'm

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
happening there is that I'm

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
happening there is that I'm
interpolating<00:01:32.000> in<00:01:33.000> between<00:01:33.479> those<00:01:33.689> different

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
interpolating in between those different

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
interpolating in between those different
points<00:01:34.439> weighting<00:01:35.039> them<00:01:35.159> depending<00:01:35.640> on

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
points weighting them depending on

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.120 
points weighting them depending on
depending<00:01:35.969> on<00:01:36.270> their<00:01:36.390> distance<00:01:36.770> between<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
depending on their distance between the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.649 
depending on their distance between the
the<00:01:38.369> sample<00:01:38.759> point<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> point<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.509> I'm

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the sample point and the point that I'm

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.600 
the sample point and the point that I'm
actually<00:01:39.840> collecting<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.399> I<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
actually collecting now and then I do a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
actually collecting now and then I do a
lookup<00:01:41.939> into<00:01:42.149> this<00:01:42.329> pre-built<00:01:42.810> table<00:01:43.140> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
lookup into this pre-built table so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
lookup into this pre-built table so
what's<00:01:43.920> good<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
what's good about that is that the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.639 
what's good about that is that the
number<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.250> points<00:01:47.250> being<00:01:47.969> arbitrary<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
number of points being arbitrary I can

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
number of points being arbitrary I can
have<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.369> 40<00:01:50.939> points<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.450> calibration

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
have you know 40 points of calibration

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.529 
have you know 40 points of calibration
and<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.159> cost<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:53.789> still<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.149> fixed<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
and the cost would still be fixed it

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:55.819 
and the cost would still be fixed it
would<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.750> take<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> little<00:01:55.320> bit<00:01:55.439> longer<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
would be take a little bit longer to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
would be take a little bit longer to
generate<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.280> table<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.729> once<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> actual

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
generate the table but once the actual

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289 
generate the table but once the actual
lookup<00:01:57.719> table<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.140> created<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.759> it's<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
lookup table is created then it's a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.149 
lookup table is created then it's a
fixed<00:02:00.570> cost<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.990> Ashley<00:02:01.350> look<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.679> values<00:02:01.979> up

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
fixed cost to Ashley look the values up

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.590 
fixed cost to Ashley look the values up
and<00:02:02.520> they<00:02:02.640> would<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.240> accurate

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and they would just get more accurate

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
and they would just get more accurate
with<00:02:03.689> more<00:02:03.929> points<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
with more points and that's the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.939 
with more points and that's the
calibration<00:02:05.820> system
