00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello my name is elias long and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.719
 today we are testing the new samsung galaxy 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.320
 s 4 active on watertightness in the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.670
 internet is written on the phone 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 not waterproof 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.100
 although the manufacturer samsung indicates that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 up to a meter deep 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 we want the waterproofness therefore 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.689
 Today it's time to test if this is really the case 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.439
 and whether the rumors on the internet was are 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 everything seems to work to me like 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 You see, I'll be right in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 Let's do some music 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 let's see if that via a bluetooth 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.460
 Speaker works as well 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.520
 music now 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 and then 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.129
 Let's just grab the phone 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.970
 Once in the water that's what's going on 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:03.290
 I also can listen to music 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.290
 do not talk here 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.930
 they only come it still works 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:18.090
 everything so I can say first 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:22.970
 the phone is waterproof so that times 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.970
 out getting any more functions of 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 make up 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.829
 with penn also times to see how far 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.649
 the water actually enters mine 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:49.649
 phone because you have to be careful that you 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:52.539
 at these corners counterclockwise presses good 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.819
 and especially important here is just 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.819
 with as already say that a man gives 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.319
 probably try relative 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.079
 Be careful, especially as you maybe too 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.399
 can see where to where 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.399
 just the water comes 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.160
 you can see it already 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.560
 here are some drops of water 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.200
 and he's sort of where they are 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.050
 school , there we have some here 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.800
 everything is dry then goes down 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.400
 here we have water drops again 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.040
 and hearings around these, so to speak 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.350
 rubber the mood then takes effect exactly 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.020
 At this point is also here we have 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.510
 water drops but it seems everything 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.450
 to be a table 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:55.890
 I would like to try again 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.890
 dry here in the corners 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 so 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.750
 especially here in the middle 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.660
 coming 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.519
 I'll go around with her again 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:41.379
 not cracked I'll go now 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:43.510
 that was before but I open 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.549
 the other side 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.549
 The crack can listen to miracle 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.180
 is it right off 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.740
 now we are in the middle there this scarce 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.200
 that again demonstrate the money 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.000
 again finished that again into the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.480
 I can do both pure water 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.480
 restore our water vat 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.920
 that I still anything but simple 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920
 good piece 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.310
 now looks pretty good at displays on it 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.740
 are still to work as it 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.740
 be so we can get out 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.010
 to dry 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.010
 so 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.110
 So I have to say the rumors in the 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.590
 Internet are not true 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.020
 the samsung galaxy s 4 is active 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.530
 really waterproof 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.530
 thanks for the towels
