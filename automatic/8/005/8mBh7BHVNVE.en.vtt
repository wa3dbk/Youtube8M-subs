00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.639
 which is enlisted here in new tutorial 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.559
 showing them how to make images 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.170
 animated from minecraft as well as they see it 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.520
 Well, first we'll go to the page that 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.950
 I will leave the link in the description of 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.750
 video and then we will simply choose the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.789
 as well as a template or we want 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.180
 that is here for example I want this 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.350
 of 4 then we 're going here we choose not to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.660
 when I came down here state has been 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.760
 a try with this and can wait 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.960
 an extra load green bar here was 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.960
 but subtract green here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 then of hands, but in the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.260
 that the bar is loaded and you can 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.059
 You can choose the one you want like that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.130
 you and all these models of well that 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.860
 you want no matter the model 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.100
 choose and then there are two ways of 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.710
 upload the image like that from your corner 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.320
 example there are as you see I have so all 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.630
 Mine can do it by load 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.610
 thing 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.440
 loading it from your computer by 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.780
 example here I had mine downloaded 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.940
 and all that or they can also do it from 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 this way they choose the one here where 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.810
 want and give you here look for this player 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.159
 in minecraft dot net 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.790
 and all that we will do is 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:22.050
 write here the name for example d 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.260
 by willy flex 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.970
 what you write and we give you to look 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.220
 then but the one that is loaded we have 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.930
 here all these skin of usa 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.520
 of all time to feel then 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.710
 we choose for example from this one 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.159
 and here let's put the Mr. Vegueta 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.150
 gamer that you are in 377,000 more detail 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.170
 and we are going to look 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.750
 and then I think she's already annoyed 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.940
 to this change can not the lord 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.540
 blond 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.540
 the roof 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.940
 and I hope the one that loads and we choose the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.730
 that you like, for example, be here 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.410
 this is the corner and then here we will see 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.210
 since we have the template of the image 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.670
 or created here if they want to change 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.250
 of skin or user give you here and here 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.960
 and already choose after this and fashionable towards 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 below and we will choose the size that 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.840
 we wish for the image 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.990
 for example 1280 x 720 we choose it and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.020
 here the download will begin 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.310
 to see here you can put this effect and 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.800
 all for example clarity 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:40.690
 to this background fund to know that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.690
 it's because I have not fully tested it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.140
 so they are not just defects of effect of 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.770
 acid image as they saw there was put a 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.240
 little bit clearer for example let's put 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.930
 process that the other other effect of 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.590
 image 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.409
 and wait for it to load to load 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.180
 load the blue bar for example and 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.600
 we have that but I like to annoy 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.570
 lime clarity and we leave it there 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.310
 so that the effect that I 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.960
 liked it badly there you can can 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.950
 choose the effect that you want the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.440
 image that you want 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.950
 characters that you want and you 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.400
 we give to if we choose the format jpg or png 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.790
 jpg gives without the normal image the pj 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.180
 you can edit each one of them 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.720
 these evils of those of the dolls of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.520
 fashion bancrÃ©dito download 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.290
 we wait for the download and 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.530
 we will have here saved as I chose 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.200
 jpg simply as an image where 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.390
 I will show why if I give it to open 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940
 will open me with a program editor and not 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.880
 we want that I just want to see it for 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.290
 that they see how later they download it 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.340
 so let's wait a moment 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:59.600
