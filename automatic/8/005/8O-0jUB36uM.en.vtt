00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 i 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.890
 then we will install the engine 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.720
 the engine is the centerpiece of the des 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.120
 engine 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.710
 that mechanism in charge of converting 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.270
 force of gas explosion 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.270
 rotational energy 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.289
 that at the same time goes through the chain doing 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 turn the wheel and move the motor bike 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.800
 for this in this case we have a 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.250
 bicycle with a box which the tube 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.089
 longer is wider than normal than 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.040
 the seat tube then as the 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.550
 motor comes with a diameter 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.520
 for a tube of the same diameter of all 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.030
 the seat 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.250
 we will make an adaptation that includes 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 in the kit with the flag 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.850
 first we start with removing the others 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.850
 paragraphs 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.310
 to be able to install the motor in a 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.340
 scorecard grow with a diameter 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.950
 higher 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 we will proceed to remove the asparagus 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.909
 to be able to adapt with the plate and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.909
 the true 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.610
 to remove the asparagus 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.630
 we put two of the nuts that in this 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.630
 case 14 mm 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.320
 and simply 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.240
 we put two hours fences stuck 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.020
 Y 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.020
 and we turn 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.750
 we make pressure on the lid 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.480
 lower 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.480
 to the right and he is for Gonzalez 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.049
 and so we have promoted the asparagus 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.310
 we put the plate 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.800
 and screw mos 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.190
 likewise with a depression 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 and the rum was normal 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.440
 and instead of the charge when you forgive 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.959
 for the installation of the motor is very 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.650
 important to use an insulating agent of 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.500
 amusements in this case we will use 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.590
 rubber 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.960
 of packaging that I can dismiss in the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.590
 hardware store in selwo cara 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.300
 and we will put it in the engine unions 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.570
 between the motor and the frame of the 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.040
 bicycle this to ensure this is 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.070
 to reduce the vibrations produced 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.830
 by motor and that the use of motorcycle bike 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.280
 be more comfortable and so it works like a 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.560
 packaging and we test the shelf life of 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.319
 snappers and screws that hug 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.290
 a motor 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.400
 we cut 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.799
 1 we cut 21 to give from this side that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.650
 do not contact me with the picture and 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.250
 this side of the whole diameter of the current 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.730
 asia we cut three packages in total 1 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.300
 for where it hugs the seat 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.300
 in this part 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.190
 between the engine frame 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.190
 1 for the clamp 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.790
 and two just to make up for it to do 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.560
 more arm for here because this is where 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.560
 will be making contact with the box 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.790
 now very carefully 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.620
 we place our equation 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.320
 clear point 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.440
 the hours 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 ah 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.479
 we can see the motor installation 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.479
 completed 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.620
 you can see the rubber on this side to 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.700
 reduce the pressure to the engine and also 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.810
 like on this side 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:20.270
 both of the box 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.270
 and the truth was that it was in this fashion 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.180
 it is important not to press all 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.690
 nuts since you need to install the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.690
 walker
