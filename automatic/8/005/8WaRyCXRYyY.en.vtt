00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I greet you with you again, Alla 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.670
 Kasatkina and the project are paid me today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 we talk about us women and tom 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.340
 amount of money that may be 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 in our life 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.230
 why they are smaller than we wanted 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 would and like this situation in the end 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.340
 you can change how to get money 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 more 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 learn them to rejoice and not at all 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.310
 afraid that we will not have enough of them more often 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.840
 when cash trainings begin when 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 individual money begins 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.420
 consulting with clients first thing 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 i hear from customers yes no of course i 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.070
 I want money but I do not really believe in it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.110
 that they will give me because you look 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.700
 how many people did they get rid of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 so much they only have 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.890
 opportunities they have connections they have 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.230
 mom dad they have a good job u 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.450
 there are 5 10 you know how much 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
 I give the argument I could have 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.219
 collect the whole of such a huge collection and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.890
 like a pack of cards and and shuffle and explain 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.359
 to each of these excuses why 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.010
 no money but why is this happening 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.539
 every man when comes on 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 counseling when I ask him 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.869
 draw draw please yourself and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 money and he himself his life and money he 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.420
 usually draws it I'm so small here 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.470
 this is me this is such a small 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.630
 circle 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.060
 this is my life and this is all this money but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 they are not mine they are here for me this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.400
 A piece does not squeeze into this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 a ring well, how can they not climb 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.259
 but we are each for ourselves 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.530
 center of the universe and that amount of money 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.570
 who we are ready to take our lives 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.460
 depends only on how widely 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.520
 we can spread our hands to meet them 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.470
 that is, are we ready without fear without 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.140
 restrictions without any internal 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.990
 prohibitions take this money will bring in 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.329
 An example is probably the most striking such 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.820
 visual and fastest which year 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.619
 was in my practice in the month of December I 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.990
 conducted one of the cash trainings and 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.770
 I had a wonderful participant there 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 who owns her own shop 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.750
 started her business and she sat in 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.750
 training and complained customers do not go 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620
 the crisis in the yard is no profit I would like 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.580
 one more year 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 no money for it no sales customers 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.860
 some come poking around in the product 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.239
 and leave and I suggested come on 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.430
 let's make a little 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.769
 an experiment just for a couple of days you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.659
 change your attitude to whether you can 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.329
 you in your store get more 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.280
 money just believe it 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.140
 change your attitude to the fact that money 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
 may come despite the crisis and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.849
 despite what happens in others 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.829
 shops and plus you'll be happy 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.140
 any person who will go to 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.329
 you to the store and see what 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.790
 happen next she followed my 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.590
 advice and literally two days later she 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.099
 came to the next lesson in training and 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.900
 said alla i am surprised in my shop 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.090
 three to four times more buyers than in 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.819
 other stones people go rest 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.650
 shops bypass so here's a model 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.810
 my dear then you a good example 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.690
 if we believe if we are ready to understand 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.930
 accept if we are willing to rejoice at it 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.870
 and no doubt we are not limited 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.230
 don't narrow our universe to the very 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.000
 minimum everything appears in our life 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.340
 it turns out that money has a place then 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.410
 when we are ready to give this place but if 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.069
 we do not give this place that money is not 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.049
 will appear 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.500
 so my dear take on arms 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.989
 this little trick and remember what 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.910
 you think about yourself what you think about 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.599
 money what do you think about your 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.120
 opportunities 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.639
 it happens in your lives but oh 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.109
 our fears about emotions about where they live 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.239
 our money we'll talk to you 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.930
