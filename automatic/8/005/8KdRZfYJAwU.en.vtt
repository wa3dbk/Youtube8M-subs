00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.859 
hey guys what's up its candace and today
I'm<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.369> to<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.670> trying<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> make<00:00:15.660> some

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
I'm going to be trying to make some

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.620 
I'm going to be trying to make some
friends<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> don't<00:00:16.860> have<00:00:17.099> any<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.630> most

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
friends because I don't have any as most

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.170 
friends because I don't have any as most
to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.200> gnome<00:00:19.470> because<00:00:20.460> I'm<00:00:20.610> friendless

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to be my gnome because I'm friendless

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.909 
to be my gnome because I'm friendless
that's<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.079> means<00:00:22.259> to<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.439> no<00:00:22.590> friends

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
that's what it means to have no friends

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.970 
that's what it means to have no friends
so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.669> figured<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.660> mean<00:00:24.930> maybe<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.800> could

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
so I figured I mean maybe I could

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
so I figured I mean maybe I could
possibly<00:00:26.130> find<00:00:26.579> like<00:00:26.790> one<00:00:26.969> friend<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.750> two

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
possibly find like one friend or two

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.760 
possibly find like one friend or two

because you know Xbox is obviously the

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.200 
because you know Xbox is obviously the
way<00:00:31.919> to<00:00:31.980> make<00:00:32.189> friends<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> don't<00:00:33.120> have
