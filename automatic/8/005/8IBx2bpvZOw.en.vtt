00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello i will introduce you lapierre 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 believes anton 2014 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 it's a brand new and zesty pen 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.230
 already existed at the range but it is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.960
 completely redesigned for the year 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.150
 next 150 mm of deflection to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.529
 back and front but on the other hand 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 the big novelty lies at the level 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.970
 wheels since now we are 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 wheel of 27.5 which gives it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 more grip and more performance 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.109
 in all conditions for a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.899
 all mountain practice at the frame 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.149
 the design is completely new 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 completely overhauled we wanted to have to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.040
 both a more reliable performance bike 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 more rigid for the performance we 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.460
 have used our system of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 suspension stay longer which is a 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.260
 system patented by lapierre which has the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.559
 peculiarity of being a point system 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.910
 virtual pivot and with 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.920
 systematically the pedaling effort 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.079
 which prevents pumping 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.520
 then at the level of construction in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.460
 she even of a lot more rigid on 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.680
 front + 8% at the bushing 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.900
 housing level 28% stiffness in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 plus and 16% at the triangle level 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.110
 back which gives it a dynamism 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.710
 that we did not have on the models 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890
 previous 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.720
 now at level 2 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.050
 of maintenance we also thought 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.790
 to the user so that this bike can 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.260
 both long lasting and easy 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.900
 to maintain we have axes 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.330
 oversized with bearings 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.400
 waterproof and that are all very easily 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.100
 accessible without having to dismount any 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.770
 bike part at the suspension 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.229
 in itself it's a bike in the test 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.060
 thing were made by nico vouilloz 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.070
 himself 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.470
 so it's a bike that is at once 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.229
 relatively progressive very effective 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.000
 but still a little bit more 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.979
 firm for example that the spicy who 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.420
 use it in the race to be still 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.310
 more nervous having more of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 yield we have optimized the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.990
 pivot point position for 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.210
 modern transmissions in one go 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.910
 plays twice 10 regardless of the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.350
 version 2 believes that you will use 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.690
 the bases are in an alloy 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.429
 of aluminum that we call supreme if 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.709
 what is our magic alloy at 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.110
 lapierre and it's an alloy that is at 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.840
 both lighter and more resistant 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.390
 more reliable than what is done on the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.329
 most bikes on the market so here we go 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.750
 you have an over view of the new 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:31.000
 platform esteem all mountain 2014 I 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 Thank you for listening and have a good ride
