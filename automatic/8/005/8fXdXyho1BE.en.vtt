like this I wanted something a little
bit<00:02:45.500> more<00:02:45.650> tighter<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:47.360> what<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.959> was<00:02:48.050> going<00:02:48.230> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
bit more tighter so what I was going to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.710

say<00:02:48.470> about<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.830> hair<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.910> density<00:02:50.480> or<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720

bundles<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:53.090> okay<00:02:53.900> i<00:02:53.930> think<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.620> should<00:02:54.800> be<00:02:54.890> a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.559 
bundles it's okay i think it should be a
little<00:02:55.130> bit<00:02:55.280> thicker<00:02:55.610> i<00:02:55.819> thought<00:02:56.239> it<00:02:56.360> would<00:02:56.450> be

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
little bit thicker i thought it would be

a little bit thicker for me to have four

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.050 
a little bit thicker for me to have four
bundles<00:02:59.590> but<00:03:00.590> i<00:03:00.920> don't<00:03:01.340> know<00:03:01.549> i<00:03:01.580> haven't<00:03:02.000> had
