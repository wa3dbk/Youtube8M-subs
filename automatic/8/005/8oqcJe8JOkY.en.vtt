00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
let me get that done okay so we've been

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.560 
let me get that done okay so we've been
trying<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.190> blend<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.610> with<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.180> for<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> little

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
trying to blend it with it for a little

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.050 
trying to blend it with it for a little
bit<00:03:13.750> here<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.260> don't<00:03:14.860> think<00:03:15.040> my<00:03:15.070> butter<00:03:15.640> was

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
bit here I don't think my butter was

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.880 
bit here I don't think my butter was
room<00:03:16.540> temperature<00:03:17.080> enough<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.770> not

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
room temperature enough so it's not

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.160 
room temperature enough so it's not
really<00:03:17.950> getting<00:03:18.489> smooth<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.450> what<00:03:19.989> I'm<00:03:20.080> going

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
really getting smooth so what I'm going

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.510 
really getting smooth so what I'm going
to<00:03:20.260> do<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.650> I'm<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:20.830> going<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.070> take<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.280> chance

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
to do is I'm just going to take a chance

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.180 
to do is I'm just going to take a chance
take<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.030> risk<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.660> use<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.620> like<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
take a risk and use it like this and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.800 
take a risk and use it like this and
we'll<00:03:24.580> see<00:03:24.700> how<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:24.850> turns<00:03:24.970> out<00:03:25.330> or<00:03:25.600> skits

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
we'll see how it turns out or skits

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.500 
we'll see how it turns out or skits
enero<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.500> little<00:03:26.770> clumpy<00:03:27.700> our<00:03:28.000> liquor

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
enero it's a little clumpy our liquor

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.060 
enero it's a little clumpy our liquor
but<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.900> should<00:03:29.050> be<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.530> recipe<00:03:29.709> says<00:03:29.890> to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
but it should be the recipe says to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.979 
but it should be the recipe says to
blend<00:03:30.520> until<00:03:30.760> smooth<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.450> don't<00:03:31.630> really<00:03:31.780> see

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
blend until smooth I don't really see

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.140 
blend until smooth I don't really see
that<00:03:32.020> happening<00:03:32.170> with<00:03:32.590> mine<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.670> we'll<00:03:34.000> give

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
that happening with mine so we'll give

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.670 
that happening with mine so we'll give

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
I kept in for a complete 12 minute so

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.790 
I kept in for a complete 12 minute so
what<00:06:42.750> we're<00:06:42.870> going<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:43.050> do<00:06:43.170> now<00:06:43.380> is<00:06:43.410> we're

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
what we're going to do now is we're

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.380 
what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:06:43.890> to<00:06:43.950> let<00:06:44.070> it<00:06:44.100> cool<00:06:44.340> on<00:06:44.520> this<00:06:44.700> wire<00:06:45.000> rack

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
going to let it cool on this wire rack

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.050 
going to let it cool on this wire rack
and<00:06:46.140> it's<00:06:46.590> pretty<00:06:46.800> hot<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.400> I<00:06:47.760> believe

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
and it's pretty hot and I believe

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.730 
and it's pretty hot and I believe
cooling<00:06:48.570> it<00:06:48.690> will<00:06:48.870> let<00:06:49.050> it<00:06:49.080> harden<00:06:49.470> up<00:06:49.710> a

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
cooling it will let it harden up a

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.680 
cooling it will let it harden up a
little<00:06:50.040> as<00:06:50.190> well<00:06:50.370> in<00:06:50.700> the<00:06:51.000> middle<00:06:51.240> of<00:06:51.330> its

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
little as well in the middle of its

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.680 
little as well in the middle of its
pretty<00:06:52.440> pretty<00:06:53.160> soft<00:06:53.430> I<00:06:53.700> mean<00:06:53.880> it's<00:06:54.030> obviously

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
pretty pretty soft I mean it's obviously

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.530
