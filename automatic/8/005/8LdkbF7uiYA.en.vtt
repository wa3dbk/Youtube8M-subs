uh<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.300> went<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
uh you know I think we went into that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.680 
uh you know I think we went into that
game<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.230> confident<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.430> weren't

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
game very confident but we weren't

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.939 
game very confident but we weren't
overconfident<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.050> key<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.739> went

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
overconfident which was key and we went

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
overconfident which was key and we went
out<00:00:56.039> there<00:00:56.219> knowing<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.730> had<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.210> play<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> good

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
out there knowing we had to play a good

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.819 
out there knowing we had to play a good
game<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.219> reach<00:01:00.120> their<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:00.960> well<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.620> think

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
game and reach their game well I think

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.399 
game and reach their game well I think
that<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> key<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.879> us<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.199> just<00:01:04.199> going

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
goal coming into this tournament

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
goal coming into this tournament
obviously<00:01:15.630> winning<00:01:16.259> tournaments<00:01:16.979> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
obviously winning tournaments is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
obviously winning tournaments is
important<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.180> wanted<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> come

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
important but we really wanted to come

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.300 
important but we really wanted to come
out<00:01:18.750> first

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
out first

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.179 
out first
ourselves<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.820> best<00:01:20.079> opportunity<00:01:21.079> of

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
ourselves the best opportunity of

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.100 
ourselves the best opportunity of
qualifying<00:01:22.189> for<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.460> Olympics<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.990> know

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
qualifying for the Olympics and you know

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.420 
qualifying for the Olympics and you know
I<00:01:24.140> think<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.530> was<00:01:24.590> just<00:01:24.829> an<00:01:24.950> overall<00:01:25.280> great

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
I think it was just an overall great

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.179 
I think it was just an overall great
team<00:01:26.270> performance<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.320> often<00:01:27.710> can<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:27.979> get

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
team performance so often can you get

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.429 
team performance so often can you get
caught<00:01:28.430> up<00:01:28.579> in<00:01:28.869> winning<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.990> first<00:01:30.170> two<00:01:30.320> games

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
caught up in winning the first two games

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.319 
caught up in winning the first two games
of<00:01:30.829> this<00:01:31.280> tournament<00:01:31.789> in<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.880> way<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.240> we

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
of this tournament in the way that we

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.080 
of this tournament in the way that we
did<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.899> think<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.409> there<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.369> level<00:01:34.670> in

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
did and I think that there is a level in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.050 
did and I think that there is a level in
a<00:01:35.270> sense<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:35.869> could<00:01:36.080> become<00:01:36.289> complacent

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
a sense that you could become complacent

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060 
a sense that you could become complacent
but<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.899> truth<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.500> we<00:01:39.619> haven't<00:01:39.830> done

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
but the truth is is we haven't done

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.160 
but the truth is is we haven't done
anything<00:01:40.340> yet<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.820> ultimately<00:01:41.509> our<00:01:41.720> goal<00:01:41.750> is

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
anything yet and ultimately our goal is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.830 
anything yet and ultimately our goal is
to<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.220> qualify<00:01:43.429> for<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.970> London<00:01:44.420> Olympics

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
to is to qualify for the London Olympics

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.660 
to is to qualify for the London Olympics
and<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.829> win<00:01:45.979> one<00:01:46.159> more<00:01:46.189> game<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.579> be

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
and we have to win one more game to be

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.060 
and we have to win one more game to be
able<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:46.939> that

from<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.550> Mexico<00:06:05.030> game<00:06:05.270> was<00:06:05.750> when<00:06:06.110> they

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
from the Mexico game was when they

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.760 
from the Mexico game was when they
started<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.770> play<00:06:07.039> direct<00:06:07.789> so<00:06:08.270> they<00:06:08.960> typically

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
started to play direct so they typically

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.469 
started to play direct so they typically
played<00:06:09.979> off<00:06:10.129> the<00:06:10.159> left<00:06:10.490> side<00:06:10.699> they<00:06:11.210> took<00:06:11.360> a

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
played off the left side they took a

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.939 
played off the left side they took a
touchdown<00:06:11.690> their<00:06:11.990> feet<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.379> they<00:06:12.500> hit<00:06:12.650> a<00:06:12.680> big

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
touchdown their feet and they hit a big

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.219 
touchdown their feet and they hit a big
ball<00:06:13.190> now<00:06:13.909> we're<00:06:14.090> not<00:06:14.270> dealing<00:06:14.569> for<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:14.990> front

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
ball now we're not dealing for the front

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.839 
ball now we're not dealing for the front
player<00:06:15.500> with<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.740> same<00:06:16.039> piece<00:06:16.370> so<00:06:16.580> we<00:06:16.669> won't

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
player with the same piece so we won't

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.570 
player with the same piece so we won't
have<00:06:16.969> the<00:06:17.120> same<00:06:17.330> challenges<00:06:17.960> but<00:06:18.620> forwards<00:06:19.310> if

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
have the same challenges but forwards if

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.659 
have the same challenges but forwards if
that<00:06:19.879> were<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.210> happen<00:06:20.240> I<00:06:20.960> think<00:06:21.199> if<00:06:21.319> we<00:06:21.469> just

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
that were to happen I think if we just

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.519 
that were to happen I think if we just
stagger<00:06:22.669> our<00:06:22.879> formation<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.629> little<00:06:23.900> bit<00:06:24.020> here

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
stagger our formation a little bit here

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.159 
stagger our formation a little bit here

but<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:29.990> biggest<00:06:30.319> emphasis<00:06:30.710> I<00:06:31.310> think<00:06:31.639> for<00:06:32.089> the

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
but the biggest emphasis I think for the

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.529 
but the biggest emphasis I think for the
Costa<00:06:32.810> Rica<00:06:33.169> is<00:06:33.550> preserving<00:06:34.550> our<00:06:34.879> energy<00:06:35.360> for

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
Costa Rica is preserving our energy for

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.899 
Costa Rica is preserving our energy for
the<00:06:35.659> attack<00:06:35.960> as<00:06:36.199> much<00:06:36.589> as<00:06:36.800> possible<00:06:37.370> through

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
the attack as much as possible through

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.459 
the attack as much as possible through
our<00:06:37.940> organization<00:06:38.779> and<00:06:38.960> through<00:06:39.319> our

our organization and through our

our organization and through our
communication<00:06:39.889> when<00:06:40.669> we<00:06:40.759> play<00:06:40.969> them<00:06:41.210> last

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690

year<00:06:42.259> they<00:06:42.560> were<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.710> good<00:06:43.009> team<00:06:43.250> and<00:06:43.550> they<00:06:43.610> have

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.700 
year they were a good team and they have
some<00:06:44.029> dangerous<00:06:44.389> attacking<00:06:44.990> players<00:06:45.289> I<00:06:45.680> think

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
some dangerous attacking players I think

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.790 
some dangerous attacking players I think
as<00:06:46.400> a<00:06:46.460> backline<00:06:47.060> we've<00:06:47.360> got
