00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
 and hi everyone and welcome to this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.980
 episode of good start on minecraft 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.630
 episode number 10 today we're talking 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 of enchantment then it'll be a 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 very fast episode I'm just going 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 I will not go through all the details 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.939
 enchantments I leave you a link on 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 the wiki in the description for the yes 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 which you will see you will be able to find the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.640
 description of each enchantment I 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.099
 you just gave the two that I 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 find the games those of the pickaxe because 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.610
 here that are really very helpful 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.710
 that you have to know 20000 immediately I 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.770
 find and I will show you how 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.520
 make enchantments then must 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.219
 you made your table 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.760
 of enchantment so again he 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.980
 is the description I will put the link 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640
 for kraft as usual as 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.399
 all my videos 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.110
 so you have this kind of books 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 who follows you with a very scary look 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 and when you right click 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.469
 on it you can place your object 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.879
 here and here I can do a 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.780
 level 1 chaining then I 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.619
 I am level two which I will not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.689
 to be able to go very far 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.070
 but I could do it I can not 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.540
 I do not have the level but level 3 levels 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.860
 8 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.450
 here but to increase this level 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 knowing that we can go to the level 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.979
 30 now with the new system 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.720
 enchantment 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.100
 we can go to level 30 and for 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.790
 that's going to have to place some 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 libraries of which the same for the craf 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.829
 descriptions and libraries there 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.579
 must to reach the level 30 that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.869
 jeans instead 30 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.290
 so look when I place a 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.090
 library next we see that is all 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.470
 the little symbols that go towards this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.450
 book at wholesale 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 it's a bit like knowing 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 contained in this library was coming 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.980
 in the enchanting table and could 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 to increase the level of 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.180
 enchantment that you do so by 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.140
 example if I put one two three 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.310
 four five six I sent when I 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.600
 I'm going to put that here already I've reached 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.790
 level 13 while just now 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 I was level 5 and I can do the same 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.780
 so I could masters here done 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.030
 there are several ways to arrange them 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:17.100
 I'm going to do it like that and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:22.140
 I'm at then I'm still not there 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.830
 continue hop hop there normally 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.010
 should be good then I miss one 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.010
 swipe 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.770
 because those up there are he 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.600
 seems that they are useless yes in 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.700
 do this one too I'm wrong 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.230
 it does not serve any purpose 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.130
 are there for decoration but good here is a 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.530
 always level 30 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.000
 do I have any leather left? 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.070
 good and good like that we see the craft 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.530
 so the sugarcane you get the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.640
 paper and once you have some 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 paper you make books and a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.500
 once you have books you 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.280
 make libraries 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.690
 hop and free in the middle 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.310
 here you go, I'm just doing this 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.720
 I think it should go 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 I pose here ah well yes but necessarily if 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.670
 I put it there it will not be very useful 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.410
 oh yes I know why it's because 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.080
 I could ask it it should 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.459
 walk 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.470
 yeah okay that's good so 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.240
 actually those who are on the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.100
 third row lalao they serve to 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.720
 nothing is really that of here 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.380
 all the ones around that are going to be 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.209
 useful so here I can reach the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.209
 level 30 so the maximum level 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.650
 little tip now we are 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.200
 more by train has more problem but 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.810
 finally we are in point 3 so we have no 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.040
 the more the problem of making rooms 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.440
 in fact before had to do dirty 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.640
 enchantment regulated the level that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.349
 wanted to get because it was 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.510
 up to level 50 and that it was very 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.519
 complicated some agents 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.410
 some enchantment have a plus 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.450
 big probability of arriving when you 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.430
 are at the maximum level but some 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.380
 enchantment are useful but yet 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.100
 it will not be necessary to be maximum level 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.109
 to get them 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.700
 here I do not know yet 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.690
 new ways to do it with the level 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.690
 30 so I can not tell you exactly 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.069
 to know on the pickaxe the enchantments 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.930
 so it's valid for others 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.199
 tools you can enchanted tools 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.199
 to a wall marc and the pickaxe you have a 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.949
 breaking breaking is until the 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.770
 more read in french 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.050
 that's what makes shatterable I think 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.130
 that's what makes your pickaxe a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.250
 longer durability 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.389
 you have efficient 6 and efficiency in 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.630
 big you undermine the blocks more 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.130
 quickly you have fortune fortune 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.280
 you talked about it on the video of the mining 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.360
 or basically when you're mining for example 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.039
 a block of diamonds or coal 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.960
 there is a chance that gives you none 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.840
 only one but one two three or four 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.449
 and you have if he touch these delicacies 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.740
 basically when you undermine a block he goes 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.720
 you fall back into the hands like you 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.099
 guess a little example it's with 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.020
 the Bible the libraries when I 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.159
 breaks a library 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.090
 it's not going to give me a library that 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.039
 will give me some books 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.259
 I 'll have to spit them 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.509
 the library is good with seal touch 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.340
 logically if I break it that goes me 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.840
 give back directly to the library and 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.560
 I will be able to break glass and recover 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.020
 glass etc 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.729
 so here comes a touch team and 2 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.150
 very very important enchantment in 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.169
 minecraft that allow you to do 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.530
 to do a lot of things so that's 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.340
 it's really very nice so here we go 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.409
 that's about all for 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.270
 enchantment 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:47.349
 again the description if you 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:48.940

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.710
