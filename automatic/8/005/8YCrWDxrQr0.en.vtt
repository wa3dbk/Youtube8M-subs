00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.610
 land tanks are designed to 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.740
 receive the fry and keep them until the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.800
 the end of the rearing phase lasting 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.510
 average 60 days 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.700
 although simple to make the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.860
 construction of these tanks. 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.009
 you need to know which are the main 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.440
 constructive aspects and what are the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.210
 elements of protection and security that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.270
 can be installed 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.090
 the bottom of the tanks shall be 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.609
 level in the transverse direction but 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.789
 should have a difference of 20 to 30 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.399
 centimeters in lengthwise direction 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.829
 as shown in this schematic in 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.500
 which is the side by which the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.489
 water enters its depth should be 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.370
 1 meter 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.460
 already on the other side or at the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.160
 opposite the depth of the tank should 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.210
 be one meter and twenty- one meters and 30 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.970
 centimeters 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 but how do you need to leave a 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.980
 free edge of 20 centimeters 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.740
 it is concluded that the depth of the blade 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.560
 water in the shallower part should be 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.799
 80 cm and in the deepest part 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.840
 it should be from 1 meter to one meter and 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.770
 10 cm independent of the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.040
 length of the water conduction tank 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.970
 since abstraction should be done by 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.009
 gravity 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.799
 therefore tanks should be 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.079
 constructed parallel to each other in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.229
 a lower place of the ground so that 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.270
 water supply is facilitated 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.450
 so that water is fed into 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.969
 masonry or concrete or 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.420
 in pvc pipes should pass 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.250
 parallel to the head of the tanks 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.829
 close to one of the corners at the head of 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.259
 each tank there shall be a 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.920
 masonry to divert the quantity 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.350
 necessary water for each tank in the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.750
 occasions of filling them 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.610
 a higher flow rate should be used to 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.800
 reduce filling time 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.410
 but as soon as he is properly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.900
 the flow of water should be 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.349
 reduced enough just to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.629
 keep it full after the full 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.640
 amount of water that will leave the tank 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.340
 daily 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.860
 It should be as small as possible with the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.880
 careful to keep the border free of 20 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.800
 centimeters 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.550
 nor is it necessary that the water 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.190
 tank will therefore only suffice to supply 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.470
 losses that occur by evaporation in the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.390
 surface of the tank and by infiltration 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.490
 in soil as shown in this scheme the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.860
 flow control devices 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.580
 shall be installed at the exit of the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.430
 boxes 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.280
 which may be records of 100 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:06.220
 millimeters of metal or pvc with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.920
 doors of metal or of wood or 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.100
 same knee pvc with the segment of 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.250
 tube also of pvc both with 100 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.989
 millimeters in diameter 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.940
 in this case the tube must have a 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.580
 length greater than the height of the carton 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.190
 masonry being in position 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.769
 vertical the water supply to the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.630
 tank will be interrupted 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.700
 But as in the knee 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.410
 together with pvc pipe will be 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.810
 turned down 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.720
 water to run out 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.540
 inside the tank and when everything is 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.140
 fully supported on ground the flow of 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.720
 water will be diverted after the maximum 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.970
 water flow control device 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.980
 will be conducted to the tank through 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.950
 a PVC tube with 100 millimeters of 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.780
 diameter to prevent erosion in the tank 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.730
 with the drop in water 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.730
 recommended to protect the soil at the site 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.280
 where it will fall and a 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.000
 piece of plastic canvas fastening the bottom 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.650
 with stones outside of the tank water 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.489
 should be made at the opposite end 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.680
 of greater depth and diagonally in 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.780
 relation to its entry into the tank 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.060
 this can be done using a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.690
 simplified system also made with 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.700
 pvc pipes a rigid pipe of 100 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.310
 millimeters in diameter should cross 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.610
 the landfill close to the bottom of the tank 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.830
 to allow water to flow out of the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.500
 end of the tube that is inside the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.030
 tank should be placed 90-foot 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.580
 degrees to fit another pvc tube 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.230
 c also with 100 millimeters in diameter 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 vertically 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.270
 its length should be sufficient 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.070
 to reach the recommended height for the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.860
 water level in the tank 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.430
 ie from one meter to one meter and 10 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.980
 How is it desirable to remove the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.060
 Background water tank and maintain the 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.490
 surface 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.170
 recommends placing around the pipe 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.470
 vertical of 100 mm 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.930
 another pvc tube with 150 millimeters of 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.070
 diameter and 20 centimeters larger than 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.980
 first 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.590
 it should be freely supported 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.540
 on the knee as shown 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.390
 in this scheme 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:26.330
 so the water will only come out of the tank 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:29.030
 when the desired level has been reached and 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.490
 when it is necessary to empty the tank 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.130
 sufficient to remove these tubes 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.000
 practically all water is trained 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.000
 out of the same
