00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
so here in front of you have three new

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.820 
so here in front of you have three new
kinds<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.510> cancer<00:00:03.840> shells<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.560> I'm<00:00:04.620> pretty

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
kinds of cancer shells that I'm pretty

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950 
kinds of cancer shells that I'm pretty
excited<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.190> test<00:00:05.460> out<00:00:05.670> all<00:00:06.359> these<00:00:06.600> shells<00:00:06.810> are

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
excited to test out all these shells are

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.419 
excited to test out all these shells are
actually<00:00:07.200> part<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.589> fourth<00:00:07.830> July<00:00:08.160> stash

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
actually part of my fourth July stash

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.339 
actually part of my fourth July stash
for<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.820> year<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:09.300> they<00:00:09.900> will<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.139> used

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
for this year and so they will be used

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.810 
for this year and so they will be used
throughout<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.800> display<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.429> video<00:00:11.700> we

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
throughout the display and this video we

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.999 
throughout the display and this video we
posted<00:00:12.179> afterwards<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.200> probably<00:00:13.950> be

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
posted afterwards so you probably be

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560 
posted afterwards so you probably be
able<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> determine<00:00:14.429> which<00:00:14.700> which<00:00:15.240> shells

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
able to determine which which shells

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.880 
able to determine which which shells
these<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.929> during<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.289> place<00:00:16.500> there's<00:00:16.770> me

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
these are during this place there's me

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.160 
these are during this place there's me
tons<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.190> stuff<00:00:17.400> going<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:17.970> since<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.900> like

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
tons of stuff going on but since I like

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.660 
tons of stuff going on but since I like
these<00:00:19.350> shells<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.279> know<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> haven't<00:00:20.520> seen

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
these shells and you know I haven't seen

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
these shells and you know I haven't seen
a<00:00:20.730> lot<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> videos<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.240> these<00:00:21.420> shells<00:00:21.630> I'm

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
a lot of videos on these shells I'm

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.540 
a lot of videos on these shells I'm
going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.590> ahead<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> save<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> couple<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
going to go ahead and save a couple and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.120 
going to go ahead and save a couple and
do<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> video<00:00:23.880> which<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.689> right<00:00:24.810> here

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
do a video which is this one right here

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.349 
do a video which is this one right here
okay<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.609> look<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> shells

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
okay so if we take a look at the shells

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
okay so if we take a look at the shells
individually<00:00:28.050> wrap<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> bat<00:00:28.920> you'll<00:00:29.070> notice

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
individually wrap the bat you'll notice

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
individually wrap the bat you'll notice
that<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> middle<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> Super<00:00:30.750> Bob

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that the one in the middle the Super Bob

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.400 
that the one in the middle the Super Bob
is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.890> taller<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:33.030> don't<00:00:33.660> let<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.960> fool

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
is a lot taller now don't let that fool

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.709 
is a lot taller now don't let that fool
you<00:00:34.649> because<00:00:34.910> if<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> top<00:00:36.480> right

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
you because if you look in the top right

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.690 
you because if you look in the top right
here<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.100> there's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
here you can see there's a little bit of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.119 
here you can see there's a little bit of
a<00:00:38.820> gap<00:00:39.090> before<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.960> actual<00:00:40.170> plug<00:00:40.469> it's

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
a gap before the actual plug it's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.459 
a gap before the actual plug it's
probably<00:00:41.579> probably<00:00:42.030> half<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.390> inch<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.410> if

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
probably probably half an inch and so if

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.299 
probably probably half an inch and so if
you<00:00:43.530> took<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.739> half<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.010> inch<00:00:44.129> should

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you took out half an inch should

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
you took out half an inch should
probably<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.969> finger<00:00:45.329> yeah<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:46.050> right

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
probably be our my finger yeah be right

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
probably be our my finger yeah be right
where<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.469> finger<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.800> same<00:00:47.579> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> tell

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
where my finger is same kind of tell

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.450 
where my finger is same kind of tell
it's<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.840> little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.230> taller<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's just a little bit taller but if you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810 
it's just a little bit taller but if you
look<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> diameter<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
look at the diameter it's also just a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
look at the diameter it's also just a
little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.510> smaller<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:56.039> fact<00:00:56.250> that's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
little bit smaller so the fact that's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.000 
little bit smaller so the fact that's
taller<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.780> made<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
taller you know it's made up for the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.920 
taller you know it's made up for the
small<00:00:59.609> diameter<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> gap<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
small diameter and then the gap in the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
small diameter and then the gap in the
top<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:02.100> shell<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> country<00:01:02.760> slammer

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
top so this shell the country slammer

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
top so this shell the country slammer
you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> says<00:01:04.290> yellow

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you can see right there it says yellow

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
you can see right there it says yellow
wave<00:01:05.519> blue<00:01:05.939> pearls<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> effect

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
wave blue pearls I like how the effect

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.390 
wave blue pearls I like how the effect
is<00:01:07.170> labeled<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.100> there

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
is labeled right on there

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.980 
is labeled right on there
like<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> has<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.510> arrow<00:01:09.630> telling<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
like how it has an arrow telling you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
like how it has an arrow telling you
which<00:01:10.140> end<00:01:10.320> goes<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.799> case<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.280> some

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
which end goes up in case you some

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
which end goes up in case you some
reason<00:01:11.820> didn't<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:13.140> also

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
reason didn't know that and then also

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.859 
reason didn't know that and then also
like<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.890> way<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> fuses<00:01:14.549> uh<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.509> fuse<00:01:15.750> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
like the way the fuses uh the fuse is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
like the way the fuses uh the fuse is
taped<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.770> literally<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.100> pull<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.549> like

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
taped up you literally just pull up like

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
taped up you literally just pull up like
this<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> fuse<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.270> come<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
this in the fuse will come right out you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
this in the fuse will come right out you
can<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> coating<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.280> there

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
can also see there's a coating on there

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.230 
can also see there's a coating on there
on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> tip<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> fuse<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
on the tip of the fuse so I like this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.990 
on the tip of the fuse so I like this
show<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.200> set<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
show a lot just the way it's set up and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
show a lot just the way it's set up and
you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> feels<00:01:27.330> feels<00:01:27.780> pretty<00:01:27.990> heavy<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you know it feels feels pretty heavy it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
you know it feels feels pretty heavy it
seems<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.369> well<00:01:29.549> packaged<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.390> really

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
seems to be well packaged so I really

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
seems to be well packaged so I really
like<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.470> done<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.189> look<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.490> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like the way that's done so look at this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
like the way that's done so look at this
one<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> Super<00:01:33.360> Bob<00:01:33.950> there's<00:01:34.950> no

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
one this is the Super Bob there's no

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.499 
one this is the Super Bob there's no
effect<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> that's<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
effect on there which is that's not a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
effect on there which is that's not a
big<00:01:36.689> deal<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.799> always<00:01:37.950> nice<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> know

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
big deal but it's always nice to know

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
big deal but it's always nice to know
especially<00:01:38.640> once<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:38.970> take<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
especially once you take them out the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
especially once you take them out the
package<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> stuff<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.799> got

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
package of stuff kind of what you got

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
package of stuff kind of what you got
what<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.460> each<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.790> each

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
what you got in each and in each

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.810 
what you got in each and in each
individual<00:01:42.659> shell<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> said<00:01:44.700> before

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
individual shell so like I said before

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
individual shell so like I said before
the<00:01:45.060> dam<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.600> bit<00:01:45.689> smaller<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the dam is a little bit smaller and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
the dam is a little bit smaller and
there's<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:46.770> gap<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> top<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.700> even

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
there's a little gap in the top but even

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
there's a little gap in the top but even
still<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.560> little

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
still it's just it's like just a little

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.399 
still it's just it's like just a little
bit<00:01:50.070> bigger<00:01:50.310> than<00:01:50.790> these<00:01:50.970> other<00:01:51.149> shells<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
bit bigger than these other shells so I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
bit bigger than these other shells so I
hope<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.040> hope<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.630> weight

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
hope that's hope that's good the weight

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.830 
hope that's hope that's good the weight
feels<00:01:54.990> pretty<00:01:55.200> good<00:01:56.360> like<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.420> said<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> says

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
feels pretty good like I said it says

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
feels pretty good like I said it says
right<00:01:58.079> here<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.530> end<00:01:58.740> up<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.399> doesn't

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
right here this end up but doesn't

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.249 
right here this end up but doesn't
really<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.850> any<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.090> indication<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.020> what

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
really have any other indication on what

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
really have any other indication on what
the<00:02:01.380> shell<00:02:01.590> does<00:02:01.740> anything<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.219> also

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the shell does anything like that also

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
the shell does anything like that also
the<00:02:03.270> way<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> fuse<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> done<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.560> pretty<00:02:04.890> easy

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the way the fuse is done is pretty easy

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.679 
the way the fuse is done is pretty easy
you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.850> pull<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.450> here

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you can see just pull this right here

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.270 
you can see just pull this right here
and<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.840> would<00:02:06.930> come<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.069> fuse

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and it would come right out on the fuse

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.430 
and it would come right out on the fuse
is<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.520> coated<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> huge<00:02:10.289> deal

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is not coated which is not a huge deal

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.720 
is not coated which is not a huge deal
I'm<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.739> saying<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.250> only<00:02:11.430> ones<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.640> are

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
I'm just saying the only ones that are

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.470 
I'm just saying the only ones that are
coated<00:02:11.970> they<00:02:12.209> tend<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.599> light<00:02:12.750> easier

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
coated they tend to light easier

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.350 
coated they tend to light easier
okay<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.590> last<00:02:14.739> show<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
okay so the last show we have the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.440 
okay so the last show we have the
javelin<00:02:16.840> by<00:02:17.560> caliber<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:19.209> like<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
javelin by caliber and I really like the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270 
javelin by caliber and I really like the
way<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.720> shell<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:19.959> done<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:21.160> got

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
way this shell is done because it's got

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.070 
way this shell is done because it's got
the<00:02:21.340> top<00:02:21.519> on<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:21.879> it's<00:02:22.690> got<00:02:22.870> an<00:02:22.930> arrow

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
the top on there it's got an arrow

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.020 
the top on there it's got an arrow
telling<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.500> which<00:02:23.620> ways<00:02:23.800> up<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.580> also<00:02:24.790> got

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
telling you which ways up it's also got

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.850 
telling you which ways up it's also got
a<00:02:25.060> bottom<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.569> there<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.959> haven't<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:26.709> seen

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
a bottom on there I haven't really seen

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.080 
a bottom on there I haven't really seen
a<00:02:26.920> lot<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.129> that<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.430> kind<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.700> cool

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
a lot of that so that's kind of cool

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.270 
a lot of that so that's kind of cool
also<00:02:28.540> has<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.660> effect<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.680> there<00:02:29.920> so

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
also has the effect right on there so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.339 
also has the effect right on there so
silver<00:02:30.700> palm<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.180> red<00:02:31.390> glitter<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.810> then

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
silver palm with red glitter and then

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.160 
silver palm with red glitter and then
it's<00:02:32.470> got<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> brand<00:02:32.890> on<00:02:33.040> there<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:35.110> know

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it's got the brand on there so you know

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.750 
it's got the brand on there so you know
I<00:02:35.200> really<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> way<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.830> set<00:02:36.340> up<00:02:36.489> and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
I really like the way this is set up and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.729 
I really like the way this is set up and
it<00:02:36.940> feels<00:02:38.340> they're<00:02:39.340> about<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.610> same<00:02:39.760> weight

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
it feels they're about the same weight

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.170 
it feels they're about the same weight
I'd<00:02:41.739> say<00:02:41.980> maybe<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.370> country<00:02:42.700> singer<00:02:42.970> feels<00:02:43.150> a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
I'd say maybe the country singer feels a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.520 
I'd say maybe the country singer feels a
little<00:02:43.239> bit<00:02:43.390> heavier<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.140> could<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.349> be

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
little bit heavier but it could just be

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.350 
little bit heavier but it could just be
the<00:02:44.560> each<00:02:45.069> individual<00:02:45.519> shell<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.970> know<00:02:46.090> could

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the each individual shell you know could

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.880 
the each individual shell you know could
be<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> little<00:02:46.630> bit<00:02:46.720> different<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.650> anyways

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
be a little bit different so anyways

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.470 
be a little bit different so anyways
that's<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.400> my<00:02:48.549> oh<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.120> way<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.299> fuse

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
that's just my oh the way the fuse

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.000 
that's just my oh the way the fuse
wrapped<00:02:49.660> up<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.019> exact<00:02:50.470> same<00:02:50.680> as<00:02:50.920> this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
wrapped up is this exact same as this

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.289 
wrapped up is this exact same as this
one<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.370> mean<00:02:51.549> it's<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.730> same<00:02:51.880> brand<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.269> you

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
one I mean it's the same brand so you

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.449 
one I mean it's the same brand so you
kind<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.630> assumed<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.230> would<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.920> same<00:02:54.190> way

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
kind of assumed it would be the same way

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.210 
kind of assumed it would be the same way
and<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.120> same<00:02:55.269> effect<00:02:55.920> anyway<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.160> can

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
and the same effect anyway so you can

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.740 
and the same effect anyway so you can
see<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:57.849> pull<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.150> right<00:02:58.329> up<00:02:58.390> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
see that you just pull that right up and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.449 
see that you just pull that right up and
it<00:02:59.049> also<00:02:59.200> has<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.560> coating<00:02:59.890> right<00:03:00.040> there<00:03:00.250> on

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
it also has the coating right there on

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.089 
it also has the coating right there on
the<00:03:00.730> fuse<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:02.709> soon<00:03:02.799> as<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.920> gets<00:03:03.010> dark

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
the fuse so as soon as it gets dark

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.920 
the fuse so as soon as it gets dark
we'll<00:03:03.370> take<00:03:03.579> these<00:03:03.730> outside<00:03:03.910> well<00:03:04.660> shoot<00:03:04.840> them

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
we'll take these outside well shoot them

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.750 
we'll take these outside well shoot them
off<00:03:05.019> individually<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.310> know<00:03:06.370> I'm<00:03:06.459> gonna<00:03:06.610> try

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
off individually you know I'm gonna try

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.339 
off individually you know I'm gonna try
to<00:03:06.819> match<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.360> effects<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.930> won't<00:03:08.110> be<00:03:08.170> hard

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
to match the effects this won't be hard

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.890 
to match the effects this won't be hard
because<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.620> doesn't<00:03:09.040> tell<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.280> what<00:03:09.400> affects

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
because it doesn't tell you what affects

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.300 
because it doesn't tell you what affects
even<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.079> Box<00:03:11.349> doesn't<00:03:11.620> say<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.980> effect<00:03:12.160> on

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
even the Box doesn't say the effect on

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.610 
even the Box doesn't say the effect on
there<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.180> kind<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.230> know<00:03:14.349> that

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
there so that kind of a you know that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.440 
there so that kind of a you know that
might<00:03:14.829> be<00:03:14.920> deterrence<00:03:15.400> for<00:03:15.549> some<00:03:15.700> people<00:03:16.030> but

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
might be deterrence for some people but

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.270 
might be deterrence for some people but
these<00:03:16.840> ones<00:03:16.989> we<00:03:17.170> can<00:03:17.290> match<00:03:17.440> up<00:03:17.470> there's<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
these ones we can match up there's the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.400 
these ones we can match up there's the
same<00:03:18.459> brand<00:03:18.760> though<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.690> know<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.139> assume

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
same brand though so you know you assume

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.349 
same brand though so you know you assume
that<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> effects<00:03:20.950> would<00:03:21.130> or<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.459> shells

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
that the effects would or the shells

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.580 
that the effects would or the shells
will<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.630> similar<00:03:23.130> effect<00:03:25.380> anyways

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
will have the similar effect anyways

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.840 
will have the similar effect anyways
suza<00:03:26.889> gets<00:03:27.040> dark<00:03:27.220> we'll<00:03:27.310> go<00:03:27.400> outside<00:03:27.489> we'll

suza gets dark we'll go outside we'll

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.430 
suza gets dark we'll go outside we'll
