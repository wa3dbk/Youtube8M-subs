from<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> rest<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
from the rest you think it is just the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.570 
from the rest you think it is just the
work<00:01:38.399> I<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:39.020> not<00:01:40.020> only<00:01:40.050> his<00:01:40.380> work<00:01:40.560> ethic<00:01:41.160> but

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
work I think not only his work ethic but

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.090 
work I think not only his work ethic but
his<00:01:41.759> commitment<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.479> also<00:01:43.020> his<00:01:43.320> appreciation

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
his commitment and also his appreciation

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.389 
his commitment and also his appreciation
of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> guys<00:01:44.580> who<00:01:44.789> came<00:01:45.000> before<00:01:45.180> him<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:46.280> got<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of the guys who came before him I got to

this game and laid the foundation for my
father<00:01:56.399> Walt<00:01:56.820> Hazzard<00:01:57.060> was<00:01:57.479> from

father Walt Hazzard was from

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.620 
father Walt Hazzard was from
Philadelphia<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:59.340> Kobe<00:01:59.789> and<00:02:00.060> had<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
Philadelphia just like Kobe and had a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.380 
Philadelphia just like Kobe and had a
hand<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.170> helping<00:02:01.380> his<00:02:01.740> father<00:02:02.149> come<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.270> in

hand in helping his father come up in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 
hand in helping his father come up in
the<00:02:03.509> game<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:05.040> saw<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> respect<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.330> he

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the game and I saw the respect that he

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.080 
the game and I saw the respect that he
showed<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:07.080> dad<00:02:07.350> firsthand<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.820> way<00:02:08.970> he

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
showed my dad firsthand the way he

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.870 
showed my dad firsthand the way he
treated<00:02:09.420> him<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.830> he<00:02:11.040> admired<00:02:11.370> him<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
treated him the way he admired him and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.690 
treated him the way he admired him and
that<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:13.019> sets<00:02:13.560> him<00:02:13.739> apart<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.459> think

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that also sets him apart from I think

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.959 
that also sets him apart from I think
many<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> guys<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.630> his<00:02:15.720> League
