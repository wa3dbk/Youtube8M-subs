00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
for the first time but as we move from

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.549 
for the first time but as we move from
the<00:00:42.250> game<00:00:42.570> zombies<00:00:43.570> also<00:00:43.720> evolved<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.440> they

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
the game zombies also evolved so they

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:45.930 
the game zombies also evolved so they
get<00:00:44.680> more<00:00:44.830> intense<00:00:45.190> more<00:00:45.460> scary<00:00:45.729> more

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
aggressive and oh they start the game by

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.710 
aggressive and oh they start the game by
being<00:00:48.280> more<00:00:48.519> slow<00:00:48.850> they<00:00:49.180> eventually<00:00:49.360> end<00:00:49.690> up

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
being more slow they eventually end up

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.180 
being more slow they eventually end up
climbing<00:00:50.110> up<00:00:50.170> ladders<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.650> breaching<00:00:50.979> walls

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
funny when we first started the game we

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.820

is<00:01:06.040> one<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.400> key<00:01:06.640> narrative<00:01:07.420> features

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
is one of the key narrative features

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.600 
is one of the key narrative features
that<00:01:08.380> obviously<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.920> survivor<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.460> might

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
that obviously a survivor that might

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.640 
that obviously a survivor that might
last<00:01:09.790> all<00:01:10.119> of<00:01:10.330> anywhere<00:01:10.720> between<00:01:10.810> 10<00:01:11.200> seconds

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
last all of anywhere between 10 seconds

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.440
