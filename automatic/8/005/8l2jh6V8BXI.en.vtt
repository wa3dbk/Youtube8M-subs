okay we're going to do a quick little
video<00:00:02.930> of<00:00:03.440> the<00:00:03.770> dreaded<00:00:04.220> no<00:00:04.820> spark<00:00:05.300> on<00:00:05.570> a

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:05.630 
video of the dreaded no spark on a

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:13.540 
video of the dreaded no spark on a
raptor<00:00:06.259> and<00:00:06.680> the<00:00:07.670> mysterious<00:00:09.280> red<00:00:10.280> wire<00:00:12.550> that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
raptor and the mysterious red wire that

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.510 
raptor and the mysterious red wire that
one<00:00:16.510> okay<00:00:17.510> as<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.779> can<00:00:17.930> see<00:00:18.140> my<00:00:18.500> rectifier<00:00:19.039> is

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
one okay as you can see my rectifier is

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.510 
one okay as you can see my rectifier is
in<00:00:20.000> fact<00:00:20.980> plugged<00:00:21.980> in<00:00:23.080> this<00:00:24.080> is<00:00:24.260> a<00:00:24.289> no<00:00:24.470> three<00:00:24.920> so

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
in fact plugged in this is a no three so

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.090 
in fact plugged in this is a no three so
it's<00:00:25.670> on<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:25.939> side<00:00:26.180> here<00:00:26.390> by<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:26.570> reservoir

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
it's on the side here by the reservoir

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.950 
it's on the side here by the reservoir
spark<00:00:28.100> plugs<00:00:28.400> already<00:00:28.730> pulled<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:30.380> position

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
spark plugs already pulled in position

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:47.049 
spark plugs already pulled in position
kion<00:00:40.749> unplug<00:00:41.749> the<00:00:41.929> rectifier<00:00:45.760> rectifier<00:00:46.760> is

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
kion unplug the rectifier rectifier is

00:00:47.059 --> 00:01:10.270 
kion unplug the rectifier rectifier is
unplugged<00:00:50.409> kion<00:01:08.259> okay<00:01:09.259> now<00:01:09.829> we're<00:01:09.950> gonna<00:01:10.039> plug

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
unplugged kion okay now we're gonna plug

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.980 
unplugged kion okay now we're gonna plug
the<00:01:10.430> rectifier<00:01:10.850> back<00:01:11.149> in<00:01:16.659> show<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:17.810> that

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the rectifier back in show you that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:30.969 
the rectifier back in show you that
there<00:01:18.170> is<00:01:18.200> no<00:01:18.469> spark<00:01:18.859> now<00:01:27.280> now<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:30.590> are<00:01:30.710> going

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
there is no spark now now we are going

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
there is no spark now now we are going
to<00:01:31.159> cut<00:01:31.399> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:46.370

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this red water you can see it here right

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.419 
this red water you can see it here right
here<00:01:53.830> on<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.560> connector<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.679> goes<00:01:56.740> out<00:01:57.070> of

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
here on the connector that goes out of

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.639 
here on the connector that goes out of
the<00:01:57.670> her<00:01:58.000> food<00:01:58.240> adder<00:01:58.600> right<00:01:58.929> here<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.439> way

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
the her food adder right here this way

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.950 
the her food adder right here this way
right<00:01:59.890> here<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.939> thing<00:02:01.420> down<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.810> one

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
right here just thing down for one

right here just thing down for one
minute<00:02:04.020> okay<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.760> wire<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.180> cut<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
minute okay the wire is cut the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.920 
minute okay the wire is cut the
rectifier<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.390> fact<00:02:17.760> plugged<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:21.930> spark

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
rectifier is in fact plugged in spark

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.009 
rectifier is in fact plugged in spark
plug<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.230> position<00:02:23.620> key<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.810> go

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
plug in position key on and there you go

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.470 
plug in position key on and there you go
there<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.640> confirmed

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
there you have it it is confirmed

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.050 
there you have it it is confirmed
red<00:02:34.900> wire<00:02:35.110> cut<00:02:36.000> there's<00:02:37.000> no<00:02:37.209> spark<00:02:37.630> situation

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
red wire cut there's no spark situation

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.289 
red wire cut there's no spark situation
can<00:02:40.060> possibly<00:02:40.540> revive<00:02:41.200> your<00:02:41.350> Raptor<00:02:42.209> have<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
can possibly revive your Raptor have a

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.630 
can possibly revive your Raptor have a
