of<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.159> tire<00:01:51.400> exactly<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.510> that's<00:01:52.630> one<00:01:52.930> way<00:01:53.110> you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
of a tire exactly so that's one way you

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.859 
of a tire exactly so that's one way you
can<00:01:53.470> reduce<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.130> hang<00:01:54.820> back<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.720> got

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
can reduce it is hang back so you got

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.500 
can reduce it is hang back so you got
more<00:01:56.049> vision<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.860> reaction<00:01:57.640> time<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:57.970> space

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
more vision and reaction time and space

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.300 
more vision and reaction time and space
to<00:01:58.659> get<00:01:58.810> around<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.680> don't<00:01:59.920> ride<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.250> the
