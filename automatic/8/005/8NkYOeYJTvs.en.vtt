here's the bridge and the bridge is now
graphtec<00:00:35.120> sounds<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:37.489> deal<00:00:37.699> with<00:00:37.850> the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
graphtec sounds and the deal with the

graphtec sounds and the deal with the
graphtec<00:00:38.449> settles<00:00:38.960> I<00:00:39.199> like<00:00:39.589> these<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.870> I've

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
graphtec settles I like these and I've

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.869 
graphtec settles I like these and I've
used<00:00:42.469> them<00:00:42.649> off<00:00:42.769> and<00:00:42.949> on<00:00:43.039> on<00:00:43.070> my<00:00:43.249> strats<00:00:43.579> quite

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
used them off and on on my strats quite

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:44.770 
used them off and on on my strats quite
a<00:00:43.909> bit

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
a bit

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.509 
a bit
now<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:45.320> notice<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:45.890> bridge<00:00:46.190> though

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
now you notice on the bridge though

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.329 
now you notice on the bridge though
they're<00:00:47.269> backed<00:00:47.690> up<00:00:48.079> really<00:00:48.679> far<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.010> get<00:00:49.219> them

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
they're backed up really far to get them

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.970 
they're backed up really far to get them
to<00:00:49.460> Antony<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.659> it's<00:00:51.260> up<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.710> whether<00:00:51.890> or

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.919 
to Antony so it's up to you whether or
not<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.309> want<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.579> do<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.879> in<00:00:53.030> fact<00:00:53.300> on<00:00:53.510> the

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
not you want to do that in fact on the

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.279 
not you want to do that in fact on the
low<00:00:54.079> E<00:00:54.319> string<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.300> maybe<00:00:56.300> even<00:00:56.569> a<00:00:56.629> string<00:00:57.140> you

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
low E string and maybe even a string you

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.040 
low E string and maybe even a string you
may<00:00:57.469> have<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:58.120> cut<00:00:59.120> your<00:00:59.239> spring<00:00:59.569> a<00:00:59.719> little<00:00:59.809> bit

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
may have to cut your spring a little bit

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.439 
may have to cut your spring a little bit
to<00:01:00.170> back<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.589> up<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.829> get<00:01:00.949> it<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.190> Antony<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.149> my

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
to back it up to get it to Antony and my

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.210 
to back it up to get it to Antony and my
tech<00:01:02.719> ended<00:01:03.079> up<00:01:03.199> having<00:01:03.499> to<00:01:03.559> do<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:03.920> so

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
tech ended up having to do that so

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.530 
tech ended up having to do that so
that's<00:01:04.460> going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> be<00:01:04.790> your<00:01:04.940> call<00:01:05.150> I<00:01:05.180> think<00:01:05.449> on

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
that's going to be your call I think on

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.600 
that's going to be your call I think on
my<00:01:05.630> next<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:06.050> probably<00:01:06.320> won't<00:01:06.680> do<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.130> but<00:01:07.549> I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
my next one I probably won't do it but I

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.190 
my next one I probably won't do it but I
usually<00:01:07.909> put<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.119> graft<00:01:08.360> X<00:01:08.600> on<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:08.990> that's<00:01:09.079> the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
usually put the graft X on so that's the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.850 
usually put the graft X on so that's the
graph<00:01:09.439> Tech's

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
graph Tech's

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.859 
graph Tech's
you<00:01:10.549> guys<00:01:10.729> can<00:01:10.880> see<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.119> pickups<00:01:11.509> these<00:01:11.750> are

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
you guys can see the pickups these are

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.350 
you guys can see the pickups these are

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.179 
Bill Lawrence USA's I'm partial to those
they've<00:01:14.750> got<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:14.960> lot<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.259> output<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.920> bridge

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
they've got a lot of output to bridge

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.670 
they've got a lot of output to bridge
pickups<00:01:16.640> kind<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.000> bright<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.229> have<00:01:18.560> it

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
pickups kind of bright so I have it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.499 
pickups kind of bright so I have it
lowered<00:01:19.070> let<00:01:19.399> me<00:01:19.460> change<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.909> angle<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:20.450> you

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
lowered let me change the angle so you

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.300 
lowered let me change the angle so you
can<00:01:20.630> see<00:01:20.719> how<00:01:21.079> I<00:01:21.110> have<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:23.920> it's<00:01:24.920> been<00:01:25.100> lowered

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
can see how I have it it's been lowered

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.230 
can see how I have it it's been lowered
down<00:01:25.549> quite<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.880> bit

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
down quite a bit

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.440
