00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.720
 hello my crafter and welcome 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.880
 to a small tutorial for whether deep 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.520
 one in the version 1.7 there the whole 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.980
 now at 1.7 2 and 1 point 7 4 already 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.450
 pretty sure I run I just want 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.010
 again follow the tutorial because 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.289
 I always find it stupid if you are so old 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.520
 tutorials just rename yes if 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.619
 you actually see that is still for 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.070
 the 1.5 but we are a bit 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.690
 continue 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.460
 and why do the tutorial today 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.500
 new and we start with it as always 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.350
 that we first in ours 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.429
 Minecraft folder go with percent app 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.170
 data then in the roaming folder and in 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.460
 the point minecraft folder retain 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.139
 just have to open the moment first 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.639
 We want it at the moment 

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:41.109
 Do not do anything because we have to 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:43.059
 also if downloading low 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.949
 I'll go for it as always 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.539
 minecraft - mobbing the mod side 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.449
 of my trust and there in the 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.219
 minecraft mod list 1.7 we search then 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.129
 if the fine out I see here for the 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.280
 1.7 4 1.7 2 but I was also doing 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.649
 I will now first for the 1.7 2 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.389
 Just install the reason that 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.559
 for the 1.7 4, for example 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.629
 no progress and I want to 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.280
 show both ways and maybe also 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.570
 a little problematic that is there 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.760
 That's why I'm just loading this 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.160
 Just download it here 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.720
 and who gets windows used now 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.250
 here mostly this error that yes files 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.660
 your security risk and so on 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.000
 just click on keep 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.380
 at least at minecraft modding de must 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.820
 I make no'm worried 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.770
 I put on the whole time on the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.810
 desktop so and now we have two 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.460
 possibilities to install the whole 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.410
 we have the possibility that without forge 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.990
 to install and with fortune 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.460
 first try the without forge 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.810
 but I have to say that it may 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.640
 sometimes problems sometimes come 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.880
 Sometimes that does not work for me 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 I do not know what this is dependent on 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.340
 that's really easy for you 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.409
 you can double-click on it 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.000
 at least if you are here with this file 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.260
 the year was symbolic should see that 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.900
 not the case be a right click 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.159
 open with and then open with java if 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.350
 this is not included here 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.080
 standard search raussuchen 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 Just have a look and the program tells us 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.370
 already that the installer now 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.110
 automatically everything will be present as well 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.240
 create a new profile with opti fein 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.800
 Just press install and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.659
 schwuppdiwupp is completely installed 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.489
 I would like to try that out now 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.049
 As I said, it can sometimes 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.999
 problems come and I'm curious if 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.590
 she once worked it is safer 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.180
 I just the forge variant that I have 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.739
 then immediately want to introduce 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.060
 but let's try it out 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.129
 see the rag has benefited actively 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 selected with a whether the fine version 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.389
 1.7 2 if that is not the case 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.879
 take it easy and profile and here then 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.980
 select the right version sda part 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.920
 I have a few commands here 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.450
 attached you will find in opti fine 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.739
 minecraft forum if not now 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.329
 knows where they come from without the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.219
 actually runs even rarer 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.269
 I will too and the video still 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.519
 So just hang on 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.049
 watch if it comes with progress 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.999
 he's a bit more who because 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.099
 there we see the profile and save it 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.420
 Once on play this should be back 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.650
 installation up to here already not at 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.269
 It could have worked for you 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.310
 Maybe you are the version 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.590
 1.7 have never used before 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.230
 next to the game first in the raw state 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.269
 start without mods without us and we 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.279
 see it did not work out i know in 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.439
 the case was not why I had 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:07.239
 already round or try where that 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.819
 I worked really well 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.109
 not say why it should be 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.909
 Just try it out as I said 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.739
 recommend the forge variant and the 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.480
 Now you have to do that as the next one 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.739
 First of all I would like to install it 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.730
 I do not do extra here right now because 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.829
 there are always a few things 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.060
 to say you can see now on the top left 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.129
 very fast who does not have it 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.849
 is in the end synonymous over a there 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.930
 easy to install 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.359
 Now we have to minecraft a point 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.459
 folder and if you forge 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.499
 you have also installed in the folder 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.290
 and in the 1.7 it is actually quite 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.769
 simply regulated then public mods 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 folder 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.029
 we pull the file in here and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.799
 then can the minecraft folder too 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.870
 to do it again and have to 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.549
 Now just select the right profile 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.859
 it is not done yet 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.180
 because like I said there is 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.559
 a few extra commands you enter 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.370
 I also want to have you completely 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.129
 show fast 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.019
 for that I go now in the profiteam 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.379
 you just that again and then we see 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.760
 here 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.859
 I have a forge file or no 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.569
 selected forge version and below 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.189
 there is a lot in it 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.900
 I do not want to go any further 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.099
 to enter what it all means some 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.719
 I do not know things either 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.090
 I just got that from the 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:16.120
 minecraft forum or fine from the opti 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.250
 fried fried also from the topic 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.630
 you can get out there as well 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.400
 manually, otherwise I will write you 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.780
 again in the comments here in front 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.610
 It's just important to me 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.139
 noticed that when I am here for 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.870
 So for example stones excessively is here 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.190
 ge set the title to the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.900
 RAM with the minecraft 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.919
 may work if that is too low 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.160
 it can not be set 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.280
 I'm going to take 3gb because of me 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.810
 I've got sixteen from there, that's fine 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.210
 save the profile and press 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.590
 play and in the forge variant works 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.820
 actually quite clean 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.160
 I never have any problems there 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.479
 so too had forge if that 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.030
 with the installation does not work first 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.590
 times is in the raw state start but otherwise 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.169
 works that we now wait a 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.699
 small moment and then that would have to 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.680
 at least this job will work out 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.169
 There is also the variant that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.599
 easy to install with a click 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.130
 the magic lounge here we see now 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.650
 exactly everything worked out if that is fine 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.669
 something to keep in mind now 1.7 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.470
 Of course I do not want that for you 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.460
 is withheld in the control 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.650
 to look for zoom and sprint 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.150
 lie in the moment on the same button that 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.659
 is because in the 1.7 more 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.820
 Sprint on the let so control in the 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.070
 German introduced the Ctrl left 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.449
 was that maybe put that around 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.710
 For example, you could often take it off 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.900
 I think sometimes simple or 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.030
 let's leave that is okay if you 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.590
 here on public one has it too 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.880
 therefore doubly na has her good good 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.039
 must you has a button created with 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.949
 which is very simple for you to 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.020
 diego drankommt yes that's as far as the 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.550
 installation with deep in forge 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.380
 which definitely worked there 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.630
 I have never had problems in ten of them 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.770
 ten fell completely clean I just got 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.270
 hinted there is still the variant 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.250
 that easily with clicks 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.529
 install violently with the magic lounge 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.969
 now synonymous with the top left 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.259
 video will now be in the next one 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.789
 two days come because I still have 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.289
 but it could be there 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.149
 say oh come today I play with opti 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.829
 I can click celebrate is or 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.139
 I just click out and it is 

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.639
 just not everything in the moz folder 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.469
 is automatically selected but you 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.669
 can then any one and 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.689
 turn off but that comes in the 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.249
 next one two days 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.199
 I think if he sees the video 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.579
 it may already be in there and hope 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.049
 you have fallen so far and helped 

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:22.149
 If so, I would be natural 

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:24.249
 happy about a thumb or an abo 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.839
 so that in the future also current 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.599
 Do not miss tutorials and if you like 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:29.709
 wish you have what we used or mode 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.599
 tutorials just in the comments 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.849
 Write and then I will too 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:37.649
 get ready for you what this 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.649
 I hope now I like the euro
