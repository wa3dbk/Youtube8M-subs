 the grace and peace of the Lord Jesus I am 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.110
 pastor geovane rodrigues 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.210
 We are in the municipality of santa 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.470
 quitéria in the community calls the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.300
 belem where we have a good view base 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.699
 within the belem bag a base 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 missionary program of a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 establishment of churches in isolated areas 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.700
 of the northeastern sortu sertão and we are 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.410
 in this region a year and a half more than one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 a year and a half we arrived here in January 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.399
 of 2012 for church planting 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.399
 in these Hindu communities to communities 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.750
 have no churches and do not have to 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.570
 I do not yet have the preaching of the gospel 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.899
 we are doing this work we have 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.010
 entered we are established in five 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.870
 communities 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.550
 We are now with a few more 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.250
 communities ready for us 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.260
 to advance these communities and from the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.609
 our arrival and before that knowing the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.510
 region 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.210
 we identified the greatest need for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.600
 region that the greatest need is the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.240
 water for drinking water for consumption 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.909
 70% of the soil of the ceará in any 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.670
 place you are going to drill in those 70 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.240
 percent of the water is brackish in the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.460
 2012 was the biggest drought of the last 40 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 years and we are in the year 2013 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.939
 after the period which should have been 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 rainy season 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.670
 this year 2003 was similar to or 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.829
 perhaps worse than the year 2012 then 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.290
 since the beginning of 2012 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.799
 households are being supplied by 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.630
 kite cars and untreated water 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.450
 of a water that also this long 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.790
 magician who have quality and depending 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.240
 the place where you are bringing has 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.619
 bring people diseases sometimes with 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.159
 serious health problems 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.140
 of this water and by virtue of that we 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.610
 we started last year the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.700
 well drilling program 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.650
 construction of these 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.519
 although they are reservoirs that accumulate 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.980
 but rain did not rain and the 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.760
 than the houses they have in their homes 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.489
 are mostly empty or serve 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.390
 to receive this water that comes from 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.230
 cars kites 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.209
 The ideal is drilling wells only 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.390
 Apart from drilling wells with what 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.950
 we did is with the ability to 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.400
 five thousand liters and actually get to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.400
 community service 24 hours they 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.269
 can come and get them now that they 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.299
 they need 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.480
 furthermore we have a need to 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.769
 install equipment to remove the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.319
 salt of the desalinator in this community 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.660
 where we are the site of belem where 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.870
 We intend to install this director. 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 we have this need we need 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.319
 right in this post we 'll be 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.410
 serving between 150 and 200 families of 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:20.329
 directly form families directly 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.730
 with 100% treated water an excellent 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.790
 quality completely removes all 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.940
 salinity of the water this equipment a 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.670
 once installed and the community has 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.639
 then access to the water to drink it 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.410
 is the greatest need with this 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.350
 installation of the equipment to 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.440
 We solve definitively the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.450
 need water to drink to 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.950
 approximately 200 families in a 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:52.819
 direct in that locality 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.660
 the investment in this is of the order of 18 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:00.500
 thousand reais and eighteen thousand reais for us 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.440
 install the equipment because 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.230
 already exists then losing points is already 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.419
 perforated has already one of the boxes 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.489
 necessary then we need the 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:15.739
 building site desalinator 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.489
 in which it will stay warm and also 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.370
 of the installation of pumps and another box 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.830
 because it receives from one of the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.220
 pit boxes 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.110
 then treats and then makes available to 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.189
 another box that is where people have the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.639
 access 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.330
 the investment is in the order of 18 thousand 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.250
 real 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.990
 with this equipment once installed 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.300
 in this well that is already 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.060
 that way we can 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.110
 meet here 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.330
 this is the amount of families that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:55.180
 we already informed so we are 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.310
 working there crying our first 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.400
 function is to pray because we understand that 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.699
 the first is generated in prayer and we 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.250
 we have looked and we are now calling 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.060
 the church calling the Brazilian church 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.639
 church that has understood about the kingdom of 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.659
 God, what is our function as 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.169
 How did the Lord's church come to help us? 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.389
 we know the reality 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.629
 we share with pastors about it 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.449
 that what we see daily is the people 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:31.330
 of this region saying as they said in deeds 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.300
 of the apostles to us and to the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.069
 help pass to us helps us 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.740
 so this is what I want to tell you 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.800
 that the pastor who is a member of a 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.550
 church you want to kingdom servant pass 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.270
 to us and help us because we 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.550
 we understand that this is the will of God 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.599
 not 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:00.339
 I can not imagine what it will be 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:03.520
 someone who heard me was thirsty 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:06.870
 and you did not give me good 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.330
 This causes me dread to imagine it's like this. 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.599
 So god bless you 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.900
 God bless your church and we 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.759
 We are here to serve and pray. 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.039
 us with this region because we 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:24.669
 we are prophesying about this region 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:26.620
 a revival that will transform 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.449
 history of this region 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.750
 the name of the lord jesus god bless 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.750
