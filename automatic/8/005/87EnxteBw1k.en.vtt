and<00:00:40.100> here's<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> need<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and here's how what you need is a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.850 
and here's how what you need is a
paprika<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.940> really<00:00:44.940> sharp<00:00:45.480> knife<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
paprika a really sharp knife and a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
paprika a really sharp knife and a
cutting<00:00:47.039> board<00:00:47.640> first<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> chop

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
cutting board first I'm going to chop

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.760 
cutting board first I'm going to chop
off<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.559> head<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.340> paprika<00:00:51.800> like<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.899 

and<00:00:59.510> then<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.780> remove<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.770> green<00:01:04.909> like

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and then I can remove the green like

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.070 
and then I can remove the green like
this<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> use

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
this this is what we're going to use

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.590 
this this is what we're going to use
this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> use<00:01:14.600> now

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this is what we are not going to use now

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.609 
this is what we are not going to use now
I'm<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> chop<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.189> bottom

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:32.510 

if<00:01:22.619> Walla<00:01:23.990> that's<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> use

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.520 

and<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.560> slice<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:39.659> part<00:01:40.229> of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and now I'm going to slice this part of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.789 
and now I'm going to slice this part of
the<00:01:40.770> paprika<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the paprika and I do this for all the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:53.929 
the paprika and I do this for all the
three<00:01:44.729> sides<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
three sides and as you can see this is

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270 
three sides and as you can see this is
my<00:01:54.090> waist<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
my waist and this is what I'm going to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
my waist and this is what I'm going to
use<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.970> best<00:01:57.240> part<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.929> cutting<00:01:58.830> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
use now the best part of cutting a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.029 
use now the best part of cutting a
paprika<00:01:59.479> like<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.780> you've<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.530> some<00:02:01.770> really

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
paprika like this you've got some really

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.499 
paprika like this you've got some really
cool<00:02:02.600> methods<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:05.060> slicing<00:02:06.060> techniques

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
cool methods for some slicing techniques

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.889 
cool methods for some slicing techniques
for<00:02:07.289> example<00:02:07.459> julienne<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.660> what

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
for example julienne what I'm going what

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.670 
for example julienne what I'm going what
I'm<00:02:09.929> doing<00:02:10.350> now<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:12.390> slice<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.440> paprika

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I'm doing now you slice up the paprika

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.890 
I'm doing now you slice up the paprika
and<00:02:14.959> these<00:02:15.959> size<00:02:16.860> things<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:18.420> call<00:02:18.690> this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and these size things and they call this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.150 
and these size things and they call this
julienne<00:02:19.819> which<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> very<00:02:21.420> cool<00:02:21.840> technique

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
julienne which is a very cool technique

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.150 
julienne which is a very cool technique
used<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.310> salads<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.150> stuff<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.160> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
used for salads and stuff like that so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:44.270 
used for salads and stuff like that so
I'm<00:02:26.220> also<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> do<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.090> this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.680 

and<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:46.470> method<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.220> really<00:02:47.910> useful<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and and this method is really useful to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.070 
and and this method is really useful to
make<00:02:48.900> very<00:02:49.710> accurate<00:02:50.540> nice<00:02:51.860> pública<00:02:52.860> cubes

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
make very accurate nice pública cubes

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.250 
make very accurate nice pública cubes
like<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.320> before<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.780> before<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.990> can

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
like this before you do before you can

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.710 
like this before you do before you can
slice<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.830> cubes<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.490> have<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.570> have

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
slice of cubes you have to have

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.699 
slice of cubes you have to have
juliennes<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.640> you're<00:03:02.850> able<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.709> make

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
juliennes and then you're able to make

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.850 
juliennes and then you're able to make
these<00:03:05.220> careers<00:03:05.850> proof<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> whole<00:03:07.530> pop

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
these careers proof this is a whole pop

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.890 
these careers proof this is a whole pop
account<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.550> here<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.060> what<00:03:09.240> we<00:03:09.270> don't<00:03:09.540> use

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
account and here is what we don't use

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.410 
account and here is what we don't use
this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> waste<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.070> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.550> all<00:03:11.790> we

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
this is the waste and this is all we

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:26.620 
this is the waste and this is all we
have<00:03:12.570> sliced<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.320> nice<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.490> beautiful<00:03:15.120> cubes

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.380 

so<00:03:27.630> from<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.230> day<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.160> hope<00:03:29.550> everybody

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
so from this day on I hope everybody

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.130 
so from this day on I hope everybody
will<00:03:30.600> slap<00:03:30.900> apricots<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.610> way<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.989> we

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
will slap apricots on this way so we

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.040 
will slap apricots on this way so we
reduce<00:03:34.350> waste<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.850> know<00:03:36.090> how<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.510> slice

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
reduce waste and you know how to slice

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.600
