what<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:06.029> probably<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.629> largest<00:00:07.189> hobby

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
what we probably the largest hobby

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.070 
what we probably the largest hobby
robotics<00:00:08.820> manufacturer<00:00:10.969> in<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> world<00:00:12.150> we

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
robotics manufacturer in the world we

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.390 
robotics manufacturer in the world we
sell<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:14.240> all<00:00:15.240> branches<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> military<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
sell to all branches of the military and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.170 
sell to all branches of the military and
not<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.570> our<00:00:18.660> country<00:00:19.430> we<00:00:20.430> sell<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> all

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
not just in our country we sell to all

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.650 
not just in our country we sell to all
the<00:00:21.449> big<00:00:21.600> schools<00:00:21.990> mit<00:00:23.240> probably<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> our

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the big schools mit probably the our

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.630 
the big schools mit probably the our
biggest<00:00:25.080> customers<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:27.779> schools

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
biggest customers are the the schools

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:39.170 
biggest customers are the the schools
and<00:00:29.640> second<00:00:30.679> would<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> hobbyist<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.910> can

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and second would be the hobbyist it can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
and second would be the hobbyist it can
walk<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.899> any<00:00:40.050> directions<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.149> rotate<00:00:49.399> but

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
walk in any directions it can rotate but

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
walk in any directions it can rotate but
this<00:00:50.489> whole<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.449> both<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
this whole thing is it can be both the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.180 
this whole thing is it can be both the
same<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:57.020> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
same time this is where you can put it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.929 
same time this is where you can put it
into<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.520> attack<00:00:59.820> message<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.760> teach

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
into an attack message and we can teach

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.880 
into an attack message and we can teach
it<00:01:05.970> applies

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.760 

and<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:10.540> usually<00:01:10.720> what's<00:01:11.229> called<00:01:11.530> an

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
and it's usually what's called an

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.899 
and it's usually what's called an
alternating<00:01:12.490> tripod<00:01:13.140> case<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.159> what

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
alternating tripod case this is what

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.570 
alternating tripod case this is what
insects<00:01:16.510> use<00:01:16.810> this<00:01:17.229> it's<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.830> most<00:01:18.010> efficient

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
insects use this it's the most efficient

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.640 
insects use this it's the most efficient
way<00:01:18.610> for<00:01:19.470> an<00:01:20.470> insect<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.100> two<00:01:21.729> movies<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.409> this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
way for an insect to two movies so this

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.790 
way for an insect to two movies so this
robot<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.190> basically<00:01:24.810> teaches<00:01:25.810> electronics

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
robot is basically teaches electronics

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
robot is basically teaches electronics
mechanics<00:01:28.110> programming<00:01:29.110> all<00:01:29.950> aspects<00:01:30.640> of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
mechanics programming all aspects of

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.450 
mechanics programming all aspects of
what<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.270> would<00:01:31.360> need<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.930> know<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.770> have<00:01:33.430> a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
what you would need to know to have a

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.749 
what you would need to know to have a
job<00:01:33.759> in<00:01:33.940> industry<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:36.100> pretty<00:01:37.030> cool<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:39.400> idea

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
job in industry it's pretty cool my idea

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.490 
job in industry it's pretty cool my idea
was<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:40.119> make<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.330> little<00:01:40.540> extra<00:01:40.750> cash<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.350> my

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
was to make a little extra cash in my

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.370 
was to make a little extra cash in my
basement<00:01:42.060> honestly<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:45.330> it<00:01:46.330> kind<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.229> took

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
basement honestly and it kind of took

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.760 
basement honestly and it kind of took
off<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.610> sold<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.660> couple<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.990> these<00:01:50.080> to<00:01:50.350> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
off we sold a couple of these to the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.070 
off we sold a couple of these to the
Walt<00:01:50.979> Disney<00:01:51.070> Corporation<00:01:51.490> for<00:01:52.060> use<00:01:52.750> in<00:01:52.990> a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.260 
Walt Disney Corporation for use in a
movie<00:01:53.410> called<00:01:53.619> g-force<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.369> course<00:01:54.970> we<00:01:55.149> don't

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
movie called g-force of course we don't

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.180 
movie called g-force of course we don't
know<00:01:55.509> yet<00:01:55.750> if<00:01:55.929> it's<00:01:56.080> going<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.289> be<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
know yet if it's going to be in the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.080 
know yet if it's going to be in the
movie<00:01:57.520> or<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.060> cutting<00:01:58.990> room<00:01:59.050> floor<00:01:59.410> but

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
movie or on the cutting room floor but

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.460 
movie or on the cutting room floor but
we'll<00:02:01.090> find<00:02:01.240> out<00:02:01.450> soon<00:02:01.720> this<00:02:01.929> summer<00:02:02.140> I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
we'll find out soon this summer I

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.609 
we'll find out soon this summer I
basically<00:02:03.899> build<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.200> make<00:02:05.320> available

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
basically build and make available

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.980 
basically build and make available
things<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.490> think<00:02:06.610> are<00:02:06.880> cool<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.390> there

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
things that I think are cool and there

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.449 
things that I think are cool and there
are<00:02:08.110> other<00:02:08.289> people<00:02:08.679> out<00:02:08.800> there<00:02:09.009> who<00:02:09.190> think

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
are other people out there who think

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.880 
are other people out there who think
they're<00:02:09.610> cool<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.149> it's<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:11.290> great<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.769> is

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
they're cool so it's the great this is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.430 
they're cool so it's the great this is
the<00:02:11.980> best<00:02:12.160> job<00:02:12.280> ever
