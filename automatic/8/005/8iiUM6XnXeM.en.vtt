 Pope 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.590
 good friends of 3 1 point we are here 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 vodafone stand and we are under an antenna 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.710
 lte with htc one hit stars the version 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.940
 in this German case the htc wanis 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.400
 what changes 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 on the shells nothing in the hardware 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.500
 change the processor because we have here 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.570
 a dual core qualcomm and if 4 from 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.260
 really a bit more than the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 tegra 3 to this one and xl complete also 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 the animated background no longer freezes 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.420
 although on tegra 3 they were made by 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.530
 this view of progress 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 however great speed but what 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 I want to show this writing 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.839
 here 4g lte 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.460
 what it means that means that if 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.249
 let's do a speed test there 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 we will realize how also in Italy 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.469
 we wait for the eti and to download e 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.569
 upload to internet file and browse to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.110
 look really fast 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:06.810
 the download heads as much as 77 megabits 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 for second and I will have 25 May ap 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.140
 I must say this, for example, mine 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 video from hooks drop load in a quarter 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.369
 from now instead of the current hour and a half 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 but it also means great speed 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 navigation if we go for example 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.090
 was writing telefonino.net on 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.679
 browser 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.079
 make the bar really charged 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.429
 quickly seen to approve the bread the 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.799
 pin on zoom we know that with his 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.620
 all go very well but I go to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 to load 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.760
 internet pages let's try going up 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:44.460
 courier indeed the republic that it is 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:47.410
 heavy to load republic is here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.720
 we hope there is a desk top model no 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.720
 we insert it immediately ok 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.710
 put the loading speed is 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.909
 really good this case there was a little 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 of time but in my opinion the neck of 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.979
 bottle is not so much the lte it is also 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.390
 from a very fast ping purist but it is the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.270
 republic server that we are there 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.739
 behind the hyper-fast connection of 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.190
 this phone proposed in Germany a 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.709
 699 euros for us poor Italians there 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.730
 all that remains is to wait for 2013 by phone 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.730
