00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.469
 with a strength and speed 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.439
 Endurance is superior to man 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.640
 put these gifts in 1 in a war 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.640
 the du is already involved 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.910

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.390

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.969
 When I met you , I looked 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.719
 in yours and though I am a darkness 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.399
 scale 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.119
 you 're just a monster if you look 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.119
 as once behaved 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.080
 you do not have to force frankenstein 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.720
 God really damn 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.159
 he already has 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.530
 Frankenstein is just under 93 minutes 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.690
 the twelve years released and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.300
 Germany started from the 23rd of January 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.060
 2014 in German cinemas tells the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.710
 history of frankenstein monster dem 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.240
 frankenstein called here played by 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.100
 aaron eckhart who describes like you 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.900
 was once created to be like him 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.670
 but master you have his wife 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.040
 killed for a life for a life 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.990
 take and was hunted until the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.770
 victor frankenstein scientist 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.420
 even for life 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.670
 It came now rather survived the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.710
 frankenstein the centuries and comes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.900
 Protected from now on 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.640
 gargoyles or growing up 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.130
 a world of demons and even gold 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.870
 his world is above or invisible 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.670
 but for mankind there is a quasi-existence 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.500
 the battle between good and evil from 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.810
 fencing and the question for which side 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.340
 will be joined just decide 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.840
 still a kind of demon prince 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.430
 played by Birte the unconditionally 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.710
 to find out how to get this red 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.270
 live or like my name to life 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.280
 Awakening can just find out how it works 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.900
 once victor frankenstein made it 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.220
 and that's the basic story with it 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.020
 it is now about this frankenstein 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.580
 monster with extreme superhuman 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.440
 skills and I have the trailer 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.700
 I must honestly say if 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.989
 that works now, that will be really good 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.270
 what interesting reminds a bit 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.860
 pries and underworld of the look and me 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.570
 have to say I was really positive in the cinema 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.489
 not surprised that the 93rd 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.600
 minutes incredibly entertaining 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.580
 aaron eckhart works here 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.690
 be wonderful opponent too and me 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.209
 I must honestly say that is one 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.459
 blatantly 3d and for genre fans the same 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.840
 to this absolute material battle 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.790
 look like that a little bit if so 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.680
 a little harder to the point is all of us 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.480
 which is a bit too diablo and so 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.070
 starcraft and so are so fireballs 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.989
 All that is seen is thrown 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.040
 really good in 3d the battles 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.270
 are partly really good in scene 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.350
 you are not set either 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.730
 boring and clear 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.230
 you know the story already the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.850
 all the time the film wants to go 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.720
 and now you can not wait for that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.460
 that's a big surprise 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.110
 content is the question is how 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.669
 If you put that around and I have to say that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.160
 the movie is not from the story now 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.990
 the big bringer but to look in the 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.100
 cinema very nice fireworks in which it 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.850
 This is fun on the screen 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.110
 to watch 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.550
 that's why I would say at the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.230
 trailer lust should get that in the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.669
 cinema view all other cologne fingers 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.310
 leave it and say blu ray or 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.570
 dvd is worth it but technically much 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.980
 better than I thought a little 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.480
 Surprise because I thought so 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.160
 It will be a grab in the toilet but was 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.660
 not like that and therefore get from me 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.490
 a frankenstein network really good 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.600
 made horn quotes 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.250
 really scary 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.650
 So action thriller with mystic 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.300
 monster character strong seven and a half 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.440
 of 10 possible points absolutely 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.730
 overall still worth seeing 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.470
 ordinary six out of ten possible 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.590
 score points and that's what I'm through with 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.060
 binary to franckenstein that can do one 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.380
 thumb to let this review done 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.640
 it will stay if i am otherwise here 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.770
