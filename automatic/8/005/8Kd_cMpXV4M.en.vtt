have the like or 0 X out of the package

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.110 
have the like or 0 X out of the package
but<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:40.500> assembled<00:02:40.950> yet<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:41.910> wanted

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
but not assembled yet so I just wanted

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.229 
but not assembled yet so I just wanted
to<00:02:42.180> show<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> some<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.519> parts<00:02:44.519> before

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
to show you some of the parts before

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.020 
to show you some of the parts before
assembly<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.190> was<00:02:47.190> quite<00:02:47.400> surprised

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
assembly and that was quite surprised

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.780 
assembly and that was quite surprised
when<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.420> helped<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:50.250> did<00:02:50.489> not<00:02:50.519> expect

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
when I helped in this and did not expect

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.860 
when I helped in this and did not expect
to<00:02:51.060> see<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.480> many<00:02:51.690> plastic<00:02:52.380> sprues<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
to see so many plastic sprues the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500 
to see so many plastic sprues the
previous<00:02:54.870> two<00:02:55.079> Zoids<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.560> built<00:02:55.829> had<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.510> had

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
previous two Zoids I built had a had

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
previous two Zoids I built had a had
three<00:02:57.870> sprues<00:02:58.170> at<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.440> most<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.430> this<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
three sprues at the most and this like a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.940 
three sprues at the most and this like a
0x<00:03:02.130> has<00:03:02.400> about<00:03:02.760> 20<00:03:03.239> sprues<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.900> twelve<00:03:04.829> of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
0x has about 20 sprues and twelve of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.759 
0x has about 20 sprues and twelve of
which<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> base<00:03:05.970> unit<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.170> rest<00:03:07.410> are

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
which are the base unit and the rest are

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.729 
which are the base unit and the rest are
the<00:03:08.040> armor<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.700> weapon<00:03:09.090> attachments<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> I

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
the armor and weapon attachments so I

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.379 
the armor and weapon attachments so I
know<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.549> by<00:03:13.160> between<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.489> video<00:03:14.970> this

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
know that by between this video this

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.420 
know that by between this video this
part<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> video<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.709> next<00:03:16.889> section

part of the video and the next section

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.190 
part of the video and the next section
of<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.639> video<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.209> assembled<00:03:18.600> Zoid<00:03:18.900> it's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
of the video the assembled Zoid it's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.520 
of the video the assembled Zoid it's
gonna<00:03:19.319> be<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:20.600> bit<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.780> time<00:03:21.989> gap<00:03:22.230> because

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
gonna be a bit of a time gap because

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.910 
gonna be a bit of a time gap because
this<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.130> gonna<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.549> project<00:03:23.819> for<00:03:24.060> me

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
this is gonna be a little project for me

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.039 
this is gonna be a little project for me
looking<00:03:25.920> at<00:03:26.069> some<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.430> items<00:03:26.609> here<00:03:27.049> you

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
looking at some of the items here you

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.759 
looking at some of the items here you
can<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.410> here<00:03:28.680> here's<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.220> motor<00:03:30.000> unit<00:03:30.769> you

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
can see here here's the motor unit you

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.759 
can see here here's the motor unit you
can<00:03:31.920> see<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.579> pretty<00:03:32.790> complicated

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
can see here it's pretty complicated

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.129 
can see here it's pretty complicated
compared<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.220> windup<00:03:36.180> Zoids<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.989> see

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
compared to the windup Zoids you can see

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.390 
compared to the windup Zoids you can see
all<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.590> gears<00:03:38.130> inside<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:39.750> rather<00:03:40.590> pretty

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
all the gears inside it's rather pretty

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.240 
all the gears inside it's rather pretty
neat<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> piece<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.510> machinery<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:44.040> this

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
neat a piece of machinery here and this

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.539 
neat a piece of machinery here and this
is<00:03:44.400> where<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.639> battery<00:03:45.000> goes<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:46.319> here's<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
is where the battery goes and here's the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.360 
is where the battery goes and here's the
manual<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.630> about<00:03:48.900> 38<00:03:49.410> pages<00:03:49.650> long<00:03:50.040> so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
manual and it's about 38 pages long so

it's pretty extensive and when I read on
the<00:03:53.220> web<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:54.510> particular<00:03:54.840> sword<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.349> about

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the web this particular sword is about

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.379 
the web this particular sword is about
mineral<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> road<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.579> can<00:03:56.849> only<00:03:57.090> imagine

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389
