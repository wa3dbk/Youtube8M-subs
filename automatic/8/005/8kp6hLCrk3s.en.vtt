00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.170
 Good thing is that smell is more it is everything 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.500

 heard their stories grew up reading the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.820
 The story happened before 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.159
 of him coming to earth and throughout my 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.950
 I walked by and I recognized what 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.900
 it was not just history it was true i 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.120
 I was pleased to see and act 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.130
 my life in little little things 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.640
 details and it has become my best 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 Friend is my teacher, my son, have 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.620
 taught many things and when I think 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.720

 purpose all magic for life is him 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.070
 that puts it as if we are the password and we 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.730
 we are a black and white screen 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.490
 When he enters it brings the color 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.850
 he brings the air he brings joy he brings 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.190
 both the fifth question is what 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.680
 verse, please convince as always 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.570
 It stirred me a lot in Psalms 17 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.810
 Hi verse that says so 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.880
 protect me like the girl from your eyes 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.459
 hide me in the shade of your wings good 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.590
 It's 110 very little 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.270
 I read this verse and it always stirred 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.690
 much with me because every time I went 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.390
 there I imagined before God and I saw him 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.830
 mine and I saw my reflection in the eyes 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.840
 That's how I always have it. 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.030
 imagined as a girl because God is 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.239
 so big I'm so little people 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.190
 of his grace and it comforts me to know 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.590
 that he is always protecting me 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.410
 eyes are very delicate region of ours. 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.959
 body that needs extreme protection and 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.239
 it 's ours when we say sir 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.989
 Protect me like a girl from your eyes. 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.430
 it puts us in its most sacred place 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.230
 the image of a human body that we 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.600
 we have a very sacred place in a place 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.120
 which deserves much of a challenge and this 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.250
 This part makes us feel special and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.910
 likes to feel saved felt 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.910
 protected 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.459
 God protects us a little girl then 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.140
 Sixth question is your favorite song. 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.330
 Good, I'm that kind of person who goes 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.330
 collecting much the world loves 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.100
 collect music book it all thing 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.970

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.090
 memory 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.190
 so I have several favorite songs 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 one of them is me and girl is not going 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.709

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.660

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.000
 humid vettel news 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.010
 Well this song speaks, it's like God. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.700
 candace her to you and he says he 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.849
 He wants to be everything to you because he is everything. 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.190
 he says in the song that he is at his 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.560
 front is protecting you deliberately from 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.580
 everything is bad and its wide that you 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.040
 says khan 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.660
 it is your only do you not rest 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.000
 It's like a song, it 's cuter because 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.160
 these if you have not heard or if I have 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.220
 I'm sure you'll fall in love with 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.090
 seventh question is a band singer the group 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.520
 favorite 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.120
 good to marcela country is one of my 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.130
 Favorite singers are double has uses rays 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.500
 that I'm completely in love 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.800
 I'm in love with several groups too. 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.660
 You do not like international music. 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.660
 what a collection 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.190
 I really like listening to Christian songs. 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.470
 more than music being clear I like 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.030
 of very few secular songs and I 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.190
 I think I think not always 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.260
 see good things so there are several of me 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.229
 several groups of singers that I 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.630
 I really admire that I am always there. 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.430
 eighth question is jones has slipped already 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.650
 gained some soul for Jesus 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.200
 good already have your body through 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.300
 theater groups choreography group and 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.370
 I think he is also in his 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.310
 worshipers both the fan page as boy 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.900
 I consider it an evangelism and I 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.030
 I do not know if I gave my brother because 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.710
 No one ever tells me I said until I went 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.900
 transformed your cause 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.700
 but I do not think it matters that I know if 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.190
 through my life not some soul 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.720
 consulting jesus I know is the least 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.680
 matter the important thing is that this is 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.270
 happening 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.210
 it is important that through a text 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.979
 through a photo to people feel 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.229
 that need to be re-approximated if 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.020
 approach for the first time and that 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.430
 this pan and that this is happening 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.830
 may god keep an eye on it and that's the 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.270
 More important here is not important for me 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.270
 to know so it is already happening 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.740
 The standard question is, have you read the Bible? 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.039
 Unfortunately, I have not read the Bible yet. 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.469
 all but much of the books and it is 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.379
 a purpose to read her everything I need 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:58.389
 to do that I'm going to work this year at 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.520
 tenth question is do you believe in 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.379
 evangelize through the internet of course 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.419
 that I have said today only through 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.999
 internet because the price of worshipers 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.949
 nothing else is that this is a portal where 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.929
 we have evangelized we have 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.809
 carried the message we have taken the 

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:15.459
 Christ's love there are many hearts we 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:18.339
 we have received return says it always has 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:20.289
 a princess who comes to say that she felt 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.969
 well on the page you feel a presence of 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.819
 This design is very important and 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:27.459
 I really believe in this evangelism. 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.419
 and I intend to do and many many many 

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.550
 years 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.909
 The last tec question for you to 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.009

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.369

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:55.719

 has helped to do several studies in 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.369
 On top of this, I've been taught to
