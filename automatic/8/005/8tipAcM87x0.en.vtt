00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
does seem sort of like teleportation
since<00:01:42.270> she<00:01:42.450> made<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> entire<00:01:43.229> island<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:44.460> away

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
since she made the entire island go away

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.609 
since she made the entire island go away
besides<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> peace<00:01:45.780> she<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:46.110> standing<00:01:46.320> on

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
besides the peace she was standing on

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.190 
besides the peace she was standing on
which<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> fucking<00:01:47.549> epic<00:01:47.790> scene<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.630> cannot

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
which was a fucking epic scene I cannot

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
which was a fucking epic scene I cannot
wait<00:01:49.530> until<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.250> gets<00:01:50.369> animated<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.390> just

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
wait until that gets animated but just

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
wait until that gets animated but just
the<00:01:51.689> fact<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.930> she<00:01:52.020> come<00:01:52.350> distorted<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the fact that she come distorted the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.730 
the fact that she come distorted the
shape<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.610> island<00:01:54.000> first<00:01:54.270> kind<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.140> leaves

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
shape of the island first kind of leaves

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.819 
shape of the island first kind of leaves
me<00:01:56.009> towards<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.060> side<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> her<00:01:57.750> magic<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
me towards the side that her magic is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.399 
me towards the side that her magic is
kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> spacetime<00:02:00.509> manipulation

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
kind of like a spacetime manipulation

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.499 
kind of like a spacetime manipulation
kind<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.710> thing<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.280> God<00:02:02.579> Serena<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
kind of thing and if God Serena is the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.499 
kind of thing and if God Serena is the
most<00:02:03.719> badass<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.860> 12<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.969> cannot

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
most badass of all 12 of them I cannot

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
most badass of all 12 of them I cannot
wait<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.439> he<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:07.890> she

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
wait to see what he or she

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.349 
wait to see what he or she
man<00:02:09.379> god<00:02:10.379> Serena<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:11.099> literally<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.939> to<00:02:12.090> be

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.359 
man god Serena is literally going to be

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.660 
man god Serena is literally going to be
the<00:02:12.599> god<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.079> show<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:13.950> Knox<00:02:14.400> was

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the god of the show and I think Knox was

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.190 
the god of the show and I think Knox was
going<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.329> pull<00:02:15.510> out<00:02:15.540> his<00:02:15.750> dragon

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
going to have to pull out his dragon

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.020 
going to have to pull out his dragon

eyes form for those of you that don't

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.089 
eyes form for those of you that don't
know<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:18.359> it<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.629> there's<00:02:19.079> a<00:02:19.170> movie<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.980> was

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
know what it is there's a movie that was

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.190 
know what it is there's a movie that was
announced<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.000> showed<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.510> picture<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
announced and it showed a picture of

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.190 
announced and it showed a picture of
Natsu<00:02:23.189> like<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.670> his<00:02:23.790> normal<00:02:24.150> size<00:02:24.299> being<00:02:24.840> half

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
Natsu like in his normal size being half

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.470 
Natsu like in his normal size being half
dragon<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.829> he<00:02:25.950> had<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> dragon<00:02:26.519> wing<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> red

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
dragon like he had a dragon wing and red

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
dragon like he had a dragon wing and red
dragon<00:02:27.870> scales<00:02:28.139> on<00:02:28.349> half<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.769> his<00:02:28.950> face<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.670> I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
dragon scales on half of his face so I

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.879 
dragon scales on half of his face so I
think<00:02:29.969> he's<00:02:30.420> able<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.469> now<00:02:31.859> because

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
think he's able to do that now because

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.069 
think he's able to do that now because
of<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.879> know<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.030> time<00:02:33.359> skipper<00:02:33.689> whatever

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
of you know the time skipper whatever

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.869 
of you know the time skipper whatever
but<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.829> he's<00:02:34.950> going<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.250> pull<00:02:35.639> it<00:02:35.760> out

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
but I think he's going to pull it out

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.970 
but I think he's going to pull it out
like<00:02:36.299> when<00:02:36.629> things<00:02:37.019> get<00:02:37.319> really<00:02:37.680> really

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
like when things get really really

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.220 
like when things get really really
serious<00:02:38.489> hopefully<00:02:39.239> he<00:02:39.420> does<00:02:39.659> because<00:02:40.019> I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
serious hopefully he does because I

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.849 
serious hopefully he does because I
right<00:02:41.159> now<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> cannot<00:02:41.879> see<00:02:42.239> Natsu<00:02:43.230> taking<00:02:43.709> her

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.000 
but I thought he was like on the mission
but<00:03:29.849> now<00:03:29.939> he's<00:03:30.150> chilling<00:03:30.599> back<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.439> hot
