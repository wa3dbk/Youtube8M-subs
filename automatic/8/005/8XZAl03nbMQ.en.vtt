on video in this video I'll be showing
you<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.910> drive<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.299> guitar<00:00:06.930> body<00:00:07.170> shape

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
you how to drive this guitar body shape

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.190 
you how to drive this guitar body shape
i'll<00:00:08.700> be<00:00:08.820> doing<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> demonstrate<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.900> few

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
i'll be doing that to demonstrate a few

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.190 
i'll be doing that to demonstrate a few
tips<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> tricks<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.330> circles<00:00:12.330> arcs<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
tips and tricks on circles arcs and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.310 
tips and tricks on circles arcs and
snapping<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.160> their<00:00:14.309> tangents<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:16.170> i'll<00:00:16.230> be

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
snapping to their tangents so i'll be

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.140 
snapping to their tangents so i'll be
doing<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.010> Freak<00:00:17.490> ad-free<00:00:18.090> version

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
doing this in the Freak ad-free version

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.750 
doing this in the Freak ad-free version
of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> cad<00:00:18.900> program<00:00:19.080> double<00:00:19.680> cab<00:00:19.890> xt<00:00:20.520> which

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760

you can download from double cab com so
to<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.350> started<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.859> i'm<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
to get started with i'm just going to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.000 
to get started with i'm just going to
draw<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.000> rectangle<00:00:27.990> which<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
draw a rectangle which is the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
draw a rectangle which is the
approximate<00:00:29.609> overall<00:00:30.119> size<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:31.050> guitar

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
approximate overall size of my guitar

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
approximate overall size of my guitar
border<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.099> i'm<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> draw<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.759> using

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
border so i'm going to draw this using

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.660 
border so i'm going to draw this using
relative<00:00:33.540> coordinates<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.430> I'm<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
relative coordinates and I'm going to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.840 
relative coordinates and I'm going to
make<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.170> 13<00:00:37.170> 65<00:00:37.860> millimeters<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> X

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
make this 13 65 millimeters in the X

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
make this 13 65 millimeters in the X
direction<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:40.440> 80<00:00:40.680> millimeters<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
direction and for 80 millimeters in the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.110 
direction and for 80 millimeters in the
Y<00:00:41.760> direction<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> will<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> overall

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
Y direction so that will be the overall

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
Y direction so that will be the overall
size<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> draw<00:00:46.410> half<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
size now I'm going to draw half of the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
size now I'm going to draw half of the
guitar<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.610> mirror<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
guitar and then mirror so I'm going to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
guitar and then mirror so I'm going to
draw<00:00:49.110> another<00:00:49.379> line<00:00:49.700> vertically<00:00:50.700> through<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
draw another line vertically through the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
draw another line vertically through the
center<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.449> Fox<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.800> hence<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> trim

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
center of that Fox and then hence a trim

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.049 
center of that Fox and then hence a trim
command<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.270> cut<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> side<00:00:55.820> now<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> can

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
command to cut off that side now you can

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.900 
command to cut off that side now you can
see<00:00:57.300> there's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> difference<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.070> our<00:00:59.430> fathers

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
see there's a difference in our fathers

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
see there's a difference in our fathers
kurz<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.899> speak<00:01:01.199> after<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> guitar

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
kurz actually speak after the guitar

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
kurz actually speak after the guitar
body<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> machine<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.359> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
body so I'm going to machine that this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.550 
body so I'm going to machine that this
top<00:01:04.439> part<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.479> 270<00:01:06.479> millimeters<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
top part here is 270 millimeters one and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.250 
top part here is 270 millimeters one and
the<00:01:07.650> bottom<00:01:07.950> part<00:01:08.210> will<00:01:09.210> say<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:10.070> 360<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> I'm

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the bottom part will say is 360 so I'm

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160 
the bottom part will say is 360 so I'm
going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> draw<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> line<00:01:14.750> just<00:01:15.750> sort<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> an

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
going to draw a line just sort of an

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.039 
going to draw a line just sort of an
arbitrary<00:01:16.680> length<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> top<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.049> I'm

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
arbitrary length from the top and I'm

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859 
arbitrary length from the top and I'm
going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> move<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> length

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
going to move it out and into the length

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.149 
going to move it out and into the length
box<00:01:22.229> i'm<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> type<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.700> 70

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
box i'm actually going to type in to 70

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.050 
box i'm actually going to type in to 70
/<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.799> double<00:01:28.799> cabin<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> calculation

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
/ to a double cabin do the calculation

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.050 
/ to a double cabin do the calculation
on<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> draw<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> line<00:01:31.110> half<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.280> 270

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
on that and draw this line half of 270

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.440 
on that and draw this line half of 270
so<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> says<00:01:33.810> maybe<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.350> math<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.030> start

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so that says maybe the math so you start

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
so that says maybe the math so you start
drawing<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.250> curve<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.549> we'll<00:01:41.670> start<00:01:41.939> with

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
drawing the curve so we'll start with

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
drawing the curve so we'll start with
this<00:01:42.270> top<00:01:42.600> curve<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.990> before<00:01:46.200> i

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
this top curve up here just before i

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.109 
this top curve up here just before i
draw<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> first<00:01:47.189> arc<00:01:47.460> i'm<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:47.820> going

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
draw this first arc i'm actually going

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.960 
draw this first arc i'm actually going
to<00:01:48.210> draw<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> line<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.049> vertical<00:01:49.530> line<00:01:49.790> just<00:01:50.790> from

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to draw a line a vertical line just from

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.880 
to draw a line a vertical line just from
the<00:01:51.119> end<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> line<00:01:51.780> we've<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.290> drawn<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the end of that line we've just drawn so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
the end of that line we've just drawn so
this<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.189> give<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.610> tangent<00:01:54.119> lines<00:01:54.360> for

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this will give you my tangent lines for

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
this will give you my tangent lines for
this<00:01:54.840> first<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> i'm<00:01:56.909> actually<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this first up so i'm actually going to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.060 
this first up so i'm actually going to
draw<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> circle<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.680> trim<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> down

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
draw this as a circle and trim it down

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
draw this as a circle and trim it down
later<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.790> because<00:01:59.939> i<00:02:00.030> find<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> bit

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
later just because i find you get a bit

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620 
later just because i find you get a bit
more<00:02:00.960> control<00:02:01.380> using<00:02:02.159> circles<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
more control using circles so we go to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
more control using circles so we go to
the<00:02:03.990> circle<00:02:04.500> tool<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> left<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> click

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the circle tool on the left and click

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
the circle tool on the left and click
the<00:02:05.969> mouse<00:02:06.149> button<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.659> hold<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> down<00:02:07.170> then

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the mouse button and hold it down then

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.219 
the mouse button and hold it down then
let<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.849> all<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.660> options<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
let it go we get all of the options of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.559 
let it go we get all of the options of
drawing<00:02:10.470> circles<00:02:10.879> so<00:02:11.879> we'll<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.180> using<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
drawing circles so we'll be using the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.640 
drawing circles so we'll be using the
ones<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.050> tangi

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
ones with the tangi

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
ones with the tangi
snaps<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.939> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.150> see<00:02:15.299> there's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> couple<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
snaps so you can see there's a couple of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
snaps so you can see there's a couple of
different<00:02:16.200> options<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.590> start<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.549> all

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
different options here start with all

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.890 
different options here start with all
use<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.150> tan<00:02:18.599> tan<00:02:19.049> radius<00:02:19.620> circle<00:02:20.329> so<00:02:21.329> this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
use the tan tan radius circle so this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.399 
use the tan tan radius circle so this
one<00:02:22.170> here<00:02:22.439> you<00:02:22.680> pick<00:02:22.890> two<00:02:23.189> lines<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:25.049> which<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
one here you pick two lines to which the

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.319 
one here you pick two lines to which the
circle<00:02:25.829> be<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> tangent<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.909> type<00:02:27.150> in

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
circle be a tangent and then you type in

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.530 
circle be a tangent and then you type in
their<00:02:27.420> ideas<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.920> first<00:02:29.819> line<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.329> be<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
their ideas so first line will be this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.929 
their ideas so first line will be this
vertical<00:02:31.079> one<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.220> second<00:02:32.609> line<00:02:32.760> will

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
vertical one then the second line will

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.839 
vertical one then the second line will
be<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.120> top<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.769> see<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.069> snap<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
be this top so you can see that snap the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.330 
be this top so you can see that snap the
circle<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.359> those<00:02:36.510> two<00:02:36.780> tangents<00:02:37.560> now<00:02:38.250> I'm

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
circle to those two tangents now I'm

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.390 
circle to those two tangents now I'm
going<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.549> make<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.939> circle<00:02:39.980> ste<00:02:40.980> 100

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
going to make this circle ste 100

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030 
going to make this circle ste 100
millimeters<00:02:41.909> radius<00:02:42.359> so<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.470> gives<00:02:43.650> us<00:02:43.799> our

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
millimeters radius so that gives us our

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.360 
millimeters radius so that gives us our
first<00:02:44.340> corner<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.859> I'm<00:02:46.859> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.129> repeat

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
first corner there I'm going to repeat

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.970 
first corner there I'm going to repeat
the<00:02:47.549> same<00:02:47.790> process<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.629> bottom<00:02:48.980> so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the same process with the bottom so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.119 
the same process with the bottom so
isn't<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.430> same<00:02:51.049> type<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.079> circle<00:02:52.650> 10<00:02:52.859> 10

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
isn't the same type of circle 10 10

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.970 
isn't the same type of circle 10 10
ratings<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.670> reviews<00:02:53.760> bottom<00:02:54.329> line<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:55.319> its

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
ratings and reviews bottom line and its

ratings and reviews bottom line and its
vertical<00:02:56.400> line<00:02:56.659> now<00:02:57.659> this<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.139> be<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
vertical line now this is going to be a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.160 
vertical line now this is going to be a
bit<00:02:58.439> of<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> bigger<00:02:58.799> circle<00:02:59.099> so<00:02:59.519> I'll<00:02:59.609> make<00:02:59.790> it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
bit of a bigger circle so I'll make it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.660 
bit of a bigger circle so I'll make it
155<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.459> gives<00:03:02.609> us<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:04.159> surface<00:03:05.159> bear

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.280 

ok<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.209> little<00:03:09.540> infield<00:03:10.109> curve

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
ok so to do this little infield curve

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.629 
ok so to do this little infield curve
we've<00:03:10.500> got<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> couple<00:03:10.859> of<00:03:11.069> options<00:03:11.280> we<00:03:11.609> can

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
we've got a couple of options we can

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.990 
we've got a couple of options we can
draw<00:03:11.909> another<00:03:12.180> circle<00:03:12.540> using<00:03:12.989> tan-tan<00:03:14.000> radius

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
draw another circle using tan-tan radius

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.179 
draw another circle using tan-tan radius
or<00:03:15.569> we<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.409> look<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.980> arc

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
or we can have a look at some of the arc

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.159 
or we can have a look at some of the arc
options<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.389> I'm<00:03:18.449> going<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.660> go<00:03:18.750> click<00:03:18.989> and

see<00:03:21.569> there's<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.870> bunch<00:03:22.109> of<00:03:22.290> options<00:03:22.500> under<00:03:22.949> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
see there's a bunch of options under the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.080 
see there's a bunch of options under the
arc<00:03:24.079> what<00:03:25.079> we<00:03:25.230> want<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:25.859> here<00:03:25.889> is<00:03:26.609> an<00:03:26.849> arc

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
arc what we want to do here is an arc

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.020 
arc what we want to do here is an arc
tangent<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.650> two<00:03:28.859> entities<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:29.819> going<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
tangent to two entities so I'm going to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.589 
tangent to two entities so I'm going to
click<00:03:30.180> back<00:03:30.389> tattoo<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.609> put<00:03:32.609> my<00:03:32.760> first<00:03:33.000> circle

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
click back tattoo to put my first circle

click back tattoo to put my first circle
click<00:03:34.109> my<00:03:34.230> second<00:03:34.680> circle<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.680> quick<00:03:37.680> to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
click my second circle and quick to

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.220 
click my second circle and quick to
define<00:03:38.370> my<00:03:38.579> radius<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.449> after<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.810> quick<00:03:40.049> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
define my radius now after a quick it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.259 
define my radius now after a quick it
asked<00:03:40.409> me<00:03:40.590> which<00:03:40.739> side<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.370> arc<00:03:41.639> on<00:03:41.879> a<00:03:42.000> drop

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
asked me which side of the arc on a drop

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.699 
asked me which side of the arc on a drop
so<00:03:42.599> I'm<00:03:42.659> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.870> click<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.290> right-hand

so I'm going to click on the right-hand

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.420 
so I'm going to click on the right-hand
side<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.370> into<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:46.739> i<00:03:46.919> can<00:03:47.069> use

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
side to get into it so now i can use

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.949 
side to get into it so now i can use
this<00:03:47.459> for<00:03:47.849> lack<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.479> the<00:03:48.780> trim<00:03:49.049> command<00:03:49.079> and

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
this for lack of the trim command and

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.530 
this for lack of the trim command and
the<00:03:53.599> rectangular<00:03:54.599> drew<00:03:54.840> originally<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:56.540> get

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the rectangular drew originally to get

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.439 
the rectangular drew originally to get
rid<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.319> other<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:59.190> darkness<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.060> parts

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
rid of the other the darkness so parts

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.649 
rid of the other the darkness so parts
of<00:04:00.569> those<00:04:00.720> surface<00:04:02.090> delete<00:04:03.090> guidelines

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
of those surface delete guidelines

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.710 
of those surface delete guidelines
you're<00:04:04.109> left<00:04:04.319> with<00:04:04.729> one<00:04:05.729> half<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.359> guitar

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you're left with one half of a guitar

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.369 
you're left with one half of a guitar
shape<00:04:07.079> now<00:04:08.040> I'm<00:04:08.190> not<00:04:08.340> really<00:04:08.810> digging<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.229> way

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
shape now I'm not really digging the way

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.170 
shape now I'm not really digging the way
this<00:04:10.590> curves<00:04:11.010> around<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.760> what<00:04:11.909> I<00:04:11.940> want<00:04:12.120> to

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
this curves around so what I want to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.469 
this curves around so what I want to
actually<00:04:12.329> do<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:13.250> go<00:04:14.250> back<00:04:14.370> over<00:04:14.699> to<00:04:14.760> my<00:04:14.819> circle

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
actually do is go back over to my circle

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.319 
actually do is go back over to my circle
and<00:04:16.130> I'm<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.310> going<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.549> draw<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.820> circle

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
and I'm just going to draw a circle

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.610 
and I'm just going to draw a circle
at<00:04:19.840> about<00:04:20.259> 40<00:04:21.159> milliliters<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:22.349> I'm<00:04:23.349> going<00:04:23.560> to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
at about 40 milliliters and I'm going to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.059 
at about 40 milliliters and I'm going to
move<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:25.319> just<00:04:26.319> somewhere<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.580> in<00:04:27.969> here<00:04:28.300> just

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
move it just somewhere in in here just

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.469 
move it just somewhere in in here just
so<00:04:30.069> it's<00:04:30.219> not<00:04:30.340> quite<00:04:30.639> touching<00:04:30.939> those<00:04:31.210> two

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
so it's not quite touching those two

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.990 
so it's not quite touching those two
kids<00:04:31.810> I'm<00:04:32.590> going<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.800> draw<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.069> line<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.699> runs

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
kids I'm going to draw a line that runs

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.820 
kids I'm going to draw a line that runs
from<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.360> tangent<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.139> curve<00:04:35.469> to<00:04:35.740> the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
for the tender here to eat a bit here so

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240 
for the tender here to eat a bit here so
if<00:04:40.780> i<00:04:40.840> go<00:04:40.870> over<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.259> line<00:04:41.469> tool<00:04:41.830> click<00:04:42.069> and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
if i go over the line tool click and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.589 
if i go over the line tool click and
hold<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.849> get<00:04:43.419> line<00:04:43.740> tangent<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:45.039> ucks<00:04:45.449> keep<00:04:46.449> my

first duck second up and repeat that

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.309 
first duck second up and repeat that
command<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:52.090> that's<00:04:52.270> given<00:04:52.599> me<00:04:52.629> alive<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.020> i

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
command so that's given me alive and i

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.230 
command so that's given me alive and i
shouldna<00:04:53.560> tangent<00:04:54.159> so<00:04:54.310> I<00:04:54.340> can<00:04:54.520> use<00:04:54.669> those<00:04:54.699> two

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
shouldna tangent so I can use those two

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.529 
shouldna tangent so I can use those two
lines<00:04:55.449> of<00:04:55.750> just<00:04:55.990> drawn<00:04:56.289> and<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.969> trim<00:04:57.969> command

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.330 

to<00:05:01.539> trim<00:05:01.930> all<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.169> unnecessary<00:05:02.469> line<00:05:03.069> work

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
to trim all the unnecessary line work

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.070 
to trim all the unnecessary line work
and<00:05:05.099> now<00:05:06.099> I<00:05:06.430> will<00:05:06.520> trim<00:05:07.150> again<00:05:07.449> using<00:05:08.050> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
and now I will trim again using the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.920 
and now I will trim again using the
darks<00:05:08.710> get<00:05:09.460> rid<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.849> rectangle<00:05:10.840> shape<00:05:11.080> and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
darks get rid of the rectangle shape and

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.689 
darks get rid of the rectangle shape and
now<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:13.960> want<00:05:14.199> to<00:05:14.259> mirror<00:05:14.529> this<00:05:14.800> shape<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.490> those

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
now I want to mirror this shape of those

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.249 
now I want to mirror this shape of those
so<00:05:15.909> I<00:05:15.940> before<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.330> do<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:16.569> I'm<00:05:16.840> going<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.050> turn

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
so I before I do that I'm going to turn

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.140 
so I before I do that I'm going to turn
this<00:05:17.469> into<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:17.860> pole<00:05:18.099> line<00:05:18.370> sobered<00:05:18.819> up<00:05:18.939> to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
this into a pole line sobered up to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.839 
this into a pole line sobered up to
modify<00:05:19.689> and<00:05:20.370> join<00:05:21.370> polyline<00:05:21.939> I<00:05:22.210> can<00:05:22.539> click<00:05:23.849> all

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
modify and join polyline I can click all

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.659 
modify and join polyline I can click all
the<00:05:25.060> elements<00:05:25.300> around<00:05:25.750> my<00:05:25.960> shape<00:05:28.919> and<00:05:29.919> then

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
the elements around my shape and then

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.459 
the elements around my shape and then
down<00:05:31.150> in<00:05:31.330> my<00:05:31.419> command<00:05:31.719> line<00:05:32.020> i'm<00:05:32.199> going<00:05:32.379> to

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
down in my command line i'm going to

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.899 
down in my command line i'm going to
type<00:05:32.650> in<00:05:32.710> yep<00:05:34.229> j/p<00:05:35.229> they<00:05:36.039> can<00:05:36.250> see<00:05:36.460> here<00:05:36.789> you've

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
type in yep j/p they can see here you've

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.089 
type in yep j/p they can see here you've
got<00:05:36.940> all<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.270> options<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:38.020> capital<00:05:38.560> letters

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
got all the options the capital letters

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.809 
got all the options the capital letters
in<00:05:39.370> your<00:05:39.490> options<00:05:40.229> are<00:05:41.229> shortcuts<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.400> if<00:05:42.669> you

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
in your options are shortcuts so if you

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.369 
in your options are shortcuts so if you
want<00:05:42.969> to<00:05:43.029> do<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.240> one<00:05:43.449> step<00:05:43.750> back<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.139> just

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
want to do the one step back you just

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:50.540 
want to do the one step back you just
type<00:05:44.589> in<00:05:44.770> osb<00:05:45.460> or<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:47.020> finish<00:05:47.379> you<00:05:47.560> type<00:05:47.770> in<00:05:47.979> FJP

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
type in osb or to finish you type in FJP

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.579 
type in osb or to finish you type in FJP
so<00:05:51.550> that<00:05:51.819> turn<00:05:52.150> those<00:05:52.389> into<00:05:52.599> one<00:05:52.900> object<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.529> I

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:53.589 
so that turn those into one object and I

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.459 
so that turn those into one object and I
through<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.979> mirror<00:05:54.250> command<00:05:55.229> good<00:05:56.229> days

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
through the mirror command good days

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.519 
through the mirror command good days
around<00:05:56.710> I<00:05:57.449> believe<00:05:58.449> that<00:05:58.599> central<00:05:59.050> line<00:05:59.229> and

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
around I believe that central line and

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.409 
around I believe that central line and
there<00:06:00.159> you<00:06:00.219> go<00:06:00.400> that's<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.729> outline<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:01.180> you

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
there you go that's the outline of you

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.140 
there you go that's the outline of you
