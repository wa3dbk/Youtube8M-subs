lanyard this would be the I think this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.830

is from when I went to Bay Hill this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.860 
is from when I went to Bay Hill this
year<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.410> had<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> pass<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
year and this had a pass on it and I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
year and this had a pass on it and I
actually<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.289> hooked<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.590> paperclip<00:00:47.100> cut<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
actually just hooked a paperclip cut a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
actually just hooked a paperclip cut a
couple<00:00:47.610> holes<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> tennis<00:00:48.329> ball<00:00:48.510> hooked<00:00:48.690> a

paperclip through there and a rubber

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.410 
paperclip through there and a rubber

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
band so it's actually a little bit

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
band so it's actually a little bit
stretchy<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> adapt<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> the

distance<00:00:54.059> make<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.449> longer<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
distance make it a little longer or

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
distance make it a little longer or
shorter<00:00:55.320> depending<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.640> how<00:00:56.730> you

one<00:01:18.180> thing<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.509> I've<00:01:18.570> noticed<00:01:18.720> when<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> first

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
one thing that I've noticed when I first

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.480 
one thing that I've noticed when I first
started<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:19.979> drill<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.250> I've<00:01:20.369> seen

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
started to do this drill and I've seen

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.910 
started to do this drill and I've seen
other<00:01:20.670> people<00:01:20.729> try<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.390> drill<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.920> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
other people try to do this drill is you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
other people try to do this drill is you
want<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> make<00:01:23.340> sure<00:01:23.450> excuse<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
want to make sure excuse me that you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.810 
want to make sure excuse me that you
don't<00:01:24.900> round<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.439> shoulders<00:01:25.470> forward<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
don't round your shoulders forward so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.190 
don't round your shoulders forward so
the<00:01:26.970> tendency<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> good

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the tendency is to really get a good

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170 
the tendency is to really get a good
grip<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.770> tennis<00:01:29.100> ball<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.549> try<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> get

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
grip on this tennis ball you try to get

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
grip on this tennis ball you try to get
your<00:01:30.299> elbows<00:01:30.689> close<00:01:30.990> together<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.590> then

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
your elbows close together and then

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
your elbows close together and then
watch<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.220> happens<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.850> watch

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
watch what happens when I do this watch

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
watch what happens when I do this watch
my<00:01:33.600> shoulders<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.650> tend<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> round<00:01:35.310> forward

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670

my shoulders they tend to round forward
and<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:35.970> upper<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.780> curved<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320

shoulders will have to round forward
just<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:55.920> small<00:01:56.250> amount<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:57.090> again<00:01:57.270> we're

drill is we're trying to maintain some

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
drill is we're trying to maintain some
width<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.530> pinched

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
forearms as we did in the first part of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.920 
forearms as we did in the first part of
this<00:02:50.280> video<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.239> all<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.840> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
this video and all I want you to do is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.990 
this video and all I want you to do is
turn<00:02:52.110> back<00:02:52.319> as<00:02:52.470> far<00:02:52.739> as<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.250> again<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
turn back as far as you can again as I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.420 
turn back as far as you can again as I
mentioned<00:02:54.030> without<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.319> straining<00:02:55.830> all

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
mentioned without really straining all

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.830 
mentioned without really straining all
right<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.700> both<00:02:56.880> my<00:02:57.120> arms<00:02:57.299> are<00:02:57.450> straight<00:02:57.690> at

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
right so both my arms are straight at

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.839 
right so both my arms are straight at
this<00:02:57.930> point<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.620> would<00:02:58.769> be<00:02:58.920> an<00:02:59.040> extremely

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
this point this would be an extremely

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.910 
this point this would be an extremely
wide<00:03:00.090> arc<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.720> I'm<00:03:00.780> creating<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.140> very<00:03:01.470> wide<00:03:01.680> arc

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
wide arc so I'm creating a very wide arc

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.650 
wide arc so I'm creating a very wide arc
when<00:03:02.040> I'm<00:03:02.130> going<00:03:02.370> back<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.940> bigger<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.450> arc

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
when I'm going back the bigger the arc

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.589 
when I'm going back the bigger the arc
you<00:03:03.810> make<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:04.650> distance<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.250> get

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
you make the more distance you can get

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.670 
you make the more distance you can get
so<00:03:06.599> I'm<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.080> do<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.319> couple<00:03:07.380> more

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so I'm going to do this a couple more

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.190 
so I'm going to do this a couple more
times<00:03:08.299> bigger<00:03:09.299> arc<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.810> you'll<00:03:09.900> notice<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
times bigger arc and you'll notice that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.839 
times bigger arc and you'll notice that
this<00:03:10.470> lanyard<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.250> string<00:03:11.519> is<00:03:11.580> really

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
this lanyard and this string is really

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.750 
this lanyard and this string is really
being<00:03:12.120> stretched<00:03:12.660> out<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.470> not<00:03:13.760> hanging

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
being stretched out it's not hanging

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.180 
being stretched out it's not hanging
loose<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.299> if<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.140> let<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.410> hang<00:03:16.830> loose

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
loose like this if I let that hang loose

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520 
loose like this if I let that hang loose
that's<00:03:18.090> usually<00:03:18.450> indicative<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.049> my<00:03:19.260> left

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
that's usually indicative that my left

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.740 
that's usually indicative that my left
arm<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:20.130> bending<00:03:20.820> down<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.269> now<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.420> can<00:03:21.600> see

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
arm is bending down and now you can see

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.569 
arm is bending down and now you can see
this<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.109> really<00:03:22.140> really<00:03:22.560> loose<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.280> my<00:03:23.370> left

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.340 
this is really really loose and my left
arm<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> breaking<00:03:24.150> down<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.540> again<00:03:24.959> as<00:03:25.260> I
