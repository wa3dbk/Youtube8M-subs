00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
have one of these what it does is the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.550 
have one of these what it does is the
air<00:03:12.299> comes<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:12.959> little<00:03:13.110> hole<00:03:13.350> right<00:03:13.380> here

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
air comes to this little hole right here

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.100 
air comes to this little hole right here
and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.579> goes<00:03:14.700> out<00:03:14.940> like<00:03:15.209> bigger<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:15.810> so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and then it goes out like bigger here so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.600 
and then it goes out like bigger here so
then<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:16.829> then<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.070> hair<00:03:17.250> doesn't<00:03:17.400> get

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
frizzy when do it and because more

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.400 
frizzy when do it and because more
volume<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> great<00:03:22.110> way<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.290> get

you keep okay so overall Evita is really
good<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.739> do<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:12.640> couple<00:04:12.819> of<00:04:13.030> follow<00:04:13.270> ways

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
good I do have a couple of follow ways

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.960 
good I do have a couple of follow ways
but<00:04:14.349> in<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.920> little<00:04:15.130> bit<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.310> frizziness<00:04:15.580> but<00:04:15.910> I

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970
