are<00:01:29.370> touching<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.120> take<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.510> dotting<00:01:30.990> tool

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
are touching you can take a dotting tool
and<00:01:31.470> swirl<00:01:31.830> them<00:01:32.040> together<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.330> make

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and swirl them together this will make

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.090 
and swirl them together this will make
the<00:01:33.690> in-between<00:01:34.290> color<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.799> make<00:01:34.950> your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the in-between color to make your

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.459 
the in-between color to make your
gradient<00:01:35.370> look<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.880> little<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.330> smooth

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
gradient look a little more smooth

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.649 
gradient look a little more smooth
then<00:01:39.469> take<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.920> cosmetic<00:01:40.670> sponge<00:01:40.969> and<00:01:41.299> dip<00:01:41.509> it

down<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.320> skin<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> figured<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.760> would

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
down to the skin so I figured this would

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.150 
down to the skin so I figured this would
be<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.060> good<00:02:53.330> time<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.630> make<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:53.990> super<00:02:54.650> simple
