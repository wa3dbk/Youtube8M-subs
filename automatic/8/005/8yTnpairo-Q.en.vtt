00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.129
 very good children again micra 41 20 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.869
 1.8 calls already as an experienced link 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.580
 this name comes because the creator is 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.619
 Italian and of or good and as I suppose 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.779
 will be your name the guys thing this 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.910
 what it does is bring plants 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.890
 cultures of experiences if they are not 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.990
 super crops 7 to 2 how can we do 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.490
 for example in tinker it is cost look that 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.530
 We will have a plant of experience and 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.019
 we get the biggest thing but in this 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.480
 case the crops are going to be expensive and 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.190
 Well, it's going to be unique because of the sound 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.809
 we can not get to produce the seed 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.430
 in no way therefore is it a 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.440
 So it's next the seeds 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 free is very very well 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.129
 compensated plus I think it's even 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.510
 of course, but it 's very good, it's very 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.280
 well because maybe with some way 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 we can have an infinite maybe 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.360
 what we are basically going to spend 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.399
 etcetera and good because it's cool the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.500
 gold exchange plant 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.390
 experience not then how are you guys 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.420
 create the seed that this case would be this 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.820
 here it would be eight gold already 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.830
 warning with gold is essential plus a 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.229
 seed wheat voucher of these then 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.740
 having this we get the experience 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.970
 OK 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.470
 I'm going to wear one of these 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.660
 inventories or 64 that is worth 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.090
 it's scissors and let's say I'm going to remove 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.190
 this here is worth then the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.930
 I'm going to spend the experience 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.760
 go placing here and let's leave 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.370
 that grows as well as I'm going to put you 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.440
 example bone powder to emulate the 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.690
 growth that you will have when 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.800
 we have the plant on but good 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.810
 how are you looking to start growing 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.120
 little by little the guys thing when 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.730
 grow is going to start giving the plant 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.630
 experiences already with this we already have the 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.250
 experience 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.440
 and as you can see he also has experience 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.050
 but - and I'm not sure you can get there 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.960
 to use I will put myself at your level and 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.880
 I'm going to give you here, take something out of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320
 perfect experience it has dried 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.660
 some experience however from here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 let's create something else here too 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.400
 we have a little bit here we also have and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.200
 here and here and here and here and here and here 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.479
 and here it's worth and now it's just missing 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.890
 again wait for the plant to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.570
 experience grow back however 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.459
 we have to take special care 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.290
 with the villagers, you see that here 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.790
 we have a villager because he is seeing 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.740
 tests has already been reading here in the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.420
 official pont and said that the villagers were 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.459
 Charge the traps are the traps the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.140
 plants and it is true in this case 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.980
 the villagers not all but the villager 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 that is dedicated 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.569
 the crops will break the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.010
 plants is totally true and we have 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.930
 to be very careful because if we 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.250
 we plant in a village surely we 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.480
 we were in silver experience because the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:42.660
 villager will do the job of how it is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.500
 collect but the plants because 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.170
 it seems that none of these who know no 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.000
 still not or that no farmer and 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.760
 medium farmers really or know 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.129
 yes yes now we get some for now 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.090
 nothing I'm going to take out sometime worth guys 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.410
 we have one here 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.680
 this is the farmer and how are you 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 seeing then he will go collecting but 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.269
 As it does not exist, I do not care 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.030
 as you see the experience yes they take it out 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.590
 but the plants are loading 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.480
 also look at them leave them here 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.849
 which is a nice detail that at least 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.590
 but leave them loaded the following 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.870
 the chips the plants or that is 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.420
 a waste of time getting there 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.590
 to put one of these in the villages 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.409
 because in the end we will be left without 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.849
 plants we will have to grow it 30 yes 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:35.280
 we can collect things but it's a 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.260
 done having villagers nearby then 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.090
 guys is the mode does not have anything else 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.040
 it was only this is very easy and it is not 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.690
 very simple but it is a bowl that is very 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.980
 curious and that maybe people will 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.870
 can molar because a lot of people that I 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.220
 ask about the mold the team that is 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.019
 the part of the mole of zinc that the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.250
 construct that has the farm of 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.959
 experience have the plants this 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.640
 experience and there are people who have 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.200
 asked if any way to have that 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.359
 mode just seems interesting that is 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.090
 short or anything else then not 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.040
 there is but this is an alternative 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.160
 true that is not bad is more expensive but 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.750
 is an effective efficient alternative that 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.060
 it's not sealed that's pretty good 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.790
 I like it a lot so it's good though 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.349
 there will also be good people who will play 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.000
 minecraft technician and director is a 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.199
 foolishness is a waste of time because 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.299
 we can get more experience with 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.949
 a farm whatever but good that 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.049
 also for those who want to plant 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.000
 experience so here you have the mod so 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.780
 that if we want a lot we'll see each other in 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.780
 the next video 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.780
 wow 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.240
 Y 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 i
