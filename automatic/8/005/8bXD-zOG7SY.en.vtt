but it is this climate control I'm

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.810 
but it is this climate control I'm
speaking<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.210> the<00:00:21.210> two<00:00:21.420> dials<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
speaking of with the the two dials the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.160 
speaking of with the the two dials the
temperature<00:00:23.820> gauges<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.359> their<00:00:24.539> temperature

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
temperature gauges on their temperature

bit of lithium grease or dielectric
grease<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.439> should<00:01:40.590> work

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
grease on there and this should work

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.410 
grease on there and this should work
perfectly<00:01:40.979> we'll<00:01:41.579> look<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.030> again<00:01:42.210> two

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
perfectly we'll look at it again two

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.429 
perfectly we'll look at it again two
seconds<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.020> sure<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.290> working

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
seconds and make sure it's working

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.249 
seconds and make sure it's working
properly<00:01:43.799> hole<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> second<00:01:45.200> okay<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
properly hole of a second okay so

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.420 
properly hole of a second okay so
cleaned<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> tiniest<00:01:47.610> bit<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
cleaned it off got the tiniest bit of

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.410 
cleaned it off got the tiniest bit of
dielectric<00:01:50.430> grease<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.270> maybe

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
dielectric grease on it you can maybe

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.280 
dielectric grease on it you can maybe
see<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.290> I'm<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> pop<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.340> in

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
make sure it's working properly because

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.520 
make sure it's working properly because
it<00:02:10.209> was<00:02:10.299> just<00:02:10.509> sticking<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.989> was<00:02:11.140> sticking<00:02:11.379> in

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
it was just sticking it was sticking in

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
it was just sticking it was sticking in
when<00:02:11.680> we<00:02:11.769> pushed<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.510> now<00:02:15.209> cut<00:02:16.209> his<00:02:16.299> name

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
when we pushed it and now cut his name

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
and the EC and the rear defrost will

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.520 
and the EC and the rear defrost will
work<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.010> exact<00:02:21.310> same<00:02:21.340> way<00:02:22.170> these<00:02:23.170> two<00:02:23.349> aren't

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530

really<00:02:23.890> sticky<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.430> one<00:02:24.640> was<00:02:24.819> that's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
really sticky this one was that's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.089 
really sticky this one was that's
probably<00:02:25.959> where<00:02:26.080> all<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> pop<00:02:26.560> drain<00:02:26.920> down

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
and settled to when she opened it but we

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.860 
and settled to when she opened it but we
need<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.000> take<00:02:31.120> everything<00:02:31.510> apart

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
need to take everything apart

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.860 
need to take everything apart
