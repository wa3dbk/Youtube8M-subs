00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.830
 this week he announced his retirement from football 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 professional a player who was always 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 authentic a type that from which you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 You can take different memories but 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 that at the end of accounts beyond that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 I was a rocker beyond that I was a rebel 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.929
 that he had this long hair of his 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.180
 statements of their ways of acting 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.230
 your frontality to face things 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.850
 obviously I believe that there is 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 remember Juan Francisco Palencia as 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.720
 a professional guy as a bold guy 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 a man who knew how to take advantage of 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.799
 your physical to your physical power to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.739
 gym that he always applied and that 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.960
 evidently had different stages the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.549
 better for many I stay with 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.860
 that liberators cup that played like 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.839
 blue cross captain who was his champion 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.059
 of America that got wins 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.369
 resounding that he filled with all his 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.130
 team the aztec stadium to watch play 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.320
 to the machine a computer that convulsed 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.030
 the tournament a team that generated matches 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.649
 great like that in rosary against 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 central a team that won him river 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.560
 plate 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
 the country's capital a team that went to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.729
 the bombonera of Buenos Aires and put him 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.340
 face the set xeneize that after 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 lost in penalties with a palencia 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 plethoric in extraordinary palencia a 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.479
 palencia that later went to play 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.280
 Spain and playing Spanish put six 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.040
 goals that did not go wrong let's be honest 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.590
 he did not have a bad campaign is true his 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.659
 very expensive letter there were even problems of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
 that they did not want to lend them 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.990
 they wanted to sell it and in the espanyol of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.479
 people said that simply the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 option was to loan there was cut the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.990
 relationship with the machine was not treated 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.479
 good to juan francisco palencia a type 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 symbol a man who today prefers 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.390
 be of cougars prefer to go to the cougars 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.399
 wants your child to be a fan of the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 pumas to be blue cross so what 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.910
 they tried on the machine and so it went with 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.289
 francisco palencia a man who played the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.149
 world of France and another thing that had 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.100
 a lot of tail behind was the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.570
 discussion with javier aguirre in the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.130
 World of Korea-Japan 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.600
 he came as one of the references as 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 a man who could contribute a lot but 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.170
 who knows what happened in there that 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 final account which he had to pay 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.890
 was the soccer player goes to palencia 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.020
 a strange guy if in his ways in his 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.570

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.920

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.550
 youngsters in the cougars box and 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.440
 obviously we are going it to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.960
 to miss because players like him without 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 be a majestic technical gifted without being 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.580
 a truly monumental type in 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.650
 field issues if he was a player 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.910
 that was completely delivered in a 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.060
 professional throughout the extension of the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.580
