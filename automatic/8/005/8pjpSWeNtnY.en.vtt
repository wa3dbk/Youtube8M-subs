part and I'm going to pop that out of
the<00:00:40.219> way<00:00:40.370> as<00:00:40.550> well<00:00:40.929> I'm<00:00:41.929> going<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.170> attach<00:00:42.559> the

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
the way as well I'm going to attach the

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.630 
the way as well I'm going to attach the
extension<00:00:44.170> just<00:00:45.170> by<00:00:45.469> clipping<00:00:46.039> them<00:00:46.280> into<00:00:46.519> the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
extension just by clipping them into the

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.259 
extension just by clipping them into the
hair<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.420> ponytail<00:00:48.079> will<00:00:48.350> be<00:00:48.999> will<00:00:49.999> hold

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
hair that the ponytail will be will hold

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.209 
hair that the ponytail will be will hold
the<00:00:50.420> hair<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.660> place<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.260> won't<00:00:51.379> slip<00:00:51.649> off<00:00:51.859> and

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
the hair in place it won't slip off and

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.430 
the hair in place it won't slip off and
then<00:00:52.699> these<00:00:52.850> clips<00:00:53.179> will<00:00:53.359> just<00:00:53.600> really<00:00:54.079> grab

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
then these clips will just really grab

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.259 
then these clips will just really grab
that<00:00:54.679> area<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.249> and<00:00:55.519> stay<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:55.969> place

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
that area in and stay in place

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.360 
that area in and stay in place
so<00:00:56.870> I'm<00:00:56.929> going<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.230> place<00:00:57.440> each<00:00:57.739> one<00:00:57.769> of<00:00:58.190> these

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
so I'm going to place each one of these

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.509 
so I'm going to place each one of these
one<00:00:58.699> by<00:00:58.730> one<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.649> create<00:01:00.649> a<00:01:00.679> little<00:01:01.010> band<00:01:01.249> with

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
temporarily with a small clip and I'm

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.280 
temporarily with a small clip and I'm
creating<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.650> plat<00:01:41.950> around<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.210> branda<00:01:43.750> so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
creating the plat around the branda so

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.650 
creating the plat around the branda so
that<00:01:44.440> I'm<00:01:44.590> not<00:01:44.619> weaving<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.640> strand<00:01:46.479> by

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
that I'm not weaving it in strand by

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.870 
that I'm not weaving it in strand by
strand<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:47.410> rather<00:01:47.560> through<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.250> middle<00:01:48.610> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
strand but rather through the middle and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.660 
strand but rather through the middle and
that<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:50.200> keeps<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.770> place<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.369> haven't

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
that that keeps it in place so I haven't

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.999 
that that keeps it in place so I haven't
split<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.060> brando<00:01:52.479> into<00:01:52.750> three<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.380> it's

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
split the brando into three and it's

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.490 
split the brando into three and it's
short<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:54.970> you'll<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.600> tassels<00:01:56.080> come<00:01:56.320> out

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
short so you'll see the tassels come out

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.650 
short so you'll see the tassels come out
just<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:56.890> Khushi's<00:01:57.340> does<00:01:57.550> in<00:01:57.759> her<00:01:57.940> braid<00:01:58.270> and

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
just like Khushi's does in her braid and

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.669 
just like Khushi's does in her braid and
then<00:01:59.380> I'll<00:01:59.530> carry<00:01:59.830> on<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.100> rest<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.520> plant

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
then I'll carry on the rest of the plant

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.950 
then I'll carry on the rest of the plant
there's<00:02:02.679> three<00:02:03.009> tassels<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.880> then<00:02:04.420> I'm<00:02:04.570> carry

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.950 

I'm<00:03:42.460> not<00:03:43.460> going<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.670> sail<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.450> easy<00:03:44.660> to

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
I'm not going to sail it this is easy to

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.740 
I'm not going to sail it this is easy to
do<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.350> does<00:03:45.680> take<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> bit<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.280> practice<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.240> if

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
do it does take a bit of practice so if

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.200 
do it does take a bit of practice so if
you've<00:03:47.840> got<00:03:48.020> function<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.680> go<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.890> then<00:03:49.490> do

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
you've got function to go to then do

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.790 
you've got function to go to then do
practice<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.840> before<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.290> actual<00:03:51.590> day

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
practice it before the actual day

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.860 
practice it before the actual day
because<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.520> can<00:03:52.760> end<00:03:53.090> up<00:03:53.240> feeling<00:03:53.570> quite

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
because you can end up feeling quite

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.310 
because you can end up feeling quite
frustrated<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.800> your<00:03:54.920> arms<00:03:55.250> can't<00:03:56.170> if<00:03:57.170> you're

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
frustrated and your arms can't if you're

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.570 
frustrated and your arms can't if you're
good<00:03:57.500> with<00:03:57.680> hair<00:03:57.890> then<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.220> shouldn't<00:03:58.430> be<00:03:58.520> a

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
good with hair then it shouldn't be a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.990 
good with hair then it shouldn't be a
problem<00:03:58.640> at<00:03:59.000> all<00:04:00.100> then<00:04:01.100> these<00:04:01.250> two<00:04:01.490> front<00:04:01.790> bits

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
problem at all then these two front bits

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.060 
problem at all then these two front bits
I've<00:04:02.210> decided<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.810> twist<00:04:03.170> over<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.860> back

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
I've decided to twist over to the back

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:13.980 
I've decided to twist over to the back
and<00:04:04.460> then<00:04:04.640> drape<00:04:05.000> them<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.570> pin<00:04:05.870> them

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.370 

they're<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.329> backcombing<00:04:18.810> what<00:04:19.079> would<00:04:19.229> be

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
they're just backcombing what would be
