00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
variety of scenarios that can happen I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.109 
variety of scenarios that can happen I
like<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> go<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.369> hand<00:01:26.640> side<00:01:26.759> room

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
like to go to the right hand side room

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
like to go to the right hand side room
and<00:01:27.299> place<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.810> charge<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> safe<00:01:28.770> now

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and place my charge on this safe now

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.690 
and place my charge on this safe now
this<00:01:30.000> safe<00:01:30.270> might<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:31.110> allow<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.829> use<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this safe might not allow you to use a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
this safe might not allow you to use a
shape<00:01:33.270> charge<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.560> 50/50<00:01:35.250> chance

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shape charge on it it's a 50/50 chance

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
shape charge on it it's a 50/50 chance
sometimes<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> use<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> drill<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
sometimes you have to use a drill and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
sometimes you have to use a drill and
then<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> 50/50<00:01:38.520> chance<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.060> tiaras

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
then it's a 50/50 chance of two tiaras

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
then it's a 50/50 chance of two tiaras
in<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> might<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> other<00:01:41.400> safe

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
in there it might be in the other safe

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060 
in there it might be in the other safe
now<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.689> you're<00:01:42.840> lucky<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.649> it'll<00:01:43.979> be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
now if you're lucky like I was it'll be

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.410 
now if you're lucky like I was it'll be
in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> safe<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> pick<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
in the safe you want to pick it up and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.760 
in the safe you want to pick it up and
sprint<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:45.930> back<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> car

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
sprint right back to the car

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
sprint right back to the car
if<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.280> wasn't<00:01:47.549> you'll<00:01:47.850> probably<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
if it wasn't you'll probably want to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.550 
if it wasn't you'll probably want to
restart<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> mission<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.259> try<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
restart the mission and then try the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.249 
restart the mission and then try the
same<00:01:49.950> process<00:01:50.850> over<00:01:51.180> again<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> again<00:01:51.810> until

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
same process over again and again until

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350 
same process over again and again until
you<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.979> car<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.399> spawn<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> safe

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you get the car to spawn in that safe

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
you get the car to spawn in that safe
and<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:54.960> use<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> shaped<00:01:55.530> charge<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.890> order

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and you can use a shaped charge in order

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.459 
and you can use a shaped charge in order
to<00:01:56.159> take<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.299> again<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.409> said

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
to take it out now again as I said

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.440 
to take it out now again as I said
before<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> boosting<00:02:00.119> online

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
before you can do this boosting online

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.120 
before you can do this boosting online
with<00:02:00.630> someone<00:02:00.930> who<00:02:01.049> has<00:02:01.229> shaped<00:02:01.530> charges<00:02:01.920> have

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
with someone who has shaped charges have

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.340 
with someone who has shaped charges have
everyone<00:02:02.610> wait<00:02:03.000> at<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> truck<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.170> they

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
everyone wait at the truck and if they

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.899 
everyone wait at the truck and if they
run<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> route<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.399> quick<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> they
