00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
cameras and they're all color they just

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
cameras and they're all color they just
have<00:00:32.640> different<00:00:32.669> options<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.420> different

have different options in different

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
have different options in different
styles<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.290> let's<00:00:34.829> start<00:00:35.010> looking<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
styles so let's start looking at some of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.840 
styles so let's start looking at some of
our<00:00:35.670> cameras<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.110> our<00:00:37.469> r.v<00:00:37.680> camera<00:00:38.340> it's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
our cameras this is our r.v camera it's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
our cameras this is our r.v camera it's
meant<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.210> mounted<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> top<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.230> RV

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
meant to be mounted at the top of an RV

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
meant to be mounted at the top of an RV
and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:40.800> angled<00:00:41.579> downward<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and then angled downward like so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
and then angled downward like so
you've<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> Sun<00:00:43.140> shield<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.649> basically

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you've got a Sun shield here basically

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
you've got a Sun shield here basically
you<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.820> find<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> comfortable<00:00:45.600> position

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you just find the comfortable position

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.270 
you just find the comfortable position
for<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
for you and then you can see how it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
for you and then you can see how it
works<00:00:47.510> also<00:00:48.510> got<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> bumper<00:00:49.050> camera<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:50.070> one

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
works also got a bumper camera this one

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279 
works also got a bumper camera this one
simply<00:00:50.550> drills<00:00:50.879> into<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.239> bumper<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
simply drills into your bumper like so

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
simply drills into your bumper like so
and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.280> everything<00:00:53.370> behind

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and then you can see everything behind

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
and then you can see everything behind
you<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> third<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.559> our

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you and then the third time we have our

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
you and then the third time we have our
license<00:00:56.160> plate<00:00:56.190> cameras<00:00:56.670> we've<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
license plate cameras we've got to the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
license plate cameras we've got to the
non<00:00:58.199> CCD<00:00:58.770> version<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> CCD<00:01:00.030> version<00:01:00.420> see

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
non CCD version and the CCD version see

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
non CCD version and the CCD version see
see<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.039> more<00:01:02.129> durable<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
see these a little bit more durable and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.130 
see these a little bit more durable and
it's<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> higher<00:01:03.359> quality<00:01:03.870> they're<00:01:03.989> all

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's got a higher quality they're all

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's got a higher quality they're all
great<00:01:04.439> cameras<00:01:04.860> they're<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.489> color<00:01:05.820> they're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
great cameras they're all color they're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
great cameras they're all color they're
all<00:01:06.420> night<00:01:06.659> vision<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.740> our<00:01:07.890> top<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
all night vision but this is our top of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.649 
all night vision but this is our top of
the<00:01:08.220> line<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> CCD<00:01:09.450> lens

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the line because it's got the CCD lens

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
the line because it's got the CCD lens
for<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> license<00:01:10.439> plate<00:01:11.150> now<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.330> does<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
for the license plate now how does it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480 
for the license plate now how does it
work<00:01:12.720> well<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> cameras<00:01:14.130> look<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
work well all the cameras look up the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.760 
work well all the cameras look up the
same<00:01:14.670> way<00:01:14.820> you've<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.540> cables<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.650> an

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
same way you've got two cables one is an

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.649 
same way you've got two cables one is an
RCA<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> power<00:01:17.880> let's<00:01:18.299> start<00:01:18.540> with

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
RCA and one is a power let's start with

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.800 
RCA and one is a power let's start with
a<00:01:18.689> power<00:01:19.340> power<00:01:20.340> cable<00:01:20.759> plugs<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
a power power cable plugs in like so and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.859 
a power power cable plugs in like so and
then<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.680> goes<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> 12<00:01:23.670> volt<00:01:23.939> power<00:01:24.540> now

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then this goes to a 12 volt power now

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
then this goes to a 12 volt power now
you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.350> either<00:01:25.530> connect<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> constant

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you can either connect it to a constant

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
you can either connect it to a constant
power<00:01:26.880> where<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.540> always<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.290> you're

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
power where it's always on so if you're

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
power where it's always on so if you're
on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> freeway<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.700> whoever's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
on the freeway you can see whoever's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.749 
on the freeway you can see whoever's
behind<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.810> problem<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.520> hook<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
behind you no problem or you can hook it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.999 
behind you no problem or you can hook it
up<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> reverse<00:01:33.600> light<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> go

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
up to a reverse light so when you go

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
up to a reverse light so when you go
into<00:01:35.130> reverse<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> light<00:01:35.970> pops<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
into reverse and the light pops on it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.940 
into reverse and the light pops on it
gives<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> power<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> camera<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> camera

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
gives the power to the camera the camera

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
gives the power to the camera the camera
turns<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.939> monitor<00:01:39.299> turns<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.750> then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you go into drive and it all turns off

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
you go into drive and it all turns off

now<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.440> hooked<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.069> these<00:02:11.160> earlier

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
now we hooked up one of these earlier

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.740 
now we hooked up one of these earlier
today<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.090> show<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.569> looks

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
today just to show you what it looks

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
today just to show you what it looks
like<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.379> it's<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.560> lift<00:02:13.800> up<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> constant

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
like so it's just lift up to a constant

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.089 
like so it's just lift up to a constant
12<00:02:14.700> volt<00:02:14.879> battery<00:02:15.360> now<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:16.020> cars<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.709> RVs<00:02:17.069> and

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
12 volt battery now all cars and RVs and

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.400 
12 volt battery now all cars and RVs and
buses<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.819> boats<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.360> run<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.750> 12<00:02:19.140> volts

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
buses and boats they all run on 12 volts

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.720 
buses and boats they all run on 12 volts
so<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.739> will<00:02:19.890> work<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> them

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so this will work with all of them

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.720 
so this will work with all of them
vintage<00:02:21.239> cars<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:21.660> well<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.280> you've<00:02:23.400> got<00:02:23.580> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
vintage cars as well so you've got this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.809 
vintage cars as well so you've got this
camera<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.420> color<00:02:24.660> camera<00:02:25.400> 7-inch<00:02:26.400> monitor

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
camera it's color camera 7-inch monitor

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.150 
camera it's color camera 7-inch monitor
with<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> Sun<00:02:27.480> shield<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.989> I've<00:02:28.739> got<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.010> hooked

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
with a Sun shield and I've got it hooked

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.619 
with a Sun shield and I've got it hooked
up<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.819> could<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.120> I'm<00:02:30.209> pointing<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
up and as you could see I'm pointing it

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.860 
up and as you could see I'm pointing it
at<00:02:30.720> me<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.610> angle<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.150> camera<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:33.780> if

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
at me and I can angle this camera so if

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.020 
at me and I can angle this camera so if
you<00:02:33.930> take<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> look<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.379> camera<00:02:34.709> down<00:02:35.250> or<00:02:35.580> up

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
you take a look at the camera down or up

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.380 
you take a look at the camera down or up
so<00:02:36.989> if<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.160> Honda<00:02:38.580> let's<00:02:39.000> say<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so if you have a Honda let's say and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.119 
so if you have a Honda let's say and
it's<00:02:39.480> lower<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> ground<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.830> you'd<00:02:40.980> have

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
it's lower to the ground then you'd have

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.500 
it's lower to the ground then you'd have
it<00:02:41.310> angled<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.360> could

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
it angled like this and then you could

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.820 
it angled like this and then you could
just<00:02:42.660> see<00:02:42.780> everything<00:02:43.200> behind<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.709> no

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
just see everything behind you no

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.449 
just see everything behind you no
problem

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
problem

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.400 
problem
but<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.879> had<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> Ford<00:02:45.480> f-150<00:02:46.050> what

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
but if you had like a Ford f-150 what

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.170 
but if you had like a Ford f-150 what
you'd<00:02:46.530> want<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:47.489> angle<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.940> down<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you'd want to do was angle it down a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.860 
you'd want to do was angle it down a
little<00:02:48.510> bit

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
little bit

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.119 
little bit
so<00:02:49.080> it'd<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.200> easier<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:49.830> what's<00:02:49.980> behind

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
so it'd be easier to see what's behind

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.250 
so it'd be easier to see what's behind
you<00:02:50.519> again<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.360> personal<00:02:51.720> preference<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.530 
you again it's personal preference and
it's<00:02:52.379> up<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.940> that's<00:02:54.090> everything<00:02:54.360> we
