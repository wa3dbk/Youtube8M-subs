00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.379 
conservative
in<00:04:24.620> one<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.889> the<00:04:24.950> movies<00:04:25.310> Batman<00:04:26.060> does

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
in one of the movies Batman does

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.390 
in one of the movies Batman does
warrantless<00:04:26.840> wiretapping<00:04:27.470> he's<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.160> little

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
warrantless wiretapping he's a little

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.160 
warrantless wiretapping he's a little
torn<00:04:28.639> up<00:04:28.790> about<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:29.360> nonetheless<00:04:29.540> he<00:04:29.960> does
