00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 good good people how are they both 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
 time without smelling us good as you will see 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 here I made another fucking video of how 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.980
 install the skins for your gta san 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 andreas but better explained hopefully 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 serve the idiots who do not understand 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.330
 these shits xd xd from good 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.640
 Let's start with the fucking video that maybe not 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 you started it 20 seconds ago 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.980
 Shut up damn excrement swallow milk 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.470
 good let's start good the skins 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.449
 we will install with the alt cmg editor and if 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.210
 they do not have it, I'll leave them the link of the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.399
 download and we will also need 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 these two files that are employment and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.379
 the good skins folder the first thing is that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 let's find our gta san folder 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.809
 andreas and there will be all the files 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.059
 of the game but one thing that is missing is 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.100
 folder I think that we should install it 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 If you do not have it, I'll leave you the link of the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.530
 download good we open the folder and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.530
 will be this and click on the exe key 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.900
 we will appear this we give to next 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.980
 and here in this part we have to put 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.180
 the address where our 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.180
 San Andreas folder 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 we mark the folder and we give it to ok 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.340
 then to next next and then to 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 install 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 already installed we go to our folder 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.500
 of the game and we look for the folder I think 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.710
 and as you will see there is the folder that I read 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.170
 is already installed 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.510
 and within these files are 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.870
 but those do not touch them or eliminate 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.370
 now we go for the next step 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.290
 we open the skins folder and we 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.300
 these files and the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.090
 instructions but if you see in the video 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.429
 well the instructions will not serve you 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 well now we open the folder of san 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.250
 andreas 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.530
 and notice what I do here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.899
 the file that is inside the folder 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 data from skins we pass to the folder 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.420
 data that is in the san folder 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.420
 andreas 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.430
 we put you move and replace 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.510
 now we go to the folder I think and after 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.799
 we passed the files that are in the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.799
 skins kernel folder 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.380
 well now the first step is done 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.360
 of the installation that I need more 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.430
 you shut up excrement 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.830
 now let's put the skins to the game 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.260
 but first we need a skins and what 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.680

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.880

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.360
 discharge 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.829
 we wait for 5 seconds and we give 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.829
 Skip ad 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.640

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.160
 file to desktop and then we create a 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.020
 new folder on the desktop them 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.880
 I recommend that you put the name of the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.880
 skins so you do not get confused 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.480
 and we passed the files that were in the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.480
 downloaded skins folder 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.310
 only these two files 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.310
 now we open the al cie mg editor 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:42.639
 and we're going to file and now and here in 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.800
 this part we look for the gta folder 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.159
 san andreas and we go to the folder 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.159
 cleo 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:56.010

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:00.229

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.229

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.090

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.090
 that is, the skins folder 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.710

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:30.310

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:35.890
