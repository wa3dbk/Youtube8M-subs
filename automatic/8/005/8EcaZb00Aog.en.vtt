curse that's what I look at I think the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.460 
curse that's what I look at I think the
entire<00:01:40.409> country<00:01:40.950> could<00:01:41.270> identify<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.720> us

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and our team in our city and all that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.800 
and our team in our city and all that
we've<00:01:45.060> been<00:01:45.090> through<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
we've been through it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.819 
we've been through it
you<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.140> felt<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> piece<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you just felt like there was a piece of

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
you just felt like there was a piece of
everybody<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> wanted<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:48.390> us<00:01:48.509> win<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
everybody that wanted to see us win and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 
everybody that wanted to see us win and
I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.009> why<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
I think that's why when people see the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.340 
I think that's why when people see the
cover

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
cover

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.830 
cover
it<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.649> takes<00:01:52.829> him<00:01:52.979> back

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
it just takes him back

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.399 
it just takes him back
