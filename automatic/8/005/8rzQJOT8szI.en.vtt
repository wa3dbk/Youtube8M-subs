00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
been commenting that this update is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.850 
been commenting that this update is
going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> ruin<00:00:12.300> barge<00:00:12.509> forever<00:00:12.780> because<00:00:13.650> now

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
going to ruin barge forever because now

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.620 
going to ruin barge forever because now
the<00:00:14.309> troops<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.969> work<00:00:15.120> together<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the troops are going to work together to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.450 
the troops are going to work together to
break<00:00:15.870> open<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.320> single<00:00:16.770> wall<00:00:16.949> piece<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
break open a single wall piece and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519 
break open a single wall piece and
that's<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.330> cause<00:00:18.539> them<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.960> bunch<00:00:19.260> up

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
that's going to cause them to bunch up

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.519 
that's going to cause them to bunch up
and<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:20.490> destroyed<00:00:20.820> by<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.270> splash<00:00:22.140> towers

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and get destroyed by the splash towers

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
and get destroyed by the splash towers
we're<00:00:23.189> also<00:00:23.340> unable<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.970> lure<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.240> heroes

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
we're also unable to lure out the heroes

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.970 
we're also unable to lure out the heroes
now<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.199> think<00:00:25.230> that's<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> make<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
now and I think that's going to make a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.240 
now and I think that's going to make a
huge<00:00:26.340> difference<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.840> honest<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.439> think

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
huge difference but to be honest I think

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.519 
huge difference but to be honest I think
it's<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> positive<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.529> this

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it's going to be a positive one so this

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's going to be a positive one so this
space<00:00:31.830> looks<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> good<00:00:32.550> test<00:00:32.820> subject

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
space looks like a good test subject

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.889 
space looks like a good test subject
we've<00:00:33.630> got<00:00:33.840> max<00:00:34.440> defenses<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:36.570> heroes

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
we've got max defenses and the heroes

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
we've got max defenses and the heroes

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
we're unable to live out the heroes but

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.529 
we're unable to live out the heroes but
I<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> try<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> alert<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> clan<00:00:51.510> castle

troops<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.129> might<00:00:53.340> be

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
troops because it looks like we might be

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
troops because it looks like we might be
able<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.770> guess<00:00:55.949> not

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
able to from right here but i guess not

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
able to from right here but i guess not
because<00:00:56.340> although<00:00:56.879> barbarians<00:00:57.480> took<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> class

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
because although barbarians took a class

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.950 
because although barbarians took a class
on<00:00:58.230> how<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.530> break<00:00:59.070> open<00:00:59.219> walls<00:00:59.719> they're<00:01:00.719> still

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
on how to break open walls they're still

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.830 
on how to break open walls they're still
stupid<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:02.100> no<00:01:02.280> strategical<00:01:02.850> mind<00:01:03.059> but

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
stupid and have no strategical mind but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
stupid and have no strategical mind but
anyways<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.339> hundred

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
anyways I don't think it's one hundred

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
anyways I don't think it's one hundred
percent<00:01:05.729> necessary<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.720> i<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.530> i'm<00:01:07.650> going

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
percent necessary but i think i'm going

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.080 
percent necessary but i think i'm going
to<00:01:07.860> take<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.130> one<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> mortars<00:01:08.790> with

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to take out one of the mortars with

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.840 
to take out one of the mortars with
lighting<00:01:09.600> spells<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.409> i<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.580> i'm<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
lighting spells and i think i'm going to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
lighting spells and i think i'm going to
take<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.720> over<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> right

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
take out this one over here on the right

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920 
take out this one over here on the right
and<00:01:14.000> then<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> start<00:01:15.509> our<00:01:15.630> attack

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and then we're going to start our attack

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890 
and then we're going to start our attack
and<00:01:16.670> honestly<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:17.970> weird<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.450> having<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and honestly it's so weird not having to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
and honestly it's so weird not having to
lure<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> heroes<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
lure out the heroes I was like one of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
lure out the heroes I was like one of
the<00:01:21.450> main<00:01:22.320> things<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the main things that you would do and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300 
the main things that you would do and
pretty<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.090> any<00:01:24.420> attack<00:01:24.920> we'd<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> lure

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
pretty much any attack we'd have to lure

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.080 
pretty much any attack we'd have to lure
the<00:01:26.460> zeros<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.720> can't<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.680> like

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
the zeros and now we can't just like

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.160 
the zeros and now we can't just like
supercell<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.329> threw<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> huge<00:01:30.869> curveball

supercell just threw a huge curveball
and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.250> don't<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> deal<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and I don't know how to deal with it

and I don't know how to deal with it
it's<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.159> weird<00:01:36.049> okay<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.280> now<00:01:38.280> I'm

staying<00:02:28.930> behind<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.230> walls<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.740> we<00:02:30.640> were

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
staying behind the walls and we were

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520 
staying behind the walls and we were
able<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.240> take<00:02:31.450> out<00:02:31.600> these<00:02:31.750> surrounding

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
buildings so I don't think the heroes

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.210 
buildings so I don't think the heroes
are<00:02:35.110> going<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.290> have<00:02:35.380> too<00:02:35.530> much<00:02:35.650> an<00:02:35.770> effect<00:02:36.100> to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
really close to the side as well you can

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.300 
really close to the side as well you can
see<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.260> didn't<00:02:41.590> even<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.980> worry<00:02:42.190> about

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
see we didn't even have to worry about

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.520 
see we didn't even have to worry about
the<00:02:42.490> barbarian<00:02:42.940> King<00:02:43.150> most<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.290> most

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
the barbarian King most of the most

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.830 
the barbarian King most of the most
bases<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.220> heroes<00:02:45.760> are<00:02:45.880> actually<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
bases the heroes are actually in the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.870 
bases the heroes are actually in the
center<00:02:47.200> also<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.310> honest<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.610> don't<00:02:48.670> even

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
center also to be honest I don't even

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.160 
center also to be honest I don't even
think<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.210> need<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> rage<00:02:49.630> spell<00:02:49.870> anymore

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
because the Queen gets powered up when

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.690 
because the Queen gets powered up when
you<00:02:52.300> use<00:02:52.450> her<00:02:52.570> ability<00:02:53.020> so<00:02:53.770> in<00:02:54.370> conclusion
