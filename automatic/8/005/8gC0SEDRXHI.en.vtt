00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.510
 very good saints welcome the day of 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.440
 today I will proceed to teach them to 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.800
 review this magic trick called this 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.350
 that and this other 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.970
 for this trick we're going to need three 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.830
 letters from a common deck and running well 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.240
 and as always I will start with 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.369
 show them the trick 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.189
 as you may have noticed here we have 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.369
 three clearly common letters and 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.369
 currents 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:40.870
 we can see the first letter a cradle 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.310
 the second letter a ruin also 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.730
 and the third letter a kaiser 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.489
 very well 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.040
 what we would do is leave 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.280
 the kaiser down well 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.150
 but let's see that actually down 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.150
 we have a cradle 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.030
 but up 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.600
 we also have a crib 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.710
 then the center should be the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.480
 kaiser 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.050
 but we also have a care 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.650
 the truth is that the deceived always 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.490
 we have had the kaiser down but 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.840
 as well 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 it has always been up 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 and also 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 he has always been to the center 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.630
 but we're going to put it this way 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 let's say that I 've always had this 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.469
 s 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.469
 and this other 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.940
 well how to perform this trick 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.900
 As I mentioned, we are going to need three 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.750
 ordinary cards of a deck 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.000
 well I use the cuina and the kaiser 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.910
 of spades but can use those that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.280
 you want the truth does not affect the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.350
 order and can do it to your liking 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.530
 they will start the trick saying they have 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.220
 three letters and when they are showing them 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.990
 what they will do is that they will take this 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.240
 letter with your thumb in this way 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.360
 all right 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.520
 so when we do this we close the mallet 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.850
 and when closing it like we had the finger 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.820
 thumb as you can see has been a 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.730
 hole between the two letters above and 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.730
 the last letter to this is called break 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.550
 ok and they say they're going to show the first 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.880
 letter and they grab this pack of two 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.630
 letters 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.600
 with thumb and middle finger from 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.660
 the upper and lower parts and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.670
 show the first letter when in 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.709
 actually there are two good 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.260
 Be careful not to let them 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.540
 escape the ace that is below and now 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.390
 well once they showed the first 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.170
 letter that is a cradle supposedly go 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.260
 to return this button to the package of letters 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.750
 and they're going to rule out the supposed cradle 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.510
 when we can see here that is the ace 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.310
 all right 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.080
 now it shows in the second letter with 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.710
 normality cuÃ±a this time in truth 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.900
 and now the third letter 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.680
 kaiser as a team to see well 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.719
 they take them from the table 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.609
 and now what they will do is something very simple 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.019
 they will say they are going to leave the case work and 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.849
 what it is really doing is 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.079
 quickly take the letter goes to 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:56.230
 place it up so that it does not 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.330
 note a lot 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.970
 and even if you notice this is a movement 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.240
 that confuses people what can 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.510
 teach then take the letter below 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.819
 and puts it up 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.569
 and now they indicate to the people that down 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.750
 we have a crib and now they say they are going to 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.489
 check the top part 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.450
 for this movement what they want is 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.020
 take the pack of cards with your hand 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.599
 left well 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.419
 in this way little finger and ring finger 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:34.060
 medium and index in a part of the letter 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.650
 and the thumb in this way in another 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.810
 and what they will do is come with the hand 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.110
 right on the middle finger and they will pull the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.710
 first card of the deck down well 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.910
 once they climbed it down 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.910
 taking it with your thumb in this way 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.830
 they are now going to move their middle middle finger 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.680
 half plan up and push the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.780
 second letter what this produces is that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.420
 push the first card down the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.260
 second up and the first letter 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:11.950
 it meets the one below as you can see 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:16.110
 and now they just take both letters and 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.970
 they show as if there was a crib upstairs 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.470
 they turn this package around and teach that 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.330
 There is a crib that is the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.430
 we just moved 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.280
 now they explain that they have always had the 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.249
 Kaiser down and repeat this movement 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.249
 saying they have a problem 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:36.849
 well we can see again this 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.849
 movement 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.689
 show that the kaiser is above 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.490
 return to the two-card package 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.039
 discreetly you do not see that there are two 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.439
 letters and they show that the medium also 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.870
 there is a kaiser and now is when they say 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:55.629
 but we 're going to put it this way 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.689
 let's see that here we have good in 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:02.770
 this step is where they are discarding 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:05.020
 letters like that nothing else without any trick and 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.580
 they say the following we are going to see that here 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.280
 we have that 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.889
 this 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.580
 and this other 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:19.310
 well the truth is this is a trick 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.010
 not difficult 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.230
 It also produces a very good effect 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.850
 truth is very impressive to see and 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.270
 I hope you liked it until the 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.270
 next
