00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.750
 friends of events if the engine 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.519
 let's see the info on this topic 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:18.270
 208 complete and with a display of 7 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.420
 inch touchscreen to interact with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.120
 the infotainment as you see there is no 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.860
 cd player is an optional but i would say that 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.870
 with all the possibilities offered this 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.720
 108 is an option that we do not recommend 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.600
 to buy because because below 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 we even have two usb inputs 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.560
 in mine they attacked the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 usb stick and an iphone 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.270
 auxiliary input to connect 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 any analogue source besides that is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.690
 bluetooth is also present for both 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.380
 audio calls both for streaming but 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.700
 I'll go see the infotainment menu 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.560
 we only have three physical buttons 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.690
 this to raise the volume down and 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.090
 start 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.040
 the audio this to change the three 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.409
 main screens then the screen 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.880
 with the navigator map 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.889
 the screen with information on 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 on the car therefore average consumption speed 

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.270
 average distance traveled and consumption 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.999
 snapshots as well as autonomy is the last 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 screen dedicated to the general menu from 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:23.310
 this menu can also be defined 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.850
 preferences both of the system then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.709
 brightness, color, harmony 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:35.610
 of the infotainment the batch was then e 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:37.750
 others and other adjustments always by me 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.030
 we can define the preferences of the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.320
 vehicle to activate or not the technician if 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.329
 he owns it when we reverse it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.920
 it is raining access the lighting there are 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.820
 all those settings that allow 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.750
 we can customize the vehicle 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.929
 also from this menu go to the part 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.429
 media then radio music or photographs 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.840
 because we can also see the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.319
 photographs uploaded to the flash drive 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.049
 USB pendrive 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.179
 in this screen communication 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.580
 let's see the bluetooth settings 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 we can connect as many phones as 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.380
 you see supports the connection is not e 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.970
 simultaneous but many phones in the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.130
 list for call list e 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.630
 contacts the contacts are absorbed 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.060
 from our phone so there is no one 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.370
 second heading of the infotainment 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.810
 this is good 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.319
 let's talk about navigation then we'll talk 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.660
 of the middle part and of audio the part 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.310
 navigation consists of three icons that 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.310
 see the navigation traffic map 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.130
 driving traffic takes formations 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.630
 from the tmc regarding ho 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.269
 crushed that and not back the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.250
 navigation you can enter 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.530
 the address take the addresses that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.150
 we always keep in our contacts 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.170
 bluetooth or click a button 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.720
 on the map 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.150
 now we choose address I make you 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.079
 see the beautiful insertion this 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.350
 this keyboard so rounded that it has one 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.970
 a sense of roundness to the display when 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.350
 we insert the city ​​as the letters 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.400
 the options disappear 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.260
 possible 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.269
 ok we give milano and idem perna from via e 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.910
 for the street number we can obviously 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.709
 also have other information points 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.420
 interest to go to a city center 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.730
 the archive tells you city center and 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.769
 risks 100 cities to see how 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.590
 if we have the guide button the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.569
 navigator offers us three itineraries and there 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 also show on the map then I can 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.590
 choose if they want faster more 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.190
 short or compromise activate 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.020
 disable tolls 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.390
 the ferries etcetera etc. 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.600
 there is a navigator that works well 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.790
 always brought to its destination and has it 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.010
 always done in the best way 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.880
 always it worked very well but we go 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.120
 to the average average party a 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.160
 the radio part that works well maybe 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.040
 a little less sensitive than others 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.920
 read and try I see it because when 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.930
 others entered the underground garage 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.090
 readings keep me this radio signal 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.900
 he didn't keep it but he was in the streets 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.040
 we have not had everyday 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.890
 particular problems of course rds 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.859
 what settings with regards to 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.430
 the audio can also change the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.350
 ringtones when the phone rings 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.510
 now instead the streaming part 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.150
 musical 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:37.880
 we have so many possibilities if we 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.500
 we press the button sources like 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.140
 see we have the chance to go 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.460
 on the am fm radio on the sb sul 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.220
 bluetooth streaming or input only 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.200
 auxiliary a small problem I had 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.030
 found that when we connect two 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.440
 devices simultaneously as in this one 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.860
 moment we connected to the stick 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.060
 usb and the iphone we ca n't 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.700
 select one or the other because 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.860
 pressing usb we go to the cost of 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.720
 usb stick if we remove the 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.660
 USB pendrive 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.690
 we return to the list of sources 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.360
 going to usb the infotainment will go 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.950
 directly on the ipod 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.740
 if we have inserted the usb key 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.230
 and we connect the ipod ditto from usb goes to 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.300
 ipod then both together do not 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.740
 manage to manage if we press on 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.080
 album cover we go to 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.150
 view all 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.699
 albums that are inside the 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.629
 the iphone in this case the iphone of di 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.900
 luca 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:41.180
 let's go back and show you how 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.300
 the commands are replicated to a large extent 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.599
 even on the steering wheel where we have almost one 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.169
 left the volume here are on the right the 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.449
 possibility to change the various tracks 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.280
 with the list button we can enter 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.060
 directly in the list of all 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.240
 traces that are on the ipod and with 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.060
 the button with the left source 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.569
 we can change the source in in 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.780
 entrance 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.699
 now I activate the USB key that 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.680
 insert then we go to hear the 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.240
 audio quality with ours 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.090
 classic head song you have seen 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.729
 is automatically switched to USB 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.729
 we are on american mel travel volume 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:35.870
 then up to half the volume more or less 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.719
 15 and 16 we have no low problems there 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.430
 they are not very powerful overcoming 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.249
 that threshold then from 16 to 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.199
 top of the scale here are the lows 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:47.240
 then they begin to distort a lot 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.330
 a fourth of the good audio up to 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.839
 average volumes then lose the lows when 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.159
 let's raise the volume too much, I 'll talk about it 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:56.479
 bluetooth phone part instead 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:07:00.020
 let's see here on the display 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.309
 the reception and the battery quality is 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.199
 very good for us that we hear 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:04.759
 we feel very good others feel 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.680
 at city speed and when we start 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.870
 go on the highway the microphone does not 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.589
 always manages to capture all that 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.960
 what we say 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:15.139
 last thing how to show the display 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.839
 here in front of our eyes complete 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:20.360
 because it is a color LCD display gives us 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:23.599
 information on driving autonomy 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.830
 residual and instant consumption a trip 1 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.069
 a trip 2 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.919
 the song that is currently running e 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:32.509
 the information on the navigator this 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:37.249
 case I didn't enter a destination 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:38.810
 so give me this information for hd 

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:41.539
 magazine engines and for the term info of 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.749
 this 208 is all a greeting from Andrea 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:43.749
