so<00:01:05.909> simple<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.810> first<00:01:07.049> thought<00:01:07.320> you'll<00:01:07.500> have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so simple the first thought you'll have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
so simple the first thought you'll have
is<00:01:07.979> why<00:01:08.250> didn't<00:01:08.549> anybody<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> sooner

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
is why didn't anybody think of it sooner

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
is why didn't anybody think of it sooner
with<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.560> isometric<00:01:11.189> view<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.880> were<00:01:12.000> tasked

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
with an isometric view you were tasked

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
with an isometric view you were tasked
with<00:01:12.390> using<00:01:12.869> three<00:01:13.200> shapes<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:14.070> build

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
with using three shapes to build

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
with using three shapes to build
channels<00:01:14.729> mounds<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.900> build<00:01:16.110> reservoirs<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
channels mounds to build reservoirs and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
channels mounds to build reservoirs and
dams<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.850> order<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> trap<00:01:18.600> water<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.110> falls

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
dams in order to trap water that falls

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
dams in order to trap water that falls
from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> sky<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.909> make<00:01:21.060> things<00:01:21.270> complicated

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
from the sky to make things complicated

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
from the sky to make things complicated
pieces<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.470> falling<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.920> random<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.490> so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pieces are falling at random and so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
pieces are falling at random and so
you're<00:01:23.970> tasked<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.360> using<00:01:24.479> uppers<00:01:25.170> which

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you're tasked with using uppers which

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
you're tasked with using uppers which
raise<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> land<00:01:26.009> down<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.060> lower<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
raise the land down as which lower it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.800 
raise the land down as which lower it
and<00:01:27.780> blobs<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.439> water<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:28.890> vary<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.250> size<00:01:29.810> if

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and blobs of water which vary in size if

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
and blobs of water which vary in size if
you're<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.170> quick<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.799> skilled<00:01:32.130> enough<00:01:32.369> water

will overflow from the edges of the map

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.740 
will overflow from the edges of the map
and<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.520> water<00:01:35.790> meter<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.540> hand
