00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:23.170 

okay<00:00:14.750> so<00:00:15.750> let's<00:00:16.530> see<00:00:16.860> how<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.340> Tool<00:00:17.640> Works

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.190 

let's<00:00:24.180> go<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> very<00:00:25.590> close<00:00:25.860> and<00:00:27.200> because

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
let's go with a very close and because

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.620 
let's go with a very close and because
there's<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.739> edges<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.790> what<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
there's a lot of edges here we what I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
there's a lot of edges here we what I
have<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.020> do<00:00:31.169> it<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.790> very

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
have to do it just have to be very

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.360 
have to do it just have to be very
gentle<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> tools<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.190> can

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
gentle with them with the tools you can

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.229 
gentle with them with the tools you can
see<00:00:35.550> em<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.290> taking<00:00:37.290> quite<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> short<00:00:38.579> strokes

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
see em and taking quite a short strokes

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.740 
see em and taking quite a short strokes
with<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.110> brush<00:00:40.380> so<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:42.149> easy<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
with it with this brush so it's easy to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.710 
with it with this brush so it's easy to
avoid<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> pattern<00:00:43.830> I<00:00:46.610> think<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.880> where

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
avoid the pattern I think this is where

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.500 
avoid the pattern I think this is where
we<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.140> into

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.380 

sometimes<00:01:35.409> it's<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.709> it's<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.280> lot<00:01:36.429> of<00:01:36.579> fun<00:01:36.819> to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
sometimes it's a it's a lot of fun to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.509 
and all right we can like I said those
few<00:02:24.860> parts<00:02:25.340> would<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:26.000> very<00:02:26.209> boring<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.519> it's

and they keep going really really far
with<00:03:11.659> with<00:03:12.530> retouching<00:03:13.189> and<00:03:13.430> they<00:03:13.579> just<00:03:13.970> lose

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
with with retouching and they just lose

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.289 
with with retouching and they just lose
three-dimensional<00:03:15.709> shape<00:03:16.069> of<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.950> eye

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
three-dimensional shape of of the eye

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.439 
three-dimensional shape of of the eye
itself<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.139> doesn't<00:03:21.530> look<00:03:21.620> right<00:03:22.449> because

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
itself and it doesn't look right because

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.540 
itself and it doesn't look right because
I<00:03:23.480> either<00:03:24.609> three<00:03:25.609> dimensional

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.420 

three<00:03:29.550> dimensions<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.360> then<00:03:30.570> they<00:03:31.430> have

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
small indie I we remove those veins so

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190
