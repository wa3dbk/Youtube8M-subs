00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.350
 hello everyone today I bring you a sponge cake 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.600
 of delicious yogurt is very juicy for the 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.940
 carrying yogurt and it's also easy to 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.980
 to do is fast and very healthy because it does not 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.900
 I put butter so I hope that you 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.549
 encourage to do it and that only very rich 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 to make the yogurt cake 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.770
 we need 3 eggs we have separated the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.920
 yolks of the egg whites that now after 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.570
 we will assemble and we will use a yogurt 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.390
 natural 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.950
 the same measure of the yogurt teddy the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 we will use to calculate the rest 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.560
 of the ingredients then we will put 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 two measures of sugar 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.300
 we will put three measures of preparation for 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 biscuits that is a flour that carries 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 the yeast incorporated 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.829
 let's also put half a measure of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.290
 sunflower oil 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.150
 zest of two lemons 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.430
 juice of a lemon 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.510
 and also a little salt to ride 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.370
 the Clares 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 we put a pinch of salt to the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.030
 clear it is convenient that the egg is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.630
 room temperature because it gets up 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630
 better 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.560
 this enough point is not necessary 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.930
 that are very assembled it's just about 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.540
 air them so that the cake is 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.540
 more spongy we now take the sugar 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.640
 the sugar is 200 grams by which no 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.620
 wants to be using the measure of what 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.930
 has been going to add yogurt 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.780
 I tried to do this also with yogurt 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.230
 of lemon and with apple yogurt 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.360
 also very rich let's add a half 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.550
 glass of sunflower oil maybe a 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.920
 little more than half a glass 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.450
 actually and this cake is made with 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.360
 butter but I think it 's 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 make healthier sunflower oil 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.830
 let's now incorporate the juice of a 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.300
 lemon the zest of two lemons and the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.610
 flour that I have already told you is a 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.060
 prepared for sponge cake that we are going to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.060
 sieve 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.869
 sieving the flour is so that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.910
 there is no group and also so that 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.540
 air and be easier after the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.370
 sponge cake move always in the same 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.210
 direction to prevent the flour from 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.310
 wrap and stay in lumps 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.820
 the oven is already preheated to 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.160
 180 degrees if you use a flour that 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.800
 Do not be prepared biscuits 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.900
 as the flour are 250 grams what is 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.260
 use here you have to put a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.299
 About yeast chemistry 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 and tried to use a flour that is 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.980
 for confectionery is always going to be 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.370
 better than the flour that is used in the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.040
 kitchen to batter to make or isamel 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.940
 and now we are going to incorporate in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.940
 mounted keys 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.400
 and we will try to mix everything without 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.739
 that we are squashed too much in 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.549
 enveloping movements and slowly with 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.549
 a little patience 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.780
 This is the mass once the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.780
 clear mounted and incorporated in a 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.720
 mold that is removable with a piece 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.030
 of butter what we are going to do is 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.330
 grease it well by the base and by the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 walls 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.760
 You can also do it with a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.360
 vegetable margarine if you want to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.740
 butter and now we throw flour 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.460
 current flour does not need to be 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.890
 prepared sponge cake 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.550
 we are letting fall all over the mold 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.070
 so that it sticks well on the walls what 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.060
 that we over throw it and now 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.060
 let's take the dough 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.520
 and we go to the oven the cake takes 40 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.720
 minutes in the oven let's check if 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.840
 it is for that we puncture if the needle comes out 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.300
 clean is that the cake has come out 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.040
 clean, we have it ready, no 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.460
 we can unmold it until it is not 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.330
 cold because it would break us look what 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.330
 spongy 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.580
 Well, I hope you have it 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.070
 happened well with me and that I have 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.799
 served the recipe here in the kitchen and a 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.750
 smell that good or tell you good 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.750
 see you soon until another
