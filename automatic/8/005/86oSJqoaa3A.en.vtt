00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
with some fish food some chemicals in it

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.029 
with some fish food some chemicals in it
and<00:00:10.759> one<00:00:11.690> of<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.869> chemicals<00:00:12.259> and<00:00:12.409> it<00:00:12.469> was<00:00:12.619> easy

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
and one of the chemicals and it was easy

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.060 
and one of the chemicals and it was easy
balance<00:00:13.610> now<00:00:14.209> I<00:00:14.239> like<00:00:14.539> this<00:00:14.809> chemical<00:00:15.169> I've

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
balance now I like this chemical I've

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.829 
balance now I like this chemical I've
never<00:00:16.309> really<00:00:16.580> used<00:00:16.609> it<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:17.060> whole<00:00:17.269> lot<00:00:17.300> but<00:00:17.810> I

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:17.839 
never really used it a whole lot but I

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.870 
never really used it a whole lot but I
figured<00:00:18.259> I'd<00:00:18.380> give<00:00:18.589> it<00:00:18.619> a<00:00:18.769> shot

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
figured I'd give it a shot

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.599 
figured I'd give it a shot
I<00:00:19.990> just<00:00:20.990> was<00:00:21.169> kind<00:00:21.320> of<00:00:21.470> always<00:00:21.619> misinformed<00:00:22.490> of

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
I just was kind of always misinformed of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.779 
I just was kind of always misinformed of
what<00:00:22.699> it<00:00:22.789> actually<00:00:22.970> did<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.310> I<00:00:25.369> gave<00:00:25.429> it<00:00:25.699> a

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
what it actually did and so I gave it a

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.700 
what it actually did and so I gave it a
shot<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.300> what's<00:00:26.449> nice<00:00:26.689> is<00:00:26.929> I<00:00:27.019> never<00:00:27.199> realized

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
shot and what's nice is I never realized

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.130 
shot and what's nice is I never realized
that<00:00:28.009> um<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.730> did<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.179> much<00:00:29.359> in<00:00:29.599> such<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.779> little

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
that um it did so much in such a little

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.040 
that um it did so much in such a little
bottle<00:00:30.499> now<00:00:31.429> remember<00:00:31.909> this<00:00:32.029> isn't<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.570> water

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
bottle now remember this isn't a water

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.930 
bottle now remember this isn't a water
conditioner<00:00:33.649> this<00:00:34.190> isn't<00:00:34.489> going<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:34.699> take<00:00:34.820> the

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
conditioner this isn't going to take the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.080 
conditioner this isn't going to take the
chlorine<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.510> stuff<00:00:35.690> out<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:35.899> your<00:00:36.050> water<00:00:37.090> so

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
chlorine and stuff out of your water so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.229 
chlorine and stuff out of your water so
but<00:00:38.300> what<00:00:38.930> it<00:00:39.050> does<00:00:39.260> take<00:00:39.530> out<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:40.039> uh<00:00:40.239> it

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
but what it does take out is uh it

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.849 
but what it does take out is uh it
actually<00:00:41.359> helps<00:00:41.750> reduce<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.289> phosphate

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
actually helps reduce the phosphate

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.189 
actually helps reduce the phosphate
levels<00:00:43.219> which<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.579> always<00:00:43.760> nice<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.840> also

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
levels which is always nice and also

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.930 
levels which is always nice and also
helps<00:00:45.590> improve<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.920> water<00:00:46.160> quality<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.789> your

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
helps improve the water quality of your

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.709 
helps improve the water quality of your
tank<00:00:47.559> also<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.129> alkalinity<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.269> pH

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
tank also it is a alkalinity and pH

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.990 
tank also it is a alkalinity and pH
stabilizer<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.370> you're<00:00:52.489> not<00:00:52.609> going<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.879> have

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
stabilizer so you're not going to have

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500 
stabilizer so you're not going to have
any<00:00:53.179> sudden<00:00:54.519> basically<00:00:55.519> horrible<00:00:55.969> spikes<00:00:56.300> or

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
any sudden basically horrible spikes or

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.720 
any sudden basically horrible spikes or
anything<00:00:56.660> like<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.100> which<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.129> nice<00:00:58.429> because

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
anything like that which is nice because

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.060 
anything like that which is nice because
you<00:00:59.030> don't<00:00:59.239> want<00:00:59.480> a<00:00:59.750> pH<00:01:00.140> spike<00:01:00.500> even<00:01:00.859> just<00:01:00.980> a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
you don't want a pH spike even just a

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.639 
you don't want a pH spike even just a
little<00:01:01.100> bit<00:01:01.510> can<00:01:02.510> kill<00:01:02.719> your<00:01:02.870> fish<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.410> stress

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649

ten<00:02:25.250> gallons<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.960> know<00:02:27.080> if<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.290> have<00:02:27.440> 55

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
ten gallons you know if you have 55

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.560 
ten gallons you know if you have 55
gallon<00:02:28.280> tank<00:02:28.490> that's<00:02:28.760> five<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.420> half

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
gallon tank that's five and a half

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.030 
gallon tank that's five and a half
capfuls<00:02:29.780> definitely<00:02:30.620> not<00:02:30.740> hard<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.070> follow

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
capfuls definitely not hard to follow

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.280 
capfuls definitely not hard to follow
but<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.630> they<00:02:35.630> recommend<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.200> you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
but with this they recommend that you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.830 
but with this they recommend that you
change<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> water<00:02:36.860> every<00:02:37.010> six<00:02:37.520> months<00:02:37.940> at

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
change the water every six months at

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.550 
change the water every six months at
least<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.290> 50<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.680> 75%<00:02:40.160> water<00:02:41.120> change

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
least you have 50 to 75% water change

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.450 
least you have 50 to 75% water change
that<00:02:42.560> way<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.740> can<00:02:43.130> basically<00:02:44.000> contain<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
that way you can basically contain the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.530 
that way you can basically contain the
healthier<00:02:46.460> tank<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.240> that's<00:02:47.390> definitely

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
healthier tank so that's definitely

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.870 
healthier tank so that's definitely
really<00:02:47.870> important<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.380> remember<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.550> also

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
really important to remember and also

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.350 
really important to remember and also
don't<00:02:50.420> use<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.990> in<00:02:51.080> low<00:02:51.290> oxygen<00:02:51.950> conditions<00:02:52.430> so

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
don't use it in low oxygen conditions so

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.060 
don't use it in low oxygen conditions so
if<00:02:53.600> for<00:02:53.780> some<00:02:53.810> reason<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.530> an<00:02:54.650> overstock

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
if for some reason you have an overstock

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.940 
if for some reason you have an overstock
tank<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.020> don't<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.620> adequate

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
tank if you don't have the adequate

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.400 
tank if you don't have the adequate
filtration<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.030> if<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.170> added

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
filtration on it if you just added

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.320 
filtration on it if you just added
medicine<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> tank<00:03:01.550> then<00:03:01.970> that's<00:03:02.180> going

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
medicine to the tank then that's going

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.150 
medicine to the tank then that's going
to<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:03.110> reduce<00:03:03.290> some<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.890> them<00:03:04.010> will

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
to actually reduce some of them will

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.860 
to actually reduce some of them will
actually<00:03:04.430> reduce<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.910> oxygen<00:03:05.210> level<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
actually reduce the oxygen level in the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.960 
actually reduce the oxygen level in the
tanks<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.190> definitely<00:03:07.340> wouldn't<00:03:07.730> want<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
tanks so you definitely wouldn't want to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.360 
tanks so you definitely wouldn't want to
use<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.420> then<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.590> want<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.010> keep<00:03:10.160> that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
use that then so you want to keep that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.830 
use that then so you want to keep that
in<00:03:10.550> mind<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.480> keep<00:03:11.690> your

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
in mind just so you can keep your

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.150 
in mind just so you can keep your
healthy<00:03:12.170> fish<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.630> again<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.350> go<00:03:15.500> back<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
healthy fish and again to go back to the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.310 
healthy fish and again to go back to the
water<00:03:16.400> changes<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.780> reason<00:03:18.080> why<00:03:18.170> they

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
water changes the reason why they

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.960 
water changes the reason why they
recommend<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.430> use<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:19.940> a

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
recommend that is if you use this as a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.570 
recommend that is if you use this as a
regular<00:03:20.440> weekly<00:03:21.440> additive<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.250> your<00:03:22.370> tank

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
regular weekly additive to your tank

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.860 
regular weekly additive to your tank
that's<00:03:22.910> why<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.120> want<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.480> do<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.690> water

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
that's why you want to do the water

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.979 
that's why you want to do the water
changes<00:03:24.700> because<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.820> still<00:03:26.150> want<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.510> remove

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
changes because you still want to remove

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.010 
changes because you still want to remove
some<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.800> built-up<00:03:28.370> debris<00:03:29.180> fish<00:03:29.780> waste

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
some of the built-up debris fish waste

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.540 
some of the built-up debris fish waste
everything<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.070> maintain<00:03:31.220> that

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
everything like that to maintain that

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.260 
everything like that to maintain that
