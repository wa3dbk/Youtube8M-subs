that bear and son uses making this life
a<00:01:17.920> little<00:01:18.189> bit<00:01:18.369> more<00:01:18.579> expensive<00:01:18.819> and<00:01:19.210> off<00:01:20.170> but

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
a little bit more expensive and off but

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.080 
a little bit more expensive and off but
also<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:21.100> get<00:01:21.219> what<00:01:21.429> you<00:01:21.460> pay<00:01:21.579> for<00:01:21.939> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
also you get what you pay for the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.179 
also you get what you pay for the
quality<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.630> also<00:01:22.810> much<00:01:23.079> better<00:01:23.140> well<00:01:23.920> not

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
quality is also much better well not

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.010 
quality is also much better well not
much<00:01:24.429> better<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:24.939> a<00:01:25.090> little<00:01:25.479> bit<00:01:25.569> better<00:01:25.659> I'll

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
much better but a little bit better I'll

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.149 
much better but a little bit better I'll
say<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.539> blade<00:01:28.749> pretty<00:01:29.439> much<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.770> same<00:01:29.950> as

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
say so the blade pretty much the same as

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.349 
say so the blade pretty much the same as
the<00:01:30.280> bear<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:31.450> drop-point<00:01:32.079> design<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:33.359> hologram

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
right now I would trust the steel that

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.569 
right now I would trust the steel that
case<00:01:51.819> uses<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.719> at<00:01:53.619> least<00:01:53.950> if<00:01:54.189> not<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.369> little

uses and not to say that the bear knife
isn't<00:02:00.549> up<00:02:01.289> isn't<00:02:02.289> a<00:02:02.380> good<00:02:02.560> knife<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:03.039> still<00:02:03.850> a

good knife but this one is just a little
bit<00:02:05.619> better<00:02:07.110> soz<00:02:08.110> i<00:02:08.350> tell<00:02:08.530> handle<00:02:09.240> this

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
bit better soz i tell handle this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.920 
bit better soz i tell handle this
actually<00:02:10.899> feels<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.890> lot<00:02:12.160> better<00:02:12.599> less<00:02:13.599> slick

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
actually feels a lot better less slick

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.190 
actually feels a lot better less slick
than<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.650> right<00:02:14.890> handle<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.640> bear<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.200> so

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
pretty much all the same I have all the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.479 
pretty much all the same I have all the
same<00:02:41.739> points<00:02:42.190> as<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.970> Baron<00:02:43.330> son's<00:02:43.599> life<00:02:44.489> so

same points as the Baron son's life so

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.759 
same points as the Baron son's life so
if<00:02:45.879> you<00:02:46.569> want<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> see<00:02:47.019> what<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.260> think<00:02:47.590> about

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
if you want to see what I think about

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.110 
if you want to see what I think about
the<00:02:47.920> overall<00:02:48.160> design<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:48.940> watch

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the overall design of that just watch

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.089 
the overall design of that just watch
that<00:02:49.720> review<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.390> lock<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.840> better<00:02:53.440> on<00:02:53.709> this

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
that review the lock is better on this

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.430 
that review the lock is better on this
one<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.819> bear<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.030> son<00:02:55.330> there<00:02:56.019> is<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
one then the bear and son there is a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.490 
one then the bear and son there is a
little<00:02:56.890> bit<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.130> up<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.370> down<00:02:57.489> blade<00:02:57.790> play<00:02:58.060> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
little bit of up and down blade play and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.960 
little bit of up and down blade play and
a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.769> bit<00:02:59.860> of<00:02:59.920> side-to-side<00:03:00.250> blade<00:03:00.730> play

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
a little bit of side-to-side blade play

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
a little bit of side-to-side blade play
although<00:03:01.209> much<00:03:01.660> less<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
although much less so this is in the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.280 
although much less so this is in the
same<00:03:06.040> price<00:03:06.250> range<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.760> believe<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:07.930> about

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
same price range I believe this is about

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.100 
same price range I believe this is about
twenty<00:03:08.709> dollars<00:03:09.040> MSRP<00:03:09.670> but<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.329> course<00:03:10.360> you're

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
twenty dollars MSRP but of course you're

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.240 
twenty dollars MSRP but of course you're
going<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.319> be<00:03:11.440> able<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.680> find<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.980> much<00:03:12.220> cheaper

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
going to be able to find it much cheaper

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.520 
going to be able to find it much cheaper
than<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.879> but<00:03:13.569> like<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.840> said<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.049> little<00:03:14.170> bit

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
than that but like I said a little bit

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.589 
than that but like I said a little bit
more<00:03:14.650> expensive<00:03:14.920> than<00:03:15.640> my<00:03:15.970> bear<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.390> Sons

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
more expensive than my bear and Sons

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.339 
more expensive than my bear and Sons
walk<00:03:17.290> back<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.670> quality<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.120> this<00:03:19.329> is<00:03:19.569> better

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
walk back the quality on this is better

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.780 
walk back the quality on this is better
for<00:03:20.920> your<00:03:20.950> money<00:03:22.860> overall<00:03:23.860> it's<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.459> good<00:03:24.610> knife

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
for your money overall it's a good knife

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.430 
for your money overall it's a good knife
like<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.450> said<00:03:25.599> I<00:03:25.720> don't<00:03:25.930> have<00:03:26.049> much<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.410> say

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
like I said I don't have much to say

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.229 
like I said I don't have much to say
since<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.069> basically<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.609> exact<00:03:28.000> same

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
since it's basically the exact same

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.129 
since it's basically the exact same
design<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:31.079> Baron<00:03:32.079> son<00:03:32.260> knife<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:34.139> that's

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
design as the Baron son knife so that's

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.170 
design as the Baron son knife so that's
about<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.410> very<00:03:35.889> light<00:03:36.130> point<00:03:36.549> eight<00:03:36.760> ounces

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
about it very light point eight ounces

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.699 
about it very light point eight ounces
so<00:03:37.510> if<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.870> want<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.049> stick<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.380> your<00:03:38.410> keys

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
so if you want to stick it on your keys

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.490 
so if you want to stick it on your keys
that<00:03:39.280> would<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:39.459> good<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.900> that's<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.230> for<00:03:41.260> this

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
that would be good so that's it for this

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.099 
that would be good so that's it for this
probably<00:03:42.190> really<00:03:42.430> short<00:03:42.639> video<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.630> hope

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
probably really short video so I hope

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.020 
probably really short video so I hope
you<00:03:44.319> guys<00:03:44.380> enjoyed<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.639> will<00:03:45.670> see<00:03:45.970> you
