 a municipality that on the quarter the ad wavelength that made eureko celsius 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.969

 I am ready for you to be a member 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960

 h 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 that suggests to increase it even further 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.649
 so there will be a place with that note from their party 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.840
