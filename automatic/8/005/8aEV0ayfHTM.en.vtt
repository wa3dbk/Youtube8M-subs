about robotics in the consumer world is
that<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.610> often<00:00:55.880> focus<00:00:56.329> on<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.870> cutting<00:00:57.170> edge

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
that we often focus on the cutting edge

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.000 
Autobots these super cute little guys
actually<00:01:54.030> teach<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.870> valuable<00:01:55.290> lesson<00:01:55.590> in

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
actually teach a valuable lesson in

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.610 
actually teach a valuable lesson in
logical<00:01:56.910> sequencing<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.290> follow

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
logical sequencing so they follow

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.920 
logical sequencing so they follow
different<00:01:58.920> colors<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.550> lines<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.480> then<00:02:00.660> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
different colors of lines but then you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350

can<00:02:01.140> create<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.680> rules<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.220> follow<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.940> when

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
can create the rules they follow so when

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
can create the rules they follow so when
they<00:02:03.510> encounter<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> different<00:02:04.470> color<00:02:04.680> they

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
they encounter a different color they

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.430 
they encounter a different color they

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
of programming early on so that they

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
think the most important robot I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.630 
think the most important robot I
encountered<00:02:31.020> was<00:02:31.350> from<00:02:31.590> five<00:02:31.890> elements

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640

encountered was from five elements
robotics<00:02:33.300> because<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.110> let<00:02:34.350> me<00:02:34.380> carry<00:02:34.920> my<00:02:35.190> code

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
robotics because it let me carry my code

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
technology come down in price so that we

on now you might think some of the
robots<00:02:53.100> we've<00:02:53.280> covered<00:02:53.459> today<00:02:53.640> are<00:02:54.000> silly<00:02:54.330> or

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
robots we've covered today are silly or

coming<00:03:04.080> down<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.410> price<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.980> we're<00:03:05.190> finally

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
coming down in price so we're finally

getting to access something that used to

be bleeding edge research and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.820 
be bleeding edge research and
development<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.110> couple<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.410> years<00:03:10.590> ago

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830

this<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.640> how<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> future<00:03:12.450> happens<00:03:13.110> I'm

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
this is how the future happens I'm

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.470 
this is how the future happens I'm
really<00:03:14.010> excited<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.610> new<00:03:14.760> nose<00:03:14.940> maybe<00:03:15.300> at

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
really excited in the new nose maybe at

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.800 
really excited in the new nose maybe at
CES<00:03:15.870> 2016<00:03:16.820> finally<00:03:17.820> get<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.060> Robo<00:03:18.450> Butler

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
question for all of you guys if you
could<00:03:21.989> design<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.350> robot<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.800> be<00:03:22.890> very<00:03:23.190> own<00:03:23.400> what

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
could design a robot to be very own what

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.930 
could design a robot to be very own what
would<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.270> do

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
would it do

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.640 
would it do
