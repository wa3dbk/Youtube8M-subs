released in november of last year which

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.020 
released in november of last year which
is<00:00:56.640> 2012<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.800> far<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.340> found<00:00:59.609> three

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
is 2012 but so far I've found three

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
is 2012 but so far I've found three
images<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.199> only<00:01:01.350> leaked<00:01:01.800> images

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
images now these are only leaked images

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
images now these are only leaked images
so<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.760> saying<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
so I'm not saying that this is going to

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410 
so I'm not saying that this is going to
be<00:01:03.899> exactly<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> new<00:01:05.070> xbox<00:01:05.700> 720<00:01:06.090> looks

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
be exactly what the new xbox 720 looks

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450 
be exactly what the new xbox 720 looks
like<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.799> giving<00:01:08.040> us<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
like but I think this is giving us a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.960 
like but I think this is giving us a
pretty<00:01:08.700> good<00:01:08.820> idea<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> expect<00:01:10.560> from

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
pretty good idea on what to expect from

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.330 
pretty good idea on what to expect from
Microsoft<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.390> xbox<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.159> look

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.050 
the back of your console and the third
thing<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> top<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
thing on your right and on the top is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
thing on your right and on the top is
the<00:01:54.479> cooling<00:01:54.840> system<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.649> that's<00:01:55.770> probably

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the cooling system so that's probably

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
the cooling system so that's probably
going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.490> new<00:01:56.670> revamped<00:01:57.090> version<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
going to be a new revamped version and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.060 
going to be a new revamped version and
that's<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.040> good

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that's probably going to be really good

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.060 
that's probably going to be really good
for<00:01:59.670> your<00:02:00.360> cooling<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> keep<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.500> xbox

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
for your cooling and to keep your xbox

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.359 
for your cooling and to keep your xbox
720<00:02:02.840> pretty<00:02:03.840> cool<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.320> it'll<00:02:04.680> keep<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> so

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
720 pretty cool and it'll keep it so

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.219 
720 pretty cool and it'll keep it so
that<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> doesn't<00:02:05.880> overheat<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.899> should

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that it doesn't overheat which should

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.940 
that it doesn't overheat which should
thus<00:02:08.090> lessen<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.539> amount<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.170> times<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.709> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
thus lessen the amount of times that it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
thus lessen the amount of times that it
freezes<00:02:11.430> during<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.599> play<00:02:12.780> session<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.410> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
freezes during a play session and that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
freezes during a play session and that
sort<00:02:13.739> of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
sort of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640 
sort of
and<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.220> kind<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.760> thing<00:02:15.440> catching<00:02:16.440> myself

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and that kind of thing catching myself

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.410 
and that kind of thing catching myself
they're<00:02:17.069> almost<00:02:17.280> saying<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.760> again<00:02:17.849> why<00:02:18.239> do<00:02:18.300> I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
they're almost saying it again why do I

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
they're almost saying it again why do I
always<00:02:18.480> say<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.110> don't<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.860> need<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
always say it I don't know I need to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.449 
always say it I don't know I need to
stop<00:02:20.489> doing<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.910> anyways<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.770> bottom<00:02:23.130> left

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
stop doing it anyways on the bottom left

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.800 
stop doing it anyways on the bottom left
and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.000> right<00:02:24.120> there's<00:02:24.480> only<00:02:24.599> two

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
and then to the right there's only two

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.140 
and then to the right there's only two
things<00:02:25.020> there's<00:02:25.800> hidden<00:02:26.010> USB<00:02:26.489> slots<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.000> we

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
things there's hidden USB slots so we

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.070 
things there's hidden USB slots so we
saw<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.870> xbox<00:02:28.500> 360<00:02:29.390> slim<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
saw this on the xbox 360 slim and the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.720 
saw this on the xbox 360 slim and the
original<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.980> could<00:02:32.190> just<00:02:32.280> push<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> little

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
original you could just push a little

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.040 
original you could just push a little
thing<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:33.510> assuming<00:02:33.780> that's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
thing in and I'm assuming that's

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.960 
thing in and I'm assuming that's
probably<00:02:34.410> what<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.590> will<00:02:34.739> be<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> same<00:02:35.250> as

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
probably what it will be the same as

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.870 
probably what it will be the same as
well<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.540> look<00:02:36.750> there's<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> little<00:02:37.880> just

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
well if you look there's a little just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
well if you look there's a little just
above<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.360> little<00:02:39.720> hidden<00:02:40.170> USB<00:02:40.680> slot<00:02:40.980> thing

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
above that little hidden USB slot thing

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.650 
above that little hidden USB slot thing
you<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.930> little<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.940> green<00:02:45.269> things

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you can see for little like green things

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.509 
you can see for little like green things
which<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.500> our<00:02:46.680> guide<00:02:46.890> buttons<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
which we see on our guide buttons on the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.300 
which we see on our guide buttons on the
xbox<00:02:47.910> 360<00:02:48.569> controllers<00:02:49.080> now<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:50.069> believe

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
xbox 360 controllers now and I believe

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.680 
xbox 360 controllers now and I believe
that's<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.880> show<00:02:51.030> connectivity

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that's just going to show connectivity

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.170 
that's just going to show connectivity
for<00:02:51.900> each<00:02:52.130> controller<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.489> have<00:02:53.670> I'm

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
for each controller that you have I'm

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.640 
for each controller that you have I'm
surprised<00:02:54.660> they're<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:54.900> going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.440> any

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
surprised they're not going to have any

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.500 
surprised they're not going to have any
more<00:02:55.860> than<00:02:56.069> four<00:02:56.400> controllers<00:02:56.850> compatible

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
more than four controllers compatible

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720 
more than four controllers compatible
now<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.170> only<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.530> leaked<00:02:58.769> version<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
now this is only a leaked version of the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.490 
now this is only a leaked version of the
console<00:03:00.150> maybe<00:03:00.660> there<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.290> more

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
console maybe there will be more

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.160 
console maybe there will be more
compatibility<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.430> controllers<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.480> we're

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
compatibility for controllers but we're

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.710 
compatibility for controllers but we're
going<00:03:04.470> with<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.799> original<00:03:05.190> xbox<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.390> four

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
going with the original xbox the four

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.280 
going with the original xbox the four
sectors<00:03:07.380> kind<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.330> we<00:03:09.330> may<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.630> see<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.110> it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
sectors kind of a we may not see that it

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.039 
sectors kind of a we may not see that it
may<00:03:10.470> still<00:03:10.709> only<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.100> four<00:03:12.000> controllers<00:03:12.450> being

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
may still only be four controllers being

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.410 
may still only be four controllers being
able<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.440> get<00:03:13.680> connected<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.519> xbox<00:03:15.000> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
able to get connected to one xbox you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.360 
able to get connected to one xbox you
never<00:03:15.600> know<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.440> think<00:03:16.950> that's<00:03:17.130> probably

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
never know but I think that's probably

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.880 
never know but I think that's probably
what<00:03:17.670> we're<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.470> moving<00:03:19.470> over<00:03:19.739> to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
what we're going to have moving over to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.170 
what we're going to have moving over to
the<00:03:19.980> right<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.430> also<00:03:20.549> see<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> disk

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the right you can also see the disk

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.750 
the right you can also see the disk
drive<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.680> blu-ray<00:03:23.160> as<00:03:23.400> we

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
drive this is going to be blu-ray as we

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.789 
drive this is going to be blu-ray as we
have<00:03:23.940> rumored<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:25.019> don't<00:03:25.440> think<00:03:25.620> they're<00:03:25.709> going

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
have rumored I don't think they're going

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.009 
have rumored I don't think they're going
to<00:03:25.859> be<00:03:25.980> going<00:03:26.100> with<00:03:26.310> DVD<00:03:26.760> only<00:03:26.970> because<00:03:27.390> DVD<00:03:27.810> is

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
to be going with DVD only because DVD is

getting outdated and they're going to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.289 
getting outdated and they're going to
eventually<00:03:31.010> stop<00:03:32.010> making<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.760> producing

blu-ray<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.530> becoming<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.190> lot<00:03:38.340> more<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:41.040> it's

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
blu-ray is becoming a lot more like it's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.150 
blu-ray is becoming a lot more like it's
just<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.880> future<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.480> movies<00:03:43.350> basically<00:03:43.950> and

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
just the future of movies basically and

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.530 
just the future of movies basically and
so<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:44.760> we're<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.239> be<00:03:45.329> seeing

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
so I think we're going to be seeing

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.910 
so I think we're going to be seeing
blu-ray<00:03:46.940> devices<00:03:47.940> inside<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.840> xbox<00:03:49.290> although

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
blu-ray devices inside the xbox although

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.009 
blu-ray devices inside the xbox although
this<00:03:50.100> will<00:03:50.280> mean<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:50.940> Microsoft<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
this will mean for Microsoft to have to

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.660 
this will mean for Microsoft to have to
pay<00:03:52.170> shares<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.620> Sony<00:03:52.829> because<00:03:53.280> they're<00:03:53.459> going

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
pay shares to Sony because they're going

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.819 
pay shares to Sony because they're going
to<00:03:53.760> be<00:03:53.850> using<00:03:54.030> their<00:03:54.329> product<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.530> think

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
to be using their product but I think

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.170 
to be using their product but I think
it's<00:03:55.950> worth<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.579> think<00:03:56.819> it's<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.000> right

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it's worth it and I think it's the right

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.360 
it's worth it and I think it's the right
idea<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.170> right<00:03:58.319> trail<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.950> go<00:03:59.130> down

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
idea that in the right trail to go down

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.340 
idea that in the right trail to go down
if<00:03:59.609> they're<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.480> be<00:04:00.569> looking<00:04:00.600> at<00:04:01.049> better

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
if they're going to be looking at better

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.789 
if they're going to be looking at better
graphics<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.280> sort<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.840> know<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.319> I

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
graphics and that sort and you know so I

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.199 
graphics and that sort and you know so I
think<00:04:05.069> that's<00:04:05.310> going<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.609> just<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> best

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
think that's going to just be the best

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.319 
think that's going to just be the best
way<00:04:06.500> for<00:04:07.500> Microsoft<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.190> go<00:04:08.310> about<00:04:08.549> things<00:04:08.609> now

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
way for Microsoft to go about things now

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.710 
way for Microsoft to go about things now
the<00:04:09.390> last<00:04:09.720> thing<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.609> HDD<00:04:11.609> access<00:04:12.389> if<00:04:12.600> you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
the last thing is the HDD access if you

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.539 
the last thing is the HDD access if you
don't<00:04:12.870> know<00:04:12.959> what<00:04:13.019> HDD<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.739> that's<00:04:14.160> your<00:04:14.340> hard

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
don't know what HDD is that's your hard

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.969 
don't know what HDD is that's your hard
drive<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.540> basically<00:04:15.750> that's<00:04:16.590> going<00:04:16.919> to

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
drive and so basically that's going to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.610 
drive and so basically that's going to
be<00:04:17.130> your<00:04:17.729> whatever<00:04:18.660> they<00:04:18.930> end<00:04:19.049> up<00:04:19.169> doing<00:04:19.470> if

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
be your whatever they end up doing if

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.259 
be your whatever they end up doing if
it's<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.859> one<00:04:20.039> terabyte<00:04:20.250> two<00:04:20.669> terabyte<00:04:21.090> hard

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
it's a one terabyte two terabyte hard

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.600 
it's a one terabyte two terabyte hard
drive<00:04:21.510> which<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.810> 1000<00:04:22.620> or<00:04:22.710> 2000<00:04:23.250> gigabytes

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
drive which is 1000 or 2000 gigabytes

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.800 
drive which is 1000 or 2000 gigabytes

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.520 
for the xbox 720 the reveal should be
coming<00:05:28.440> out<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.940> III<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:29.970> are<00:05:30.300> at<00:05:30.479> e3<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.050> believe

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
coming out in III I are at e3 I believe

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.680 
coming out in III I are at e3 I believe
that's<00:05:32.430> what<00:05:32.610> it's<00:05:32.729> rumored<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.210> come<00:05:33.360> out<00:05:33.419> at

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
that's what it's rumored to come out at

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.740 
that's what it's rumored to come out at
and<00:05:34.340> I<00:05:35.340> think<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:36.120> way<00:05:36.210> they're<00:05:36.390> doing<00:05:36.539> it

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
and I think the way they're doing it

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.480 
and I think the way they're doing it
with<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.320> whole<00:05:37.500> sleek<00:05:37.830> design<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
with the whole sleek design and the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.610 
with the whole sleek design and the
rounded<00:05:39.120> edges<00:05:39.419> they're<00:05:39.900> kind<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.169> going<00:05:40.440> back

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
rounded edges they're kind of going back

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.420 
rounded edges they're kind of going back
to<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.890> basics<00:05:41.370> where<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.950> Xbox<00:05:43.950> box<00:05:44.160> was

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
to the basics where the Xbox box was

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.380 
to the basics where the Xbox box was
just<00:05:44.700> a<00:05:45.620> mountable<00:05:46.620> thing<00:05:46.950> on<00:05:47.760> your<00:05:47.970> desk<00:05:48.180> to

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
just a mountable thing on your desk to

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.690 
just a mountable thing on your desk to
lay<00:05:48.479> out<00:05:48.600> flat<00:05:48.810> where<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.410> xbox<00:05:49.800> 360<00:05:50.430> you

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
lay out flat where the xbox 360 you

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.600 
lay out flat where the xbox 360 you
could<00:05:50.880> go<00:05:51.419> both<00:05:51.660> ways<00:05:51.900> up<00:05:52.140> upwards<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.010> like

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
could go both ways up upwards and like

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.870 
could go both ways up upwards and like
vertically<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.180> horizontally<00:05:54.410> now<00:05:55.610> this<00:05:56.610> may

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
vertically and horizontally now this may

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.480 
vertically and horizontally now this may
mean<00:05:57.090> that<00:05:57.389> like<00:05:58.080> as<00:05:58.350> you<00:05:58.560> can<00:05:58.710> see<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.190> stand

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
mean that like as you can see the stand

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.580 
mean that like as you can see the stand
is<00:05:59.729> going<00:05:59.910> to<00:05:59.970> be<00:06:00.060> there<00:06:00.270> but<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.139> sleek

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
is going to be there but the sleek

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.440 
is going to be there but the sleek
design<00:06:01.919> it<00:06:02.220> looks<00:06:02.490> really<00:06:02.789> cool<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.150> rounded

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
design it looks really cool the rounded

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.270 
design it looks really cool the rounded
edges<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:03.840> that<00:06:03.960> sort<00:06:04.139> of<00:06:04.169> thing<00:06:04.229> so<00:06:04.919> maybe

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
edges and that sort of thing so maybe

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.940 
edges and that sort of thing so maybe
they<00:06:05.820> they<00:06:06.210> might<00:06:06.419> go<00:06:07.080> with<00:06:07.229> this<00:06:07.410> kind<00:06:07.860> of

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
they they might go with this kind of

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.640 
they they might go with this kind of
design<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.700> never<00:06:08.880> know<00:06:08.990> it<00:06:09.990> looks<00:06:10.229> like<00:06:10.320> in

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
