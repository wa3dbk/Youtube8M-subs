00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.590
 your topic is not sponsored by group 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 create better ideas for cooking 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.949
 fight more 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.410
 same now on your subject I'm not going to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.410
 prepare a beef broth 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 in singing they will see or cooked beef as 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 it's been in other places I've made one 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.600
 previously but this is very different 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.580
 it's much richer and other techniques like that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 what are you going to see I want to send you greetings 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.550
 cordials to israel sandoval and mayra 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.090
 hernandez from here of low tijuana 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.540
 california also to leo edges eight of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.589
 tijuana lowers california to him if there is 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.519
 Avalos from Peru and also Cecilia 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.470
 dávila 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.160
 Frankfurt also the dog so this 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160
 what we are going to occupy 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.950
 because here I have a bolus but we must 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.770
 do here I have bone with each bone 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.250
 with meat and a lot of nerve are two kilos and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.680
 we're going to make a beef broth 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.509
 different from what we've done all 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.250
 we have the oven preheated to 180 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.340
 degrees and we're going to bake them 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.300
 first to get all the flavor 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.680
 rich that has the bone with the nerve 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.680
 only in the oven 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.149
 and we're going to let it get golden 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.060
 golden 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 the talent 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.060
 these are the ingredients 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.340
 because this side of here we had already 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.009
 that is the bone he is baked 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.190
 I already told you how to do it on this side 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.140
 I have one kilo 700 grams of chamberí tea 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.700
 see how it is less known others 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.410
 in other places but in tijuana 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.260
 And here we have sliced corn on the cob 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.740
 and here I have a cabbage a piece 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.630
 cabbage big carrot zucchini one 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.510
 head of garlic nothing more we bring you what 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.870
 of above and peeled chayote is removed 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.760
 the seed here we have onion cambray 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.620
 from this side of cambrai view we are going to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.450
 put because it is richer and potatoes 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.450
 cambray also of the small potatoes 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.240
 whole so a split onion plus the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.370
 top part that has the tail 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.080
 this where some whips here the green beans 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.080
 tie them with the leaves of them 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.480
 corn will be called so that they are not 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.150
 there are swimming everywhere all 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.450
 here they remain small and we can 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.990
 give portions of two or three 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.200
 dish and here I have chickpea this chickpea 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.540
 you can already there are two options one what 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.730
 put to soak all night or if not 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.460
 about two hours before they can serve water 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.430
 you miss and lids and old says 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:23.130
 early to be faster 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.890
 and a little black peppercorns 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.450
 because in a pot we put the one that is the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.000
 water has to be cold we are going to 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.040
 start from scratch add-ons we put 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 onion garlic 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.500
 let's put them pepper 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.590
 Lets put 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.590
 is that the corn 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.880
 year 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.880
 let's put the chambéry this too 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.070
 and once 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:08.020
 we will do this preparation to 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.020
 fire well short well fine short and also 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.620
 we are going to cover it 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.750
 and we're going to let it be simmering 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.750
 little short fire and then we perform 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.420
 we are going to organize 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.350
 still no grass 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:37.010
 we have rather short but it left him 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.010
 the black foam and that we are going to remove 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.590
 all the black foam we are going to remove 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360
 we go back again 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.620
 and from here we're going to add some salt 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.049
 salt in grain 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.720
 a little bit this time 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.720
 we come back 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.880
 let's make all the meat 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.270
 everyone a little bit hard 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.740
 but still a little 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.740
 let's give the corn 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.640
 do it a little longer to be able to take 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.640
 the other ingredients 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.610
 A) Yes 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.610
 why again 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.870
 the meat is already 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.870
 he's already talking about here 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.440
 chickpea 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.250
 the chickpea this already with what 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.570
 that we gave him in the with the hot water 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.570
 it was precocious and not 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.400
 we put green beans 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.440
 watch out 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.129

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.199
 the carrot 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.199
 I fight that the zucchini 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.820
 the only thing that we are going to leave pending 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.560
 for the last one is cabbage and 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.889
 scallions 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.889
