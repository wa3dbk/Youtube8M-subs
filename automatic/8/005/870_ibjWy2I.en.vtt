I'm gonna drill a hole really anywhere

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400 
I'm gonna drill a hole really anywhere
on<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> ball<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.230> really

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
on the on the ball and all you really

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.889 
on the on the ball and all you really
need<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> started<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.149> didn't<00:00:42.780> go

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
need to do is get it started I didn't go

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.529 
need to do is get it started I didn't go
all<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.230> down<00:00:43.579> because<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.300> will

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
all the way down because then this will

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.190 
all the way down because then this will
screw<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.350> easily<00:00:47.719> there<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.840> go

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
screw in very easily there you go

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
screw in very easily there you go
the<00:00:49.950> plan<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> use<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:51.690> golf<00:00:51.989> tees

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the plan here is to use these golf tees

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.760 
the plan here is to use these golf tees
and<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:53.969> them<00:00:54.149> around<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> golf<00:00:58.260> ball<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and to put them around the golf ball to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.639 
and to put them around the golf ball to
create<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.129> Sun<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
create a Sun and that you can use this

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.560 
create a Sun and that you can use this
if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> outside<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.420> can

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
if you want to have it outside you can

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.080 
if you want to have it outside you can
use<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.920> e6000<00:01:04.920> glue<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.580> should<00:01:05.909> hold

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
use the e6000 glue and that should hold

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
use the e6000 glue and that should hold
it<00:01:06.270> forever<00:01:07.729> or<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.210> you're<00:01:09.689> gonna<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it forever or if you're gonna have it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
it forever or if you're gonna have it
inside<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.619> ahead<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> glue<00:01:11.280> gun<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
inside go ahead and use a glue gun that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.490 
inside go ahead and use a glue gun that
tends<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.750> bit<00:01:12.900> quicker<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
tends to be a little bit quicker and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
tends to be a little bit quicker and
easier<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.310> gonna<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.210> for

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
easier and I'm gonna do that just for

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
easier and I'm gonna do that just for
the<00:01:15.450> sake<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:19.049> project<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the sake of of the project to get it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.810 
the sake of of the project to get it
done<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.900> I'm<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> hot<00:01:22.799> glue<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
done so I'm gonna take the hot glue and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.289 
done so I'm gonna take the hot glue and
again<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.479> doing<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> e6000<00:01:26.299> take

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
again if you're doing the e6000 take

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.910 
again if you're doing the e6000 take
that<00:01:27.509> instead<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.080> whatever<00:01:28.350> glue<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> prefer

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
that instead or whatever glue you prefer

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:41.620 
that instead or whatever glue you prefer
start<00:01:31.920> placing<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> golf<00:01:34.920> tees<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.430> here

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.050 

then<00:01:42.380> I'm<00:01:42.500> gonna<00:01:42.619> going<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.430> guess<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
then I'm gonna going to guess on the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.870 
then I'm gonna going to guess on the
spacing<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.130> really<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:49.520> know<00:01:49.700> how<00:01:49.820> many

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
spacing so I really don't know how many

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.719 
spacing so I really don't know how many
I<00:01:50.149> can<00:01:50.479> fit<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.409> if<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.560> give<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:51.920> little<00:01:52.189> extra

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
I can fit so if I give it a little extra

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.779 
I can fit so if I give it a little extra
room<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.180> between<00:01:54.070> then<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.429> kind<00:01:55.640> of

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
room in between then I can kind of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.840 
room in between then I can kind of
scooch<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.689> there<00:01:56.840> if<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.079> need<00:01:57.259> to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
scooch it here and there if I need to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.249 
scooch it here and there if I need to
here<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.030> with<00:01:59.240> all<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.810> golf<00:02:00.049> tees

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
here it is with all of the golf tees

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.020 
here it is with all of the golf tees
attached<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:04.340> just<00:02:04.549> gonna<00:02:04.670> take<00:02:04.909> it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
attached and now I'm just gonna take it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.120 
attached and now I'm just gonna take it
outside<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.539> I'm<00:02:06.020> gonna<00:02:06.200> spray-paint<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.979> a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
outside and I'm gonna spray-paint it a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.820 
outside and I'm gonna spray-paint it a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
painted and ready to go and you can hang

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.500 
painted and ready to go and you can hang
this<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.580> window<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.239> hang<00:02:14.420> this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
this in a window you can hang this

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.910 
this in a window you can hang this
outside<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.410> if<00:02:15.500> you're<00:02:15.620> gonna<00:02:15.709> use<00:02:15.860> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
outside and if you're gonna use it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.130 
outside and if you're gonna use it
outside<00:02:16.160> again<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.790> would<00:02:16.940> use<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.690> stronger

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
outside again I would use the stronger

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
outside again I would use the stronger
glue<00:02:18.349> not<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.890> hot<00:02:19.069> glue<00:02:19.310> but<00:02:19.549> if<00:02:19.610> you're
