00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.229
 antiviral antioxidants 19 that are 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.060
 all the fruit and vegetables that are placed 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 well a little next to those rich in 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 vitamin that is the vitamin to the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.330
 vitamin that we really need now 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.479
 wind we can eat a lot salty with 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.280
 Israel 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.280
 lycopene we can also eat many 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:41.830
 like the oils 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.930
 and then as we saw last week 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.229
 that you gave us is a wonderful 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.180
 exposed we can take advantage of it for 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.330
 exfoliate us because the recommended 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.820
 before making an exposure to the sun is 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.670
 one month before each week exfoliate 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.159
 our body and our face with one or 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.159
 twice that is free of the cells 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.930
 all this because it is already 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.440
 then for this they have brought it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.210
 carrot macerated that this already knows 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.720
 As we have seen, it is important 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.390
 eternity this is very rich in vitamin 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.330
 apart from that he will provide us with all the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.370
 nutrients is also another one gored 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.070
 natural 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.950
 however they leave it to the skin as a 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.770
 conventional self-tanner so 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.130
 could enter a little bit not in a tone mode 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.080
 orange let's say exact after I've 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.180
 also brought rosehip in the rose 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.070
 Mosqueta is very rich in vitamin C and 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.410
 is very well balanced at the level of 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.930
 essential fatty acids 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.520
 6 basically and then has brought oils 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.920
 essential that to me personally I 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.410
 they love in cosmetics that are both the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.410
 geranium essential oil like that of 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 carrot not confused confused of 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.190
 vegetable oil and carrot 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.739
 essentials 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.260
 this is a maceration this is a 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.630
 very different distillation but to me the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.580
 combination of the two the line but to 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.580
 I love it very much 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.140
 so if you think 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.810
 saying what in the endorsement of view of 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.569
 Payment with exact are new and much more 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.330
 they are good we already know that a spoonful 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.640
 are ten milliliters we could get 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.890
 again let's do is put 20 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.410
 milliliters of agreement 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.240
 I'm going 20 milliliters, we're almost there 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.670
 in love so nice and he is no longer 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.830
 to suspect the exact sun dollars a 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.110
 solar species that we most put the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.300
 we passed that we put 10 milliliters of 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.300
 agreement 10 milliliters to mosqueta 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:12.239
 also that many of you because 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:14.970
 the others are cold and the quality that more 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.940
 then we would put four drops of 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.510
 Carrot essential oil towards a 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.450
 radiant skin one 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.410
 34 more in two drops of oil 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.180
 essential of the year very well 12 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.700
 there are people but you know anti that can 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.250
 start putting essential oils 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.910
 first because they are more valuable 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.910
 adhesive 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.450
 and we will put it in this jar 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.450
 a sausage 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.139
 and that of flowers comes out very 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:16.020
 funny 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:16.020
 good is good 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.070
 It is very important to mix the oils 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.140
 essentials and explain how it is 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.300
 you see how pretty it has been left 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.860
 precious precious then we put on 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.860
 a little two or three drops 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.960
 and then we apply it 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.009
 everywhere as we always say 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.009
 without forgetting the neckline 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.710
 Well, so far we hope that 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.440
 you liked this recipe to care 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.290
