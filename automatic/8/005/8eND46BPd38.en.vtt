00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.780
 and procedures for packing a poly 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.700
 by means of thermally shrinkable paper 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.450
 then the first thing we need is 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.340
 the thermally shrinkable paper 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.340
 comes double 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.939
 we also require 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.939
 I see a heat gun 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 we are going to continue to make a pact 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.180
 then we cut the paper to size 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.520
 looking for three or four of us 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.040
 centimeters on each side so you can 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.040
 be manipulated or handled the corners 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.620
 Hahaha 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.040
 we try as long as the union remains in 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.440
 parts where they are not very visible 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.620
 for customers 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.620
 where the paper meets the two corners 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.000
 take off we unite the parts with tape 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.000
 so that it is 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 and better punching is the time to pass the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.040
 heat gun 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 ah 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 and then I 'm so attached to 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.879
 corners attached with tape 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.140
 we are going to proceed to pass it and solÃ¡ de 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.849
 hot 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
 we will always start with the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:32.160
 lateral 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.160
 so that the gun 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.490
 German take the paper on the sides and 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.600
 no less wrinkles 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.600
 in this part 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.650
 note how they are tempering and doing 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.180
 that the product 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 that like nine 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.620
 it is in this way that the pool remains and a 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.620
 once reviewed by the technician 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.999
 and repackage we proceed 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.999
 to the bed 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.849
 those that have gone down in the cop and 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.849
 additionally a sticker was designed 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.349
 where is the logo of us dynamic 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.670
 and it has some letters where it says control 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.819
 of quality 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.900
 this is a sticker adhesion taken off in 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.900
 a part of the bed 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.270
 and it is in this way 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.270
 that our product is ready 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.770
 to be offered to our customers
