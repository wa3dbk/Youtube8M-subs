00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
I got this one was because of one of the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
I got this one was because of one of the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
e mod in the 10 but the e mod just

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
e mod in the 10 but the e mod just
wasn't<00:00:43.649> available<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> color<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
time I ordered it so I thought you know

time I ordered it so I thought you know
what<00:00:47.690> who<00:00:48.690> cares<00:00:48.750> I'll<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.559> ahead<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
what who cares I'll just go ahead and

get this one the length of pool between
the<00:00:52.980> e<00:00:53.010> mod<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> mod<00:00:53.940> stock<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.860> two

the e mod and the mod stock is about two

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.729 
the e mod and the mod stock is about two
inches<00:00:55.890> difference<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.840> shoulder<00:00:58.530> pad
