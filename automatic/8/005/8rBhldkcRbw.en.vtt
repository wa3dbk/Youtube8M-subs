for one hour and then we're gonna switch

it after one hour to 118 degrees so that
it<00:01:08.810> stays<00:01:08.990> wrong<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:10.640> can<00:01:10.880> turn<00:01:11.060> this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
it stays wrong so now we can turn this

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.940 
it stays wrong so now we can turn this
off<00:01:11.360> because<00:01:11.780> these<00:01:11.960> have<00:01:12.200> been<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.530> here<00:01:12.740> for

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
off because these have been you here for

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.750 
off because these have been you here for
about<00:01:13.160> 10<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.000> 12<00:01:14.240> hours<00:01:14.920> these<00:01:15.920> nuts<00:01:16.400> will

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
about 10 to 12 hours these nuts will

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.750 
about 10 to 12 hours these nuts will
last<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.540> long<00:01:17.930> time<00:01:17.960> because<00:01:18.500> they're<00:01:18.830> dry<00:01:19.310> and

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
last a long time because they're dry and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.080 
last a long time because they're dry and
they<00:01:20.600> are<00:01:20.840> totally<00:01:21.550> activated<00:01:22.550> as<00:01:22.700> far<00:01:22.970> as

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
they are totally activated as far as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.660 
they are totally activated as far as
their<00:01:23.240> nutritional<00:01:23.990> potential<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.890> your

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
their nutritional potential and your

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.170 
their nutritional potential and your
ability<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.270> digest<00:01:26.960> them<00:01:27.729> but<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.850> idea<00:01:28.880> is

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
ability to digest them but the idea is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.640 
ability to digest them but the idea is
to<00:01:29.300> have<00:01:29.420> them<00:01:29.540> completely<00:01:29.990> crunchy<00:01:30.530> and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
to have them completely crunchy and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.820 
to have them completely crunchy and
completely<00:01:31.010> dry<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.670> completely<00:01:35.030> delicious

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
completely dry and completely delicious

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.290 
completely dry and completely delicious
so<00:01:36.830> now<00:01:37.100> we're<00:01:37.280> going<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.490> make<00:01:37.670> these<00:01:37.850> into<00:01:38.090> a

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
so now we're going to make these into a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.780 
so now we're going to make these into a
butter<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.380> can<00:01:39.530> use<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.740> Vitamix<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:40.610> I'm

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
butter you can use a Vitamix which I'm

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.550 
butter you can use a Vitamix which I'm
using<00:01:41.000> here<00:01:41.390> or<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:41.930> can<00:01:42.080> use<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.259> food

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
using here or you can use a food

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.200 
using here or you can use a food
processor<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:46.100> want<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.369> make<00:01:46.520> sure<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:47.060> you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
processor you want to make sure that you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.520 
processor you want to make sure that you
feel<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> sides<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.200> doesn't<00:01:48.380> get

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
feel the sides and that it doesn't get

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.650 
feel the sides and that it doesn't get
overheated<00:01:49.190> because<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.030> Vitamix<00:01:50.390> is<00:01:50.509> such<00:01:50.630> a

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
overheated because the Vitamix is such a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.930 
overheated because the Vitamix is such a
powerful<00:01:51.080> motor<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:52.040> can<00:01:52.310> overheat<00:01:52.910> very

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
powerful motor it can overheat very

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.969 
powerful motor it can overheat very
quickly<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.750> then<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.530> won't<00:01:54.680> have<00:01:54.740> raw

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
quickly and then you won't have raw

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.100 
quickly and then you won't have raw
foods<00:01:55.280> anymore<00:01:55.580> after<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.509> 12<00:01:56.750> hours<00:01:56.900> you

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
foods anymore after the 12 hours you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.680 
foods anymore after the 12 hours you
spent<00:01:57.380> dehydrating<00:01:57.920> them<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.190> 180<00:01:58.700> degrees<00:01:59.119> so

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
spent dehydrating them on 180 degrees so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.270 
spent dehydrating them on 180 degrees so
here<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.259> consistency<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.160> are

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
here is the consistency that we are

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.279 
here is the consistency that we are
looking<00:02:01.610> for<00:02:01.910> it's<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.390> little<00:02:02.690> oily<00:02:02.929> but<00:02:03.170> as

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
looking for it's a little oily but as

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.900 
looking for it's a little oily but as
you<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.560> see<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.009> little<00:02:04.280> drier<00:02:04.610> than

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
you can see it's a little drier than

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.730 
you can see it's a little drier than
your<00:02:05.060> average<00:02:05.240> nut<00:02:05.720> butter<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.200> that's

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
your average nut butter and that's

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.580 

this<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.210> exactly<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.080> consistency<00:04:30.560> I

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590

this is exactly like the consistency I

started<00:04:32.720> with<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.110> similar<00:04:33.349> it's<00:04:34.039> really

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
started with it's similar it's really

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.070 
started with it's similar it's really
thick<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.729> creamy<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.240> doesn't<00:04:35.509> have<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.659> super

thick and creamy it doesn't have a super
strong<00:04:36.440> flavor<00:04:37.419> it's<00:04:38.419> kind<00:04:38.750> of

strong flavor it's kind of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.990

in<00:04:39.569> its<00:04:39.990> creaminess<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.889> it's<00:04:41.340> sour<00:04:41.669> because

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
in its creaminess and it's sour because

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.990 
in its creaminess and it's sour because
it's<00:04:42.270> fermented<00:04:42.810> now<00:04:43.680> as<00:04:44.009> we<00:04:44.190> know<00:04:44.220> nuts<00:04:44.819> are

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
it's fermented now as we know nuts are

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.610 
it's fermented now as we know nuts are
hard<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.330> digest<00:04:45.539> when<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.080> soak<00:04:46.350> them<00:04:46.470> they

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
hard to digest when you soak them they

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.499 
hard to digest when you soak them they
become<00:04:46.830> easier<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.370> digest<00:04:47.759> but<00:04:47.880> anything<00:04:48.479> you

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
become easier to digest but anything you

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.900 
become easier to digest but anything you
ferment<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.259> easiest<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.800> digest<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.759> this

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
ferment is the easiest to digest so this

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.520 
ferment is the easiest to digest so this
is<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> wonderful<00:04:51.660> health<00:04:51.900> product<00:04:52.319> and
