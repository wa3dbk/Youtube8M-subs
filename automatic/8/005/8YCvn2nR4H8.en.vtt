10<00:01:02.559> inches<00:01:02.830> long<00:01:03.070> I<00:01:03.930> remember<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.080> one<00:01:05.290> of

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
10 inches long I remember that one of

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.899 
10 inches long I remember that one of
the<00:01:05.470> scraps<00:01:05.740> that<00:01:05.950> were<00:01:06.040> cut<00:01:06.250> out<00:01:06.280> happened<00:01:06.850> to

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
the scraps that were cut out happened to

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.870 
the scraps that were cut out happened to
be<00:01:07.060> 10<00:01:07.360> inches<00:01:07.630> long<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.710> scrap<00:01:09.160> is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
be 10 inches long and so that scrap is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.670 
be 10 inches long and so that scrap is
what<00:01:10.120> will<00:01:10.210> be<00:01:10.300> used<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.630> make<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:11.020> one<00:01:11.320> and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
what will be used to make this one and

of course the other scrap will be used

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.050 
of course the other scrap will be used
to<00:01:13.480> make<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.870> one<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.100> we've<00:01:15.640> used<00:01:15.850> up

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
what I will do is I'll set the scribe to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:56.190 
what I will do is I'll set the scribe to
one-inch<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:46.130> Mark<00:02:50.109> three<00:02:51.109> of<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.290> sides

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
this is this is gonna be bent up at a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:19.690 
this is this is gonna be bent up at a
winnings<00:03:02.930> flange

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.979 

now<00:03:20.700> for<00:03:20.939> this<00:03:21.000> next<00:03:21.060> piece<00:03:21.540> which<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.900> the

now for this next piece which is the
10-inch<00:03:22.409> all<00:03:22.890> we<00:03:23.069> do<00:03:23.219> is<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.760> one<00:03:24.030> inch<00:03:24.180> flange

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
10-inch all we do is the one inch flange

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:38.209 
10-inch all we do is the one inch flange
Oh<00:03:32.150> that'll<00:03:33.150> fit<00:03:33.359> right<00:03:33.750> there<00:03:37.010> okay<00:03:38.010> while

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:38.219 
Oh that'll fit right there okay while

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.670 
Oh that'll fit right there okay while
the<00:03:38.400> camera<00:03:38.790> was<00:03:38.819> off<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.389> did<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.349> ahead<00:03:40.469> and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the camera was off I did go ahead and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.069 
the camera was off I did go ahead and
make<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:41.819> inch<00:03:41.969> scribe<00:03:42.299> here<00:03:42.569> forgot<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
make it one inch scribe here forgot to

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.240 
make it one inch scribe here forgot to
mention<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.470> while<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> camera<00:03:44.069> was<00:03:44.099> on

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
mention that while the camera was on

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.479 
mention that while the camera was on
you'll<00:03:45.239> see<00:03:45.269> how<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.629> fitting<00:03:46.169> looks<00:03:46.439> now<00:03:47.280> in

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
you'll see how this fitting looks now in

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.069 
you'll see how this fitting looks now in
bending<00:03:47.849> this<00:03:48.000> up<00:03:48.269> if<00:03:48.510> you're<00:03:48.689> going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:48.989> it

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
bending this up if you're going to do it

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.229 
bending this up if you're going to do it
on<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.260> brake<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.919> have<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.280> bend<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.879> side

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
on the brake you have to bend one side

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.379 
on the brake you have to bend one side
the<00:03:52.049> end<00:03:52.260> then<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> other<00:03:53.549> side<00:03:53.879> if<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.180> try

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
the end then the other side if you try

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.119 
the end then the other side if you try
bending<00:03:54.569> both<00:03:54.870> sides<00:03:55.169> at<00:03:55.349> once<00:03:55.379> then<00:03:55.950> doing

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
bending both sides at once then doing

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.129 
bending both sides at once then doing
the<00:03:56.340> end<00:03:56.519> you're<00:03:57.239> gonna<00:03:57.389> have<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.659> do<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.930> end

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
the end you're gonna have to do the end

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.709 
the end you're gonna have to do the end
by<00:03:58.409> hand<00:03:58.739> on<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.609> heavy<00:03:59.819> gauge<00:04:00.060> stuff<00:04:00.359> it

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 
by hand on this heavy gauge stuff it

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.690 
by hand on this heavy gauge stuff it
isn't<00:04:01.139> easy<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.379> get<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> nice<00:04:01.889> sharp<00:04:02.219> bend<00:04:02.519> by

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
isn't easy to get a nice sharp bend by

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.539 
isn't easy to get a nice sharp bend by
hand<00:04:02.939> so<00:04:03.689> if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.079> do<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.040> first<00:04:05.250> side

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
hand so if you just do the first side

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.000 
hand so if you just do the first side
second<00:04:06.090> then<00:04:06.269> third<00:04:06.569> then<00:04:07.469> you'll<00:04:07.650> be<00:04:07.769> able<00:04:07.829> to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
second then third then you'll be able to

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.830 
second then third then you'll be able to
do<00:04:08.159> it<00:04:10.760> now<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.819> can<00:04:12.000> see<00:04:12.180> how<00:04:12.329> this<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.689> going

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
do it now you can see how this is going

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:24.170 
do it now you can see how this is going
to<00:04:12.930> fit<00:04:13.169> in<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:20.310> once<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:22.310> once<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.490> all

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
to fit in and once is once is all

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.629 
to fit in and once is once is all
together<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:25.680> will<00:04:25.889> Bank<00:04:26.070> up<00:04:26.220> our<00:04:26.460> heat

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
together this will Bank up our heat

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.029 
together this will Bank up our heat
exchanger<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.360> then<00:04:28.080> we'll<00:04:28.199> get<00:04:28.289> into<00:04:28.500> how

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
exchanger and then we'll get into how

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.060 
exchanger and then we'll get into how
we're<00:04:29.340> gonna<00:04:29.430> stand<00:04:29.789> it<00:04:29.940> off<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.889> shell<00:04:31.889> of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
we're gonna stand it off the shell of

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.700 
we're gonna stand it off the shell of
the<00:04:32.159> heat<00:04:32.280> exchanger<00:04:32.760> so<00:04:33.000> some<00:04:33.780> ashes<00:04:34.139> can<00:04:34.530> be

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
the heat exchanger so some ashes can be

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.000 
the heat exchanger so some ashes can be
put<00:04:34.919> around<00:04:35.039> it<00:04:35.310> for<00:04:35.550> an<00:04:35.669> installation<00:04:37.010> now

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
put around it for an installation now

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.830 
put around it for an installation now
for<00:04:38.220> putting<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.639> together<00:04:38.789> what<00:04:39.630> I'm<00:04:39.720> gonna

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
for putting this together what I'm gonna

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.540 
for putting this together what I'm gonna
do<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.169> I'm<00:04:40.259> going<00:04:40.349> to<00:04:40.409> take<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.710> cedar<00:04:46.460> if<00:04:47.460> you

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
do is I'm going to take the cedar if you

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.249 
do is I'm going to take the cedar if you
give<00:04:47.669> too<00:04:47.849> much<00:04:48.030> it's<00:04:48.270> gonna<00:04:48.389> get<00:04:48.599> messy<00:04:49.020> but

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
give too much it's gonna get messy but

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.680 
give too much it's gonna get messy but
you<00:04:49.289> can<00:04:49.530> always<00:04:49.680> wipe<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.159> off<00:04:50.599> after<00:04:51.599> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
you can always wipe it off after the

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.210 
you can always wipe it off after the
fact<00:04:51.900> main<00:04:52.169> idea<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.560> we<00:04:52.680> want<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.070> be

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
fact main idea is we want it to be

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.879 
fact main idea is we want it to be
sealed<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:53.669> between<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.150> cracks<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:55.800> know

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
sealed in between the cracks you know

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.770 
sealed in between the cracks you know
prevent<00:04:56.310> smoke<00:04:56.639> from<00:04:56.820> being<00:04:57.060> able<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.300> from

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
prevent smoke from being able to from

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.100 
prevent smoke from being able to from
getting<00:04:58.110> out<00:04:58.259> of<00:04:58.289> line<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.470> it'll<00:05:01.889> also

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
getting out of line and it'll also

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.740 
getting out of line and it'll also
prevent<00:05:04.110> heat<00:05:04.440> from<00:05:04.800> escaping<00:05:05.449> from<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.599> heat

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
prevent heat from escaping from the heat

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.210 
prevent heat from escaping from the heat
exchanger<00:05:07.229> where<00:05:07.380> we<00:05:07.530> really<00:05:07.800> don't<00:05:07.949> want<00:05:08.130> it

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
exchanger where we really don't want it

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:16.969 
exchanger where we really don't want it
to<00:05:08.280> go

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.070 

okay<00:05:20.310> then<00:05:21.310> line<00:05:21.880> it<00:05:21.910> up<00:05:22.120> so<00:05:22.300> it's<00:05:22.449> at<00:05:22.960> the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
okay then line it up so it's at the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:38.700 
okay then line it up so it's at the
front<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:37.120> sure<00:05:37.389> this<00:05:37.569> lined<00:05:37.900> up<00:05:38.139> on<00:05:38.680> the

front and sure this lined up on the
inside<00:05:39.389> flash<00:05:40.389> with<00:05:40.599> one<00:05:40.810> side<00:05:52.259> then<00:05:53.259> rip<00:05:54.070> it

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
inside flash with one side then rip it

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:01.770 
inside flash with one side then rip it
away<00:05:59.699> one<00:06:00.699> of<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:00.849> big<00:06:01.030> mistakes<00:06:01.449> that<00:06:01.570> people

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
away one of the big mistakes that people

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.430 
away one of the big mistakes that people
do<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.440> lot<00:06:02.650> of<00:06:02.949> times<00:06:03.220> is<00:06:03.880> they<00:06:04.180> drive<00:06:04.630> drive

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
do a lot of times is they drive drive

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.649 
do a lot of times is they drive drive
the<00:06:05.620> drill<00:06:05.860> extremely<00:06:06.580> fast<00:06:06.880> what<00:06:07.270> that<00:06:07.449> does

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
the drill extremely fast what that does

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.749 
the drill extremely fast what that does
on<00:06:08.020> metal<00:06:08.440> is<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.860> just<00:06:09.009> burns<00:06:09.220> up<00:06:09.400> your<00:06:09.550> drill

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
on metal is it just burns up your drill

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.120 
on metal is it just burns up your drill
bit<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.900> won't<00:06:11.050> get<00:06:11.199> near<00:06:11.409> as<00:06:11.530> many<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:11.949> when

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
bit you won't get near as many and when

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.170 
bit you won't get near as many and when
you're<00:06:12.250> dealing<00:06:12.340> with<00:06:12.460> stainless<00:06:12.970> steel

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
you're dealing with stainless steel

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.589 
you're dealing with stainless steel
where<00:06:13.419> it's<00:06:13.539> a<00:06:13.659> very<00:06:13.990> hard<00:06:14.919> steel<00:06:15.520> you<00:06:16.389> don't

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
where it's a very hard steel you don't

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:17.969 
where it's a very hard steel you don't
want<00:06:16.840> to<00:06:16.930> be<00:06:17.020> driving<00:06:17.229> your<00:06:17.500> drill<00:06:17.740> really

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
want to be driving your drill really

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:31.409 
want to be driving your drill really
fast<00:06:28.979> from<00:06:29.979> here<00:06:30.280> I'm<00:06:30.729> just<00:06:30.969> gonna<00:06:31.150> go<00:06:31.330> ahead

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
fast from here I'm just gonna go ahead

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.080 
fast from here I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:06:31.509> shut<00:06:31.719> the<00:06:31.840> camera<00:06:32.199> off<00:06:32.259> and<00:06:32.789> pick<00:06:33.789> back<00:06:34.030> up

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
and shut the camera off and pick back up

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
and shut the camera off and pick back up
after<00:06:34.479> this<00:06:34.750> is<00:06:34.870> riveted<00:06:36.810> once<00:06:37.810> we're<00:06:37.990> done

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
after this is riveted once we're done

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.640 
after this is riveted once we're done
with<00:06:38.320> this<00:06:39.630> you'll<00:06:40.630> notice<00:06:40.780> they<00:06:41.050> could<00:06:41.469> get

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
with this you'll notice they could get

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.189 
with this you'll notice they could get
this<00:06:41.830> on<00:06:42.009> the<00:06:42.130> bottom<00:06:42.280> and<00:06:42.729> I'm<00:06:43.360> gonna<00:06:43.509> put<00:06:44.169> a

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
this on the bottom and I'm gonna put a

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.170 
this on the bottom and I'm gonna put a
final<00:06:44.469> sealer<00:06:45.009> on<00:06:45.250> this<00:06:45.490> after<00:06:45.849> everything<00:06:46.000> is

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
final sealer on this after everything is

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.529 
final sealer on this after everything is
put<00:06:46.330> together<00:06:46.419> before<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:47.199> goes<00:06:47.320> in<00:06:47.440> the<00:06:47.530> shell

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
put together before it goes in the shell

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.050 
put together before it goes in the shell
so<00:06:49.539> the<00:06:49.630> next<00:06:49.840> step<00:06:50.080> is<00:06:50.289> to<00:06:50.440> put<00:06:50.590> in<00:06:51.060> another

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
so the next step is to put in another

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.490 
so the next step is to put in another
two<00:06:52.509> and<00:06:52.659> once<00:06:52.780> again<00:06:52.900> just<00:06:53.800> coat<00:06:54.039> them<00:06:55.289> pop<00:06:56.289> it

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
two and once again just coat them pop it

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.219 
two and once again just coat them pop it
it<00:06:56.620> down<00:06:56.830> do<00:06:57.580> make<00:06:57.789> sure<00:06:57.820> this<00:06:58.449> is<00:06:58.690> squared<00:06:59.020> up

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
it down do make sure this is squared up

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:04.980 
it down do make sure this is squared up
if<00:06:59.469> it's<00:06:59.620> not<00:06:59.680> square<00:07:03.150> pull<00:07:04.150> the<00:07:04.270> sides<00:07:04.750> into

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
if it's not square pull the sides into

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.870 
if it's not square pull the sides into
square<00:07:05.349> it's<00:07:05.830> not<00:07:06.009> square<00:07:06.280> it's<00:07:06.550> gonna<00:07:06.699> give

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
square it's not square it's gonna give

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.610 
square it's not square it's gonna give
you<00:07:06.969> business<00:07:08.759> so<00:07:09.759> do<00:07:09.909> that<00:07:13.229> okay<00:07:14.229> I<00:07:14.259> finished

you business so do that okay I finished

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.310 
you business so do that okay I finished
this<00:07:14.889> up<00:07:15.130> and<00:07:15.490> I've<00:07:16.030> actually<00:07:16.180> had<00:07:16.659> time<00:07:17.050> to<00:07:17.199> go

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
this up and I've actually had time to go

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.930 
this up and I've actually had time to go
ahead<00:07:17.560> and<00:07:17.680> seal

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
ahead and seal

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.990

my<00:07:19.780> scene<00:07:20.080> here<00:07:20.110> this<00:07:20.620> was<00:07:21.310> the<00:07:21.460> one<00:07:21.610> each<00:07:21.730> lap

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
my scene here this was the one each lap

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.820 
my scene here this was the one each lap
and<00:07:22.180> I<00:07:22.240> went<00:07:22.420> it<00:07:22.510> I<00:07:22.720> just<00:07:23.110> did<00:07:23.260> the<00:07:23.350> lap<00:07:23.530> on<00:07:23.710> the

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
and I went it I just did the lap on the

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.010 
and I went it I just did the lap on the
outside<00:07:24.190> I<00:07:24.220> sealed<00:07:24.670> it<00:07:24.820> out<00:07:24.970> with<00:07:25.750> this

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
outside I sealed it out with this

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.260 
outside I sealed it out with this
sealant<00:07:27.810> I've<00:07:28.810> sealed<00:07:29.140> it<00:07:29.320> up<00:07:29.440> a<00:07:30.030> space<00:07:31.030> have

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
sealant I've sealed it up a space have

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.120 
sealant I've sealed it up a space have
populated<00:07:31.690> zips<00:07:32.020> and<00:07:32.470> of<00:07:32.530> course<00:07:32.770> along<00:07:32.890> the

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
populated zips and of course along the

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.740 
populated zips and of course along the
bottom<00:07:33.280> also<00:07:33.790> so<00:07:34.000> now<00:07:34.030> I<00:07:34.150> have<00:07:34.390> this<00:07:34.510> stainless

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:34.750 
bottom also so now I have this stainless

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.690 
bottom also so now I have this stainless
steel<00:07:35.110> heat<00:07:35.320> exchanger<00:07:35.830> one<00:07:36.370> of<00:07:36.460> the<00:07:36.520> things

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:36.700 
steel heat exchanger one of the things

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.250 
steel heat exchanger one of the things
to<00:07:36.850> watch<00:07:37.000> out<00:07:37.270> for<00:07:37.300> when<00:07:37.600> put<00:07:37.810> this<00:07:37.930> together

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260 
to watch out for when put this together

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.410 
to watch out for when put this together
is<00:07:38.530> that<00:07:38.740> this<00:07:38.980> will<00:07:39.160> have<00:07:39.340> a<00:07:39.370> tendency<00:07:39.700> to<00:07:39.880> get

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420 
is that this will have a tendency to get

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.550 
is that this will have a tendency to get
to<00:07:40.750> office<00:07:41.080> where<00:07:41.470> it's<00:07:41.560> not<00:07:41.710> square<00:07:42.070> and<00:07:43.560> so

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
to office where it's not square and so

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.810 
to office where it's not square and so
when<00:07:44.740> you<00:07:44.800> put<00:07:44.830> it<00:07:45.040> together<00:07:45.160> and<00:07:45.460> make<00:07:45.580> sure

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:45.820 
when you put it together and make sure

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.160 
when you put it together and make sure
everything's<00:07:46.180> lining<00:07:46.420> up<00:07:46.690> make<00:07:47.140> sure

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.170 
everything's lining up make sure

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.800 
everything's lining up make sure
everything<00:07:47.590> you<00:07:47.650> square<00:07:47.980> it<00:07:48.070> up<00:07:48.220> or<00:07:49.090> else<00:07:49.540> like

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:49.810 
everything you square it up or else like

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.340 
everything you square it up or else like
I<00:07:49.840> said<00:07:50.110> you<00:07:50.230> can<00:07:50.350> have<00:07:50.380> trouble<00:07:50.710> later<00:07:51.100> on
