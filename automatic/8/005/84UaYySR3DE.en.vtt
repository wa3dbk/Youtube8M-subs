here we still have some investors there
is<00:00:12.660> enough<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.620> fungal<00:00:14.370> growth<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.820> it

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
is enough for one fungal growth is it

ground<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.110> there's<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.439> much<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.009> army

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
ground that there's not much of an army
so<00:01:17.729> SDC<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.330> probably<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.689> walk<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.229> here

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so SDC can probably just walk up here

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.590 
so SDC can probably just walk up here
and<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.460> units<00:01:20.790> these<00:01:20.939> museums

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

much energy as possible it needs another
seven<00:01:27.930> energy<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.500> needs<00:01:28.770> another<00:01:29.009> 25

the Zerg player decided to create
roaches<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.870> counter<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> Hellions<00:02:31.860> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
coming perhaps thinking that there was

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.590 
coming perhaps thinking that there was
going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.070> be<00:02:35.100> maybe<00:02:35.760> even<00:02:36.030> some<00:02:36.330> sort<00:02:36.510> of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
going to be maybe even some sort of

going to be maybe even some sort of
dropped<00:02:36.900> later<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.740> instead<00:02:38.130> by<00:02:38.310> coming<00:02:38.760> into

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
dropped later but instead by coming into

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.490 
dropped later but instead by coming into
banshees<00:02:39.390> these<00:02:39.570> two<00:02:39.780> banshees<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.380> were

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
banshees these two banshees that were

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.040 
banshees these two banshees that were
here<00:02:41.459> throughout<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.120> game<00:02:42.330> yeah<00:02:42.570> down<00:02:42.810> over

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
here throughout the game yeah down over

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.250 
here throughout the game yeah down over
here<00:02:43.290> able<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.069> 19<00:02:44.489> kills<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.150> 28<00:02:45.989> kills

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
here able to get 19 kills and 28 kills

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.140 
here able to get 19 kills and 28 kills
so<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> definitely<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.120> a

so that is a definitely that is a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.600 
so that is a definitely that is a
definite<00:02:48.510> large<00:02:48.840> number<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.170> kills<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:50.280> those

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
definite large number of kills on those

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.310 
definite large number of kills on those
two<00:02:50.850> banshees<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.450> most<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.170> those<00:02:52.260> were

two banshees and most of those were

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.040 
two banshees and most of those were
either<00:02:52.739> perhaps<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.880> or<00:02:53.910> two<00:02:54.269> queens<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.019> a
