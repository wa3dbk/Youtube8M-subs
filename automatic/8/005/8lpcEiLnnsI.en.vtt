00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
well if he wins a place but he does and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.479

he could go all the way we just we were

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.860 
he could go all the way we just we were
unlucky<00:03:00.790> enough<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> get<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> world<00:03:01.420> title<00:03:01.569> shot
