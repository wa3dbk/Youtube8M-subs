00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that player now the first of the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.959 
that player now the first of the
centre-backs<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> man<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> plays<00:00:47.820> at

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
centre-backs is a man that plays at

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.229 
centre-backs is a man that plays at
Everton<00:00:48.360> he<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.960> Alcaraz<00:00:49.680> his<00:00:50.070> paces<00:00:50.460> only<00:00:50.550> 53

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
Everton he is Alcaraz his paces only 53

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.869 
Everton he is Alcaraz his paces only 53
but<00:00:51.570> he's<00:00:51.750> got<00:00:51.899> 74<00:00:52.469> defending<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.129> 75<00:00:53.640> hidin
