00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
that the fly tumbler out naturally keeps

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.270 
that the fly tumbler out naturally keeps

the<00:00:44.820> advantage<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> do

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the advantage here is that if you do

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
the advantage here is that if you do
break<00:00:46.199> off<00:00:46.410> its<00:00:46.589> gonna<00:00:46.710> break<00:00:46.949> off<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
break off its gonna break off from the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
break off its gonna break off from the

flies<00:01:55.770> around<00:01:56.009> I've<00:01:56.219> got<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.460> egg<00:01:56.609> fly<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
flies around I've got an egg fly and a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.499 
flies around I've got an egg fly and a
stonefly<00:01:57.930> nymph<00:01:58.170> down<00:01:58.619> below<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.149> then<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
stonefly nymph down below and then the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.240 
stonefly nymph down below and then the
double<00:02:00.659> surgeon's<00:02:01.140> knot<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.950> heavier

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
double surgeon's knot from the heavier

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.050 
double surgeon's knot from the heavier
fluoro<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.539> lighter<00:02:03.750> fluorocarbon<00:02:04.649> tip

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
fluoro to the lighter fluorocarbon tip

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.849 
fluoro to the lighter fluorocarbon tip
keeps<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> split<00:02:06.450> shot<00:02:06.630> from<00:02:06.899> slipping<00:02:07.710> too

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
keeps the split shot from slipping too

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.020 
keeps the split shot from slipping too
close<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> fly<00:02:08.490> so<00:02:08.670> you've<00:02:08.820> always<00:02:08.940> got

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
close to the fly so you've always got

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.590 
close to the fly so you've always got
about<00:02:09.300> 12<00:02:09.600> 12<00:02:10.470> inches<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:11.270> distance<00:02:12.270> from<00:02:12.420> your

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
about 12 12 inches of distance from your

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.130 
about 12 12 inches of distance from your
your<00:02:12.900> split<00:02:13.140> shot<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.470> your<00:02:13.560> first<00:02:13.770> fly<00:02:15.140> using

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
your split shot to your first fly using

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.270 
your split shot to your first fly using
these<00:02:16.410> rigs<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> little<00:02:17.070> bit<00:02:17.160> awkward

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
these rigs is a little bit awkward

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.850 
these rigs is a little bit awkward
you're<00:02:17.610> deaf

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you're deaf

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.220 
you're deaf
never<00:02:18.160> gonna<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:18.970> doing<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.690> lot<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.960> false

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
never gonna be doing a lot of false

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.380 
never gonna be doing a lot of false
casting<00:02:20.680> back<00:02:20.920> casting<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:25.060> better<00:02:25.240> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
casting back casting it's it's better to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.030 
casting back casting it's it's better to
use<00:02:25.450> either<00:02:25.660> distinct<00:02:26.020> singles<00:02:26.410> fake<00:02:26.590> ass<00:02:26.830> or

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
use either distinct singles fake ass or

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.380 
use either distinct singles fake ass or
roll<00:02:27.220> cast<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:27.670> basically<00:02:27.910> you're<00:02:28.090> gonna<00:02:28.180> be

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
roll cast so basically you're gonna be

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
roll cast so basically you're gonna be
you<00:02:28.900> know<00:02:29.020> high<00:02:29.200> stick<00:02:29.470> sort<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.890> drifting

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you know high stick sort of drifting

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.770 
you know high stick sort of drifting
down<00:02:30.370> past<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.850> you're<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.390> going<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.660> want

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
down past you you're just going to want

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.090 
down past you you're just going to want
to<00:02:31.870> lift<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.140> up<00:02:32.170> off<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.380> water<00:02:32.650> nicely

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
to lift it up off the water nicely

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.910 
to lift it up off the water nicely
flip<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.700> back<00:02:33.730> upstream<00:02:34.330> or<00:02:34.620> flip<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.710> above

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
flip it back upstream or flip it above

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.670 
flip it back upstream or flip it above
you<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.340> do<00:02:36.520> sort<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.850> single<00:02:37.300> Spade<00:02:37.680> stay

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
you and do sort of a single Spade stay

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.460 
you and do sort of a single Spade stay
cast<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.520> get<00:02:39.670> these<00:02:39.850> these<00:02:40.540> indicators<00:02:41.290> and

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
cast to get these these indicators and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.720 
cast to get these these indicators and
fly<00:02:41.650> rigs<00:02:41.860> out<00:02:41.980> there<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.220> little<00:02:42.310> bit<00:02:42.460> clumsy

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
fly rigs out there a little bit clumsy

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.960 
fly rigs out there a little bit clumsy
so<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.060> want<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.270> be<00:02:44.280> nice<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.520> steady<00:02:45.700> when
