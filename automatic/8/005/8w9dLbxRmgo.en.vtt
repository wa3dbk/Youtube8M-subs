00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.549
 hi guys welcome to another class 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.690
 biology and the subject of this class is the 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.670
 photojournalism what happens as 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.279
 that plants know the time 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.109
 right for them to bloom 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 I imagine you should already have 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.750
 perceived that some species of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 plants only bloom in the summer, another only 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.680
 flowers in winter, right? 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.969
 how does it happen how does the plant 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.219
 Do you know that it's winter and summer? 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.590
 I do not have access to the newspaper she does not see 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.719
 facebook how will she know which 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.120
 It's the season of the year if yesterday for this. 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.420
 the fact is, she can 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.399
 to know what season of the year she is in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 function of a protein called a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.870
 chrome we'll see in the next video 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 Now that time is need you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 understand more or less how 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.299
 Does this job work for journalism photos? 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.720
 what is this 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.470
 a photo period is the period of light nec 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.509
 that exists on a certain day a plant 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.450
 that we call the short day plant 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.060
 It is a flowering plant when photo 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.549
 period or period of light 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 it is small relative to the period of 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.659
 night 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 It happens, it's not summer in the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.409
 Summer we have long days. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.759
 That's why we have to take advantage of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.229
 better the light of day 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.229
 so what happens 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.590
 they are usually 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:56.610
 in the winter season when the flowers 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:02.270
 come up on a short day and at night 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.040
 mainly guard this is long 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.729
 So when we have this kind of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.100
 photo period occurs the flowering of the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.400
 plant flowers 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:22.070
 Now if for some reason if for some 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.040
 reason her night time is 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.590
 interrupted with light such a dark period 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:37.980
 her was interrupted by light 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:40.980
 this plant does not bloom the reason for it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.040
 can be explained by the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.210
 of phytoplankton is this protein that 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.330
 it needs a certain period of light 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.510
 dark of a long night to signal 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.060
 to the plant she is in winter 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.680
 if that dark period he is 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.320
 interrupted 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.210
 the plant can not perceive that the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.140
 winter has arrived and therefore it 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.930
 then favors short-day plants 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.780
 bloom in winter bloom when the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.450
 night is long and not interrupted by 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.810
 some light source 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.070
 the opposite happens for a plant 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:27.750
 long day 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:33.000
 the opposite is long 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.820
 It will bloom in the summer right then 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.650
 that we have in the summer we have long days and 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.600
 Short nights right so yes I have 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.360
 photo the period so the day enjoying 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:50.220
 Longest night that plant here she 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:55.709
 will not favor flourishes 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:59.580
 only if I do and interrupt this 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.459
 long night time with light 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.310
 sure the day was short but the night was 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.400
 interrupted with right light 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.810
 this plant she can bloom 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.730
 flowers 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.950
 then what are the conditions for a 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.799
 dialogue plant to bloom 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.799
 first she needs a long day, right? 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:30.240
 She needs a short , long night. 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.419
 it does not bloom and then it blooms in 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.580
 long days and short nights or in 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.800
 periods of darkness that were 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.830
 interrupted for a period of 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.540
 sure sure people next video let's go 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:49.220
 inter and understand why this happens 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.220
 a kiss and until
