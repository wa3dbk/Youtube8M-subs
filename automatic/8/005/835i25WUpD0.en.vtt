00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.810
 I'll make you like the food 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 The week before this time is about this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.290
 red vegetables like paprika 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.880
 I could have shone that's why she was like that 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 healthy is what the difference between 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 red yellow and green paprika is and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.270
 why the paprika is so interesting for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 all athletes resp 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 The people who want to lose weight therefore 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.369
 all that and much more is there after that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.369
 stay tuned 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.970
 Let's start with the ingredients 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.280
 a 100 gram paprika she 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.750
 own around 35 calories that's not 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.699
 very much and accordingly suitable 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.110
 The peppers are very good as well 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.089
 food during a diet 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.640
 she owns around five grams 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.559
 carbohydrates a gram of proteins and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.870
 zero grams of fat are also fiber 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.479
 in the paprika contain a very high 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.540
 worth has the paprika on the vitamin c 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.640
 with 140 milligrams per 100 grams 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.399
 That's a hugely valuable one key 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.869
 own around 70 milligrams to 100 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.390
 gram, therefore, is the paprika 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.780
 the red paprika really a vitamin c 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.330
 bomb why is the vitamin c the red 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.130
 paprika is so interesting to us now 140 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.960
 Milligram is of course a high number 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.700
 and vitamin c naturally has several 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.680
 characteristics on our body me 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.750
 strength the immune system binds free 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.729
 Radicals in our body but not 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.659
 Only the vitamin C can also help us 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.130
 help lose weight 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.049
 because vitamin c is an important one 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.299
 ingredient for production more important 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.350
 Hormones are the fat burning 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.360
 boost 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.560
 Say these hormones if we have the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 so to speak, if our body 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.090
 produces these solve the cases solve 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.950
 the fat out of the fat cells ours 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.930
 Body can fat that much faster 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.250
 then use it for energy 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.810
 That's why we should be on the body 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950
 always enough with vitamin c 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.720
 supply if we lose weight 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.430
 and of course we do 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.740
 want to strengthen our immune system and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.479
 generally keep our body healthy 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.680
 would like 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.110
 other important ingredients in the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.850
 Red peppers are magnesium calcium 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.920
 potassium in very very high quantities and the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.049
 vitamins A and B and they are very 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.900
 important for a healthy body and 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.280
 very very important all the people 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.990
 want to operate muscle and / or 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.970
 but not only those want to keep fit 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.769
 Materials are also interesting secondary 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.689
 plant substances because these are too 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.489
 numerous contained in the red paprika 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.069
 and these have a positive impact 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.010
 to be mentioned on our metabolism 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.049
 for solid and canteen and have this 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.450
 an antioxidant effect 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.730
 they tie in for example radical in 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.739
 but also protect his body 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.640
 our cardiovascular system 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.080
 Pre-existing diseases, therefore, are these 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.360
 secondary plant substances very much 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.830
 important another one more 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.779
 property of this is, for example, too 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.860
 that you have our digestive system positive 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.960
 influence 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.180
 Our stomach produces more gastric juice 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.100
 the digestive tract is not like that 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.260
 cramped and it will be yes 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.120
 Digestive problems inhibited by all 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.070
 people have problems on a toilet 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.350
 should often resort to publicis 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.240
 the red paprika is really 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.340
 something special i can only answer you 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.650
 heart often times to eat no matter 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 whether as an ingredient in a salad as a side dish 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.150
 at a court or as 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 simple snack while watching television 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.370
 really just super protects 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.350
 Our body helps us 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.270
 muscle building or while losing weight 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.760
 Accordingly, this is really a top 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.350
 vegetables why are the peppers now ? 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.910
 in different colors 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.380
 That depends on the degree of maturity 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.050
 A red paprika is a soft one 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.830
 paprika and has the most 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.330
 ingredients or the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.160
 highest value in ingredients like me 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.690
 called you guys here in the video one 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.730
 Green paprika is actually one 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.020
 immature paprika but this one can 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 of course eating that is not 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.930
 problem that only has less 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.209
 Ingredients and the yellow paprika 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.340
 is actually in between so so with the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.230
 ingredients and accordingly 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.790
 you eat all three colors that it is not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.980
 problem there are also orange peppers 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.420
 Paprika should be able to eat any 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.500
