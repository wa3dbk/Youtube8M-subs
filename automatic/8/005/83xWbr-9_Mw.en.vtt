 how 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.730

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.700
 the round shape in 1906 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.700
 a 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.810
 farmer 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 Oh 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.590

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.040

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.760

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.919
 spent 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.050
 side has also become really nice but that 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.070
 sounds that way too 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.070
 tasty I think
