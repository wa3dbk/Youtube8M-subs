00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.290 
way for him he's muscle snatching this
we<00:03:30.530> basically<00:03:30.710> barely<00:03:31.580> needs<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.970> bend<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
we basically barely needs to bend the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.480 
we basically barely needs to bend the
knees<00:03:32.510> couple<00:03:33.410> reps<00:03:33.650> lap<00:03:33.920> they're<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.370> going

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
knees couple reps lap they're just going

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.240 
knees couple reps lap they're just going
to<00:03:34.550> walk<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.940> across<00:03:35.240> and<00:03:35.600> then<00:03:36.290> DC<00:03:36.740> just<00:03:37.010> needs

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
to walk it across and then DC just needs

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.270 
to walk it across and then DC just needs
to<00:03:37.460> finished<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:39.050> two<00:03:39.110> more<00:03:39.560> points<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.070> Los

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
to finished so two more points to Los

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.960 
to finished so two more points to Los
Angeles<00:03:40.910> they've<00:03:41.150> won<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> last<00:03:41.870> two<00:03:42.260> races

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
Angeles they've won the last two races

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.540 
Angeles they've won the last two races
and<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.960> DC<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.680> time<00:03:45.890> for<00:03:46.100> them<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.220> figure

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
and for DC it's time for them to figure

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.100 
and for DC it's time for them to figure
out<00:03:46.640> how<00:03:46.790> how<00:03:47.360> they're<00:03:47.570> going<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.750> make<00:03:47.900> this

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
out how how they're going to make this

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.570 
out how how they're going to make this
go<00:03:48.320> little<00:03:48.620> faster<00:03:48.950> because<00:03:49.190> remember<00:03:49.370> we

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
go little faster because remember we

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.130 
go little faster because remember we
turn<00:03:49.850> right<00:03:50.000> around<00:03:50.330> clean<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:50.690> they<00:03:50.900> do<00:03:50.959> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
turn right around clean and they do the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.870 
turn right around clean and they do the
exact<00:03:51.440> same<00:03:51.470> race<00:03:51.920> over<00:03:52.220> again<00:03:52.370> cool<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:52.790> if

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
exact same race over again cool so if

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.449 
exact same race over again cool so if
your<00:03:53.000> head<00:03:53.209> coach<00:03:53.510> just<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:53.989> front<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.380> DC<00:03:54.950> do

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
your head coach just in front of DC do

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.190 
your head coach just in front of DC do
you<00:03:55.550> make<00:03:55.730> some<00:03:55.940> substitutions<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.810> who<00:03:57.020> goes

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
you make some substitutions on who goes

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.640 
you make some substitutions on who goes
where<00:03:57.910> Justin<00:03:58.910> collar<00:03:59.180> tends<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.959> not<00:04:00.110> do<00:04:00.470> that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
where Justin collar tends to not do that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.160 
where Justin collar tends to not do that
he<00:04:00.860> likes<00:04:01.220> his<00:04:01.430> strategy<00:04:02.060> likes<00:04:02.630> his<00:04:02.810> athletes

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
he likes his strategy likes his athletes

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.010 
he likes his strategy likes his athletes
where<00:04:03.530> he<00:04:03.709> places<00:04:03.980> them<00:04:04.280> all<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.390> times<00:04:05.660> will

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
where he places them all the times will

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.490 
where he places them all the times will
not<00:04:06.230> make<00:04:06.500> an<00:04:06.650> adjustment<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:07.190> that

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.199 

seriously<00:04:10.500> for<00:04:10.980> example<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.819> tailor<00:04:12.180> is

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
seriously for example if the tailor is

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.940 
seriously for example if the tailor is
injured<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.019> just<00:04:13.349> get<00:04:13.530> through<00:04:13.709> some<00:04:13.890> of

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
injured and just get through some of

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.589 
injured and just get through some of
those<00:04:14.010> movements<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:15.390> we're<00:04:15.510> going

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
those movements but I think we're going

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.860 
those movements but I think we're going
to<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> strategy<00:04:16.620> for<00:04:17.400> DC<00:04:17.970> continue<00:04:18.660> as

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
to see the strategy for DC continue as

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.229 
to see the strategy for DC continue as
it<00:04:19.169> has<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.650> at<00:04:19.799> race<00:04:20.280> number<00:04:20.519> five<00:04:20.700> had<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> few

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
it has it at race number five had a few

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.290 
it has it at race number five had a few
moments<00:04:21.630> ago<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.200> was<00:04:22.410> six<00:04:22.770> three<00:04:23.310> DC<00:04:23.970> they<00:04:24.120> had

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
moments ago it was six three DC they had

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.620 
moments ago it was six three DC they had
all<00:04:24.540> momentum<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.380> now<00:04:25.590> eight<00:04:25.950> seven<00:04:26.820> as<00:04:26.940> we

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
all momentum it is now eight seven as we

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.690 
all momentum it is now eight seven as we
get<00:04:27.870> set<00:04:28.229> for<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.710> next<00:04:28.830> race<00:04:29.160> which<00:04:29.370> will<00:04:29.550> be

get set for the next race which will be

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.560 
get set for the next race which will be
echo<00:04:30.090> race<00:04:30.479> number<00:04:30.930> six<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:32.090> dusty<00:04:33.090> Highland

echo race number six and dusty Highland

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.220 
echo race number six and dusty Highland
very<00:04:33.930> very<00:04:34.200> happy<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.830> I'm<00:04:35.130> sure
