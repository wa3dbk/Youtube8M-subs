cars but there's still a car so we'll go

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.220 
cars but there's still a car so we'll go
over<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.950> hardly<00:00:14.700> works<00:00:14.910> almost<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:16.109> your

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
over how hardly works almost all your

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.349 
over how hardly works almost all your
Model<00:00:16.470> T's<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.520> fuel

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
Model T's are going to have the fuel

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
Model T's are going to have the fuel
shutoff<00:00:18.600> valve<00:00:18.900> under<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> hood<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.279> one's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
shutoff valve under the hood this one's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.070 
shutoff valve under the hood this one's
really<00:00:20.699> nicely<00:00:21.000> labeled<00:00:21.420> here

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
really nicely labeled here

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.290 
really nicely labeled here
that's<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.920> speedster<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> trucks<00:00:24.090> like

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
that's a speedster and the trucks like

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.429 
that's a speedster and the trucks like
that<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.480> think<00:00:24.630> maybe<00:00:24.779> somewhere<00:00:25.109> else<00:00:25.170> you

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that I think maybe somewhere else you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.870 
that I think maybe somewhere else you
might<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> locate<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.310> but

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
might have to locate it first but

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.830 
might have to locate it first but
normally<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.210> gonna<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.510> gonna<00:00:27.630> find

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
normally it's gonna be here gonna find

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540 
normally it's gonna be here gonna find
the<00:00:27.900> sediment<00:00:28.260> ball<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.740> then<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:29.310> gonna

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the sediment ball and then there's gonna

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.710 
the sediment ball and then there's gonna
file<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.300> we're<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> turn

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
file right there we're going to turn

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.070 
file right there we're going to turn
that<00:00:30.810> down

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that down

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
that down
it's<00:00:31.529> gonna<00:00:31.679> turn<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> gas<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's gonna turn the gas on it's a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610 
it's gonna turn the gas on it's a
gravity-fed<00:00:33.420> system<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.110> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.320> leave<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
gravity-fed system so if you leave the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
gravity-fed system so if you leave the
gas<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.309> car's<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.640> running<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.149> parts<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
gas on the car's not running or parts it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.170 
gas on the car's not running or parts it
will<00:00:37.200> leak<00:00:37.410> out<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> carburetor<00:00:44.059> point<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
will leak out the carburetor point out a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.220 
will leak out the carburetor point out a
couple<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.480> things<00:00:45.780> inside<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.590> car<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
couple of things inside the car the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
couple of things inside the car the
ignition<00:00:49.620> key<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.760> simpler

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
ignition key which is there very simpler

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.060 
ignition key which is there very simpler
is<00:00:51.149> only<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.449> five<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.870> six<00:00:51.899> designs<00:00:52.379> goes

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is only like five or six designs goes

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.810 
is only like five or six designs goes
right<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> center<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> switch

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.850 

okay<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.990> that's<00:00:58.110> which<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.470> actually<00:00:58.740> your

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
okay now that's which is actually your

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.150 
okay now that's which is actually your
headlights<00:00:59.310> your<00:00:59.670> ignition<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.780> turned<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.470> or

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
headlights your ignition is turned on or

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.360 
headlights your ignition is turned on or
off<00:01:02.220> by<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.700> key<00:01:03.920> while<00:01:04.920> we're<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.190> going<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
off by the key while we're I'm going to

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.710 
off by the key while we're I'm going to
step<00:01:05.610> keep<00:01:05.940> out<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> car<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.630> I'll

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
step keep out of the car here and I'll

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.210 
step keep out of the car here and I'll
show<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.110> learn<00:01:07.230> things<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.980> go<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
show you some learn things if we go in

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.100 
show you some learn things if we go in
on<00:01:08.340> these<00:01:08.490> pedals<00:01:08.970> where<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> lot<00:01:09.870> of<00:01:09.930> people

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
on these pedals where a lot of people

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530 
on these pedals where a lot of people
think<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.650> great<00:01:11.370> clutch<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.970> gas

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
think that's a great clutch of gas

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.860 
think that's a great clutch of gas
and<00:01:13.440> actually<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.730> none<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.660> is

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
and actually it's none of those this is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.830 
and actually it's none of those this is
your<00:01:16.410> forward<00:01:16.740> gear<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.820> reverse<00:01:18.210> gear<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
your forward gear your reverse gear and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
your forward gear your reverse gear and
your<00:01:19.350> brake<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.270> trips<00:01:21.660> are

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
your brake so that's what trips are

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.860 
your brake so that's what trips are
going<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.110> again<00:01:22.820> forward<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> your

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
going up again forward this is your

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.920 
going up again forward this is your
reverse<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.040> brake<00:01:26.720> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> come

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
reverse this is your brake if you come

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170 
reverse this is your brake if you come
up<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> steering<00:01:28.530> column<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.060> have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
up to the steering column here we have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.710 
up to the steering column here we have
the<00:01:30.300> steering<00:01:30.509> wheel<00:01:31.910> on<00:01:32.910> your<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.450> side

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the steering wheel on your right side

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.460 
the steering wheel on your right side
you<00:01:34.050> have<00:01:34.680> throttle<00:01:35.670> control<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.119> gas<00:01:36.380> now<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you have throttle control or gas now the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.040 
you have throttle control or gas now the
left<00:01:37.680> side<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.270> timing<00:01:39.270> advance<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.840> or

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
left side you have timing advance and or

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.830 
left side you have timing advance and or
retard<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> goes<00:01:42.150> off<00:01:42.360> you're<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> retard

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
retard so as it goes off you're a retard

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
retard so as it goes off you're a retard
the<00:01:42.930> timing<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.860> bring<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.280> down<00:01:44.430> you're

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the timing is you bring it down you're

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.930 
the timing is you bring it down you're
advancing<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> timing<00:01:46.550> right<00:01:47.550> here<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
advancing the timing right here on the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.070 
advancing the timing right here on the
floor<00:01:48.210> board<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.490> looks<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
floor board is that it looks like a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.240 
floor board is that it looks like a
bright<00:01:52.080> switch<00:01:52.410> or<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.680> headlight<00:01:52.920> button<00:01:53.100> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
bright switch or a headlight button is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.030 
bright switch or a headlight button is
actually<00:01:53.550> your<00:01:53.700> starter<00:01:54.090> button<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:55.040> then

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
actually your starter button and then

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.560 
actually your starter button and then
here<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:56.790> everyone<00:01:57.090> thinks<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
here which everyone thinks is just a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
here which everyone thinks is just a
handbrake<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.380> actually<00:01:58.740> three

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
handbrake this is actually three

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.270 
handbrake this is actually three
functions<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> way<00:02:00.840> forward<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:02.100> gonna

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
functions all the way forward is gonna

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
functions all the way forward is gonna
see<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> pedal<00:02:02.880> moved<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.630> four

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
see that pedal moved a little the four

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.440 
see that pedal moved a little the four
pal<00:02:04.560> moves<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> your<00:02:05.430> high<00:02:05.640> gear<00:02:05.940> when

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
pal moves that is your high gear when

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.120 
pal moves that is your high gear when
this<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.710> way<00:02:07.800> forward

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
this when this is all the way forward

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.759 
this when this is all the way forward
the<00:02:08.850> car<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.239> by<00:02:09.600> itself<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.350> for<00:02:10.590> any

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
the car will go by itself and for any

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.680 
the car will go by itself and for any
forward<00:02:11.220> motion<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.269> have<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> make<00:02:12.660> sure

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
forward motion so you have to make sure

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.460 
forward motion so you have to make sure
you<00:02:13.019> keep<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.850> back<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.150> center<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:16.019> you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you keep that back in the center if you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
you keep that back in the center if you
use<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:16.890> normal<00:02:17.190> driving<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
use what for normal driving and then you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.990 
use what for normal driving and then you
can<00:02:18.750> use<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.989> use<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> foot<00:02:19.620> pedal<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.040> low

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
can use to use the foot pedal for low

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.330 
can use to use the foot pedal for low
gear<00:02:21.299> if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.019> pull<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.230> all<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.739> way<00:02:22.799> back<00:02:22.980> it

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
gear if you pull it all the way back it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.660 
gear if you pull it all the way back it
is<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> hand<00:02:24.090> brake<00:02:24.299> so<00:02:25.260> we'll<00:02:26.130> leave<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.430> back

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
is a hand brake so we'll leave that back

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.860 
is a hand brake so we'll leave that back
all<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.330> way

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.790 

so<00:02:34.870> again<00:02:35.020> we're<00:02:35.140> gonna<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.410> over<00:02:35.590> all<00:02:35.650> this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
so again we're gonna go over all this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.360 
so again we're gonna go over all this
take<00:02:36.010> one<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.340> time

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
take one more time

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.450 
take one more time
we<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:40.110> battery<00:02:41.110> now<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.040> can't<00:02:42.250> start

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
we have battery now so you can't start

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.560 
we have battery now so you can't start
to<00:02:42.520> make<00:02:42.670> me<00:02:42.760> too<00:02:42.850> but<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.090> much<00:02:43.360> much<00:02:43.510> easier

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
to make me too but it's much much easier

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.480 
to make me too but it's much much easier
and<00:02:43.900> battery<00:02:44.170> that's<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:44.500> we<00:02:44.620> recommend<00:02:45.040> if

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
and battery that's what we recommend if

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.680 
and battery that's what we recommend if
you<00:02:45.610> hear<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> buzz<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.030> site<00:02:46.390> buzzing

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you hear the buzz that site buzzing

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.450 
you hear the buzz that site buzzing
sound<00:02:46.900> that's<00:02:47.110> our<00:02:47.260> coils<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.740> are<00:02:47.860> now

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
sound that's our coils that are now

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.080 
sound that's our coils that are now
buzzing<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.480> again<00:02:50.010> forward<00:02:51.010> gear<00:02:51.280> reverse

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
buzzing so again forward gear reverse

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.210 
buzzing so again forward gear reverse
