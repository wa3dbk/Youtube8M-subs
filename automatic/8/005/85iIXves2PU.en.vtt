00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
the differences now between the old

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.869 
the differences now between the old
neutrino<00:02:48.879> soundboard<00:02:49.419> and<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:50.079> radiant<00:02:50.470> now

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
neutrino soundboard and the radiant now

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.369 
neutrino soundboard and the radiant now
you<00:02:51.879> may<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.120> don't<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.019> cameras<00:02:53.290> going

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
you may I don't think the cameras going

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.309 
you may I don't think the cameras going
to<00:02:53.439> pick<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.799> up<00:02:53.889> I'm<00:02:54.220> hoping<00:02:54.669> it<00:02:54.819> will<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
to pick it up I'm hoping it will but it

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.589 
to pick it up I'm hoping it will but it
is<00:02:56.530> these<00:02:57.099> are<00:02:57.280> significantly<00:02:58.000> brighter<00:02:58.299> with

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
is these are significantly brighter with

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.690 
is these are significantly brighter with
the<00:02:58.720> new<00:02:58.810> 12<00:02:59.079> watts<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.099> is<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> 12<00:03:00.549> out

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
the new 12 watts so this is a 12 out

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.729 
the new 12 watts so this is a 12 out
cyan<00:03:01.090> versus<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.049> 5<00:03:02.650> watt<00:03:02.889> green<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.720> let's<00:03:05.590> go

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
cyan versus a 5 watt green so let's go

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:15.420 
cyan versus a 5 watt green so let's go
ahead<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.010> take<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> look<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:15.040> right<00:03:15.189> let's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
ahead and take a look all right let's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.089 
ahead and take a look all right let's
turn<00:03:16.180> off<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.389> lights<00:03:16.569> here<00:03:16.889> see<00:03:17.889> if<00:03:17.919> that

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
turn off the lights here see if that

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:28.530 
turn off the lights here see if that
helps<00:03:18.780> come<00:03:19.780> on<00:03:19.900> where's<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:27.449> here<00:03:28.449> we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
helps come on where's this one here we

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.689 
helps come on where's this one here we
go<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:30.760> right<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.979> so<00:03:32.979> let's<00:03:33.340> turn<00:03:33.489> on<00:03:33.669> the

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
go all right now so let's turn on the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:40.480 
go all right now so let's turn on the
Guardian<00:03:34.449> 5<00:03:35.109> watt

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.430 

what's<00:03:40.880> great<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.450> know<00:03:41.570> awesome<00:03:41.780> i<00:03:42.110> love

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.000 
what's great you know awesome i love
this<00:03:42.650> saber<00:03:43.460> i<00:03:43.700> love<00:03:43.910> design<00:03:44.620> but<00:03:45.620> let's<00:03:45.830> turn

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
this saber i love design but let's turn

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.520 
this saber i love design but let's turn
on<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.130> 12<00:03:46.430> oh<00:03:49.900> so

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.160 

at<00:03:54.520> least<00:03:54.670> from<00:03:54.819> my<00:03:54.880> view<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.390> kind<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.720> hard<00:03:56.050> to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
at least from my view is kind of hard to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.900 
at least from my view is kind of hard to
tell<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:59.500> science<00:03:59.890> is<00:04:00.069> overpowering<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
tell but the science is overpowering the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.180 
tell but the science is overpowering the
green<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:01.920> definitely<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.950> lot<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.160> mean

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
green it's definitely a lot I mean

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.660 
green it's definitely a lot I mean
they're<00:04:03.430> both<00:04:03.610> quite<00:04:03.940> obviously<00:04:04.709> but<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:06.520> is

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
they're both quite obviously but this is

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.740 
they're both quite obviously but this is
