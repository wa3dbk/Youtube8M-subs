but I was like 1970s then bikes were
quite<00:00:31.289> expensive<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> later<00:00:32.399> model

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
notices its underbar sakes probably

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.290 
notices its underbar sakes probably
still<00:00:56.520> saying<00:00:56.760> quite<00:00:56.969> cloth<00:00:57.300> tape<00:00:58.260> itself<00:00:58.739> and

the<00:01:00.469> bracket<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> lights<00:01:02.489> missing<00:01:03.030> these

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the bracket for the lights missing these

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.109 
the bracket for the lights missing these
are<00:01:03.870> different<00:01:04.170> saddles<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.880> what<00:01:05.880> other

are different saddles and what other
features<00:01:06.360> these<00:01:06.630> completely<00:01:07.229> clean<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.560> it's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
features these completely clean up it's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280 
features these completely clean up it's
hardly<00:01:07.979> turning<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.909> video<00:01:09.290> but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
hardly turning see on this video but

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
hardly turning see on this video but
yeah<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.979> tie<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> definitely<00:01:11.760> new

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
yeah the the tie is definitely new

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.719 
yeah the the tie is definitely new
replacing<00:01:12.900> real<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.710> clean<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
replacing real good clean of this one so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.310 
replacing real good clean of this one so
don't<00:01:15.240> think<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.570> been<00:01:15.689> clean<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:15.930> many

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
don't think it's been clean for many

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.149 
don't think it's been clean for many
many<00:01:16.590> years<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.159> let's<00:01:17.610> crack<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.920> ya<00:01:19.920> see

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
many years so let's crack on and ya see

00:01:20.159 --> 00:02:13.809 
many years so let's crack on and ya see
how<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> comes<00:01:20.490> out

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.199 

okay<00:02:14.819> lots<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.180> frame<00:02:15.390> old<00:02:15.660> stripped<00:02:15.959> down

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
okay lots of frame old stripped down

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.360 
okay lots of frame old stripped down
everything<00:02:18.209> came<00:02:18.450> off<00:02:18.530> fairly<00:02:19.530> okay<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.190> only

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
everything came off fairly okay the only

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.589 
everything came off fairly okay the only
thing<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.730> damaged<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.360> bottom

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
thing that is damaged is the bottom

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.900 
thing that is damaged is the bottom
bracket<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.170> ring<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.190> holds<00:02:23.459> bearings

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
bracket the ring the holds bearings

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.320 
bracket the ring the holds bearings
itself<00:02:24.239> perished<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.770> will<00:02:25.950> read

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
itself perished so that will read

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.890 
itself perished so that will read
replacing<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.480> sure

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
replacing for sure

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.990 
replacing for sure
and<00:02:28.640> yeah<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.850> says<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:31.440> solid<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.130> bear

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
and yeah that says all solid this bear

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.320 
and yeah that says all solid this bear
very<00:02:33.569> little<00:02:34.110> rust<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:35.160> yeah<00:02:35.970> should<00:02:36.209> be<00:02:36.239> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
very little rust so yeah should be a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:03:18.630 
very little rust so yeah should be a
good

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.210 

right<00:03:18.879> okay<00:03:19.269> well<00:03:19.530> here's<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> frame<00:03:20.860> all

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
right okay well here's the frame all

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.710 
right okay well here's the frame all
straight<00:03:21.580> down<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:21.970> all<00:03:22.150> ready<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.510> put

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
straight down it's all ready to be put

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.180 
straight down it's all ready to be put
back<00:03:22.870> together<00:03:23.050> they're<00:03:23.379> all<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.830> equipment

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
back together they're all the equipment

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.250 
back together they're all the equipment
sets<00:03:24.459> out<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.790> side<00:03:25.000> there<00:03:25.360> but<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.870> few<00:03:26.110> issues

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
sets out the side there but a few issues

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.650 
sets out the side there but a few issues
are<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.709> few<00:03:26.920> bits<00:03:27.069> of<00:03:27.220> equipments<00:03:27.819> first<00:03:28.450> one

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
are a few bits of equipments first one

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.479 
are a few bits of equipments first one
was<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.140> crank<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.010> pedal<00:03:30.310> so

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
was the crank and the pedal so

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.300 
was the crank and the pedal so
completely<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.300> release<00:03:31.540> eased<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.890> had

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
completely not release eased on so I had

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.430 
completely not release eased on so I had
to<00:03:33.580> strip<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> pedal<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:34.540> itself<00:03:35.110> we<00:03:35.349> have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
to strip the pedal down itself we have

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.770 
to strip the pedal down itself we have
to<00:03:35.620> file<00:03:35.890> down<00:03:36.099> one<00:03:36.700> side<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.120> get<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.269> good<00:03:37.450> grip

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
to file down one side to get a good grip

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.280 
to file down one side to get a good grip
on<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.290> XOR<00:03:38.500> pedal<00:03:38.739> itself<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.280> heat<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.060> up

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
on the XOR pedal itself and heat it up

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.870 
on the XOR pedal itself and heat it up
lubricate<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.530> let<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.769> cool<00:03:41.950> down<00:03:42.010> heat<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.700> up

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
lubricate it let it cool down heat it up

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.150 
lubricate it let it cool down heat it up
