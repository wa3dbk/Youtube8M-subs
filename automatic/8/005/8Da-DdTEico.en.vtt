00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello people i have for today again 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 a quicktipp for you and that would like 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
 I introduce you to this book from here 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.250
 franziska schmidt and stefanie katharina 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 mÃ¤hring, and that is the name of the book seven 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.359
 days green green smoothies and raw food 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.119
 and it's about seven days 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.039
 Experiment where you just sort of green things 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.990
 is for example the earliest like salads 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.400
 soups and so on and that's one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.199
 Great book I've been for now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.800
 recently I want you very briefly 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.530
 to the content of the book and that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.879
 There are interesting recipes to go 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 In any case, as I said first order 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.050
 green smoothies what about green smoothies 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 are how they are prepared especially 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.719
 the composition of the 57 percent fruit 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 50 percent green leafy vegetables for 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.989
 example wild herbs salad around under 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.820
 another example is this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.609
 trend explains why, for example 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 the whole stars he with his green 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.170
 smoothie encircling city with cafe 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.909
 latte or something like that a green week 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 makes in my eyes then sense if you 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.210
 for example, has chronic diseases 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 So somehow they are celts now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.939
 really for weeks with him 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.259
 I'll drag it along and I want that very well 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.909
 or if you just think of yourself 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.790
 you know you have a weak immune system 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 you want to build that or you plan 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.939
 for example, a diet change 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.380
 if you can not cure it then you can 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.200
 you try it with something like that is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 actually nothing in principle 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 great others like basenfasten over 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 By the way, then synonymous videos 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.689
 will do exactly and then will as well 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 still on which which 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.130
 Mixa can and can be used though 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.509
 also said that also normal mixa 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.549
 can be used but there are 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.369
 of course one or the other of the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.430
 quality such smoothies just yet 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.380
 better 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.270
 the simply higher quality 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.680
 makes movies and on the other hand must 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.690
 one does not always wait until 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.040
 it has something that you really his 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.600
 takes health in hand and then 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.400
 Maybe seven days fasted or 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.990
 Not at all that's not it 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.940
 book it now somehow diseases 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.770
 it's supposed to heal but green smoothies are 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.880
 a perfect time you just 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 for example, to work in the morning 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.120
 that's easy 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.800
 fast breakfast so in principle are 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.290
 Green smoothies, too, something for everyone 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.600
 Lazy people who do not feel great about 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.980
 Chew great to have something to cook 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.310
 it must be really great with a book 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.770
 very inviting recipes and yes there are 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.770
 so also salads for example or 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.300
 Here are for example they smoothies 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.840
 do not always have to be green eg the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.420
 Classic with spinach apples bananas 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.390
 bit of avocado ginger and lemon 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.910
 So most of them are set up and yes 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.239
 So I like it very much I drink 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.070
 also relatively often or even if 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.840
 I for example do not pick up time so 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.610
 Today I have my turn day and turn 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.640
 I have been pretty long and when I am 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.660
 I do not feel like it anymore 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.030
 Great to eat because I have that now 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.799
 easy now just want to turn and 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.540
 do not cook and so on we want 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.950
 just made greens profi and then as 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.780
 I take my videos from the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.250
 Memory card pulled on the pc citizen 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.019
 I just quickly got in 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.630
 the second round is done a lot so go 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.519
 actually really quite fix and wanted 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.320
 and quickly finished that's why I wanted 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.239
 Here's this book seven days green 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.860
 Imagine and I will do it again 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.510
