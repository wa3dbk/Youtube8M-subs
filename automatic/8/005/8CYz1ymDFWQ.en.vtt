00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.399
 all right 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.779
 Youtube economics welcome other 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.520
 video on your planet x channel in this 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.400
 I bring you a small video 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.960
 a tutorial on how to change what 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.480
 It is the text of our screen 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 lock that good by default says 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.460
 slide to unlock 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 first of all, as you know 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.850
 some of the tics had been 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.420
 incompatible but already eating begin 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.400
 to come out what are the compatible and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 well we look for in that line they are left 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.770
 only that is the jailbreak that for what 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.430
 is ios 7 and we are going to enter what is to go 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.660
 already 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.590
 obviously we have to have our 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.020
 device with jailbreak 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.020
 let's let it load what it is to go 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 all we have to do is the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.489
 tabs that are below go to the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.100
 last that says look 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.860
 and without adding any repo we are going to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.860
 write only what script tour 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.550
 basically we are going to install what is 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.550
 this tweet 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.420
 as I told them and they start to come out 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.820
 what are the clicks compatible with this 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 system is going to be what is a process and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.250
 will ask us to restart what is the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.250
 device 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.159
 once our device has 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:53.909
 rebooted will show us good will appear 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.670
 what is this status that will appear 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.530
 deactivated and we even go to another text 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.259
 here as you can tell, says a 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.110
 lot planet x I had already used what 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.080
 what is this method 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.030
 but well basically we're going to 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.310
 let's unlock what is our 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.940
 device let's go into what is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.940
 settings 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.270
 let's modify what the text is 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 to customize it according to you 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.180
 they want to show us what is another 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.220
 option in the settings menu and good 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.280
 here in the second option above for 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.380
 text me for example as I mentioned them 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.550

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.290

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.280
 device we can only 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.020
