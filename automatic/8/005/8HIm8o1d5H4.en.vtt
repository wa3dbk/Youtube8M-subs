00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.280
 hello to all friends this is the king 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.920
 rather today we think we are 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.590
 a first video on the chain the king 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.350
 rather where I write his chain to be 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.920
 mediator has not 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.640
 but 2010 is not the subject today 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.760
 it's very healthy a super simple subject 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.460
 always shown product so that's going on 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.969
 on a global offensive loss so 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.390
 so on counter strike 1.6 if there 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.449
 had a console that works and we 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.969
 press on the small 2 at the top left 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.940
 from top to bottom of escapes 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.449
 no y'a and a little 2 click on it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.550
 there is the console that now 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.409
 we know from prom to festive so says 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.149
 yes to the shower but it does not work 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.090
 so today I'm going to 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.000
 explain how to make it work so 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.340
 it would be super simple so if you have 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.960
 killed the console in the video but if 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.799
 but if you want it's a bit the case 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.009
 so then you are stewart esteem yourself 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.960
 have you studied first steve good for 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.209
 the cracked versions I do not know so 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.930
 so here is the full version 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:39.500
 buy our sails instead 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.010
 so right click on counter strike 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.010
 global offensive 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.170
 property 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.439
 so you 've all adopted watch out of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.549
 set the launch options so that 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.039
 will be the description you type tabby 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.640
 console you do at the dock is closed 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:07.659
 you launch the game or not the console to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.519
 share and live so I'm going to show you 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.700
 so we find ourselves right away in 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.700
 the game
