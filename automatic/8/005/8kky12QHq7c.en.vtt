00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
I'm going to be starting a new

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.640 
I'm going to be starting a new
walkthrough<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
walkthrough and this is going to be a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.860 
walkthrough and this is going to be a
walkthrough<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> side<00:00:11.580> quest<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
walkthrough of the side quest for the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.460 
walkthrough of the side quest for the
companions<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.420> didn't<00:00:15.929> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.379> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
companions now I didn't want to do it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.200 
companions now I didn't want to do it
for<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> main<00:00:16.859> questline<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.789> figured

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
for the main questline because I figured

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480 
for the main questline because I figured
it<00:00:18.449> would<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.720> way<00:00:18.990> too<00:00:19.020> long<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it would be way too long and so I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.090 
it would be way too long and so I
decided<00:00:20.910> why<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.830> side

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
decided why not just do it for the side

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 
decided why not just do it for the side
quests<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.640> aren't<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.090> long<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
quests which aren't as long but are just

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
quests which aren't as long but are just
as<00:00:25.320> entertaining<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.099> he's<00:00:26.250> also<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.880> some

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
as entertaining and he's also get some

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.769 
as entertaining and he's also get some
very<00:00:27.330> cool<00:00:27.570> stuff<00:00:27.869> from<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> figured<00:00:29.779> I'd

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
very cool stuff from so I figured I'd

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
very cool stuff from so I figured I'd
start<00:00:31.170> off<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.560> doing<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> companions<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
start off with doing the companions and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
start off with doing the companions and
next<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.000> most<00:00:33.329> likely<00:00:33.600> move<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
next I will most likely move on to the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.990 
next I will most likely move on to the
stormcloaks<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.540> potentially<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
stormcloaks and potentially the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
stormcloaks and potentially the
potentially<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.780> College<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> Winterhold

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
potentially do the College of Winterhold

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.569 
potentially do the College of Winterhold
later<00:00:41.579> I'm<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.390> too<00:00:42.629> sure<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.739> am<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.430> if

of useless like give them their shields
and<00:01:18.330> stuff<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.020> decided<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> skip<00:01:19.799> through

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and stuff so I decided to skip through

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.570 
and stuff so I decided to skip through
that<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:21.030> straight<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:23.009> quest

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that and just go straight to the quest

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.760 
that and just go straight to the quest
so<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> first<00:01:24.869> quest<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.380> doing<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so this is the first quest I'm doing I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
so this is the first quest I'm doing I
think<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.189> Vilkas<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.240> Farkas<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
think it's for Vilkas or for Farkas and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.560 
think it's for Vilkas or for Farkas and
I'm<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.130> doing<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.520> after<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> do

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I'm just doing it because after you do

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.249 
I'm just doing it because after you do
this<00:01:30.799> you<00:01:31.909> get<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:34.170> they

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this you get I think you I think they

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
this you get I think you I think they
let<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.560> into<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> companions<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
let you into the companions and then you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.690 
let you into the companions and then you
start<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> real<00:01:36.600> quest<00:01:37.049> line<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.700> that's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
start on the real quest line so that's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.420 
start on the real quest line so that's
exactly<00:01:39.180> why<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.630> doing<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.430> I'm

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
exactly why I'm doing this right now I'm

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.719 
exactly why I'm doing this right now I'm
gonna<00:01:41.579> scavenge<00:01:42.240> around<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> lot

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
gonna scavenge around for up for a lot

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.080 
gonna scavenge around for up for a lot
of<00:01:44.880> things<00:01:45.210> guys<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.049> game<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.090> it'll

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
of things guys in this game so it'll

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.760 
of things guys in this game so it'll
probably<00:01:48.329> end<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.869> being<00:01:49.110> longer<00:01:49.320> than<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
probably end up being longer than it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940 
probably end up being longer than it
actually<00:01:49.920> needs<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.610> oh<00:01:50.820> wow<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.920> is

actually needs to be oh wow so this is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.700 
actually needs to be oh wow so this is
the<00:01:53.070> first<00:01:53.399> quest<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.600> had<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> come<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the first quest I just had to come and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.709 
the first quest I just had to come and
get<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.219> guy<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.350> I

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
get this guy and that was it so I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.030 
get this guy and that was it so I
thought<00:02:00.719> I'd<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.469> into<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> cave<00:02:01.979> or

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that was the first time i did this on my

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.130 
that was the first time i did this on my
first<00:04:45.370> character<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.030> i<00:04:46.060> played<00:04:46.330> with<00:04:46.480> but

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
first character that i played with but

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.670 
first character that i played with but
this<00:04:47.290> is<00:04:47.380> my<00:04:47.500> second<00:04:47.950> one<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.430> i<00:04:49.620> chose<00:04:50.620> a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
this is my second one so i chose a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.510 
this is my second one so i chose a
different<00:04:50.919> quest<00:04:51.460> this<00:04:51.640> time<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:54.190> i<00:04:54.220> think

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
different quest this time but i think

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.600 
different quest this time but i think
this<00:04:54.700> quest<00:04:55.630> took<00:04:55.990> got<00:04:56.410> not<00:04:56.740> too<00:04:57.010> long<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:57.580> i

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
this quest took got not too long but i

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.530 
this quest took got not too long but i
think<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.060> took<00:04:58.330> long<00:04:58.630> enough<00:04:59.130> so<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.160> I<00:05:00.820> I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
think it took long enough so that I I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.330 
think it took long enough so that I I
can<00:05:01.900> make<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.169> into<00:05:02.440> its<00:05:02.590> own<00:05:02.740> little<00:05:02.950> video

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
can make this into its own little video

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.560 
can make this into its own little video
so<00:05:03.700> once<00:05:04.360> i<00:05:04.540> escort<00:05:05.440> him<00:05:05.650> back<00:05:05.680> home<00:05:06.220> i<00:05:06.669> will

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
so once i escort him back home i will

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.740 
so once i escort him back home i will
most<00:05:07.840> likely<00:05:08.080> end<00:05:08.410> this<00:05:08.560> video<00:05:08.919> so<00:05:09.910> uh<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.479> do

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750
