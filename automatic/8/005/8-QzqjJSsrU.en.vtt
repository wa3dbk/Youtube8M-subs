 Hello, friends, how are you doing? 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.770
 Today I bring you some super 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.079
 hd transitions for your sony vegas are 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.140
 very good transitions the link in 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.329
 the description before showing them them 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 I warn you will be asked to install the kit 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.170
 time so you guys have to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 install and open the format of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.579
 transitions with the quit time good without 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.280
 more than saying I leave you a demonstration 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.010
 and at the end of the video a small step 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.909
 to work them without mistakes we 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.909
 we see right away 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.920
 i 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.060
 good friends so only s shown 12 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.940
 transitions of the 100 there are the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.950
 transitions are very good hd I know the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.200
 I recommend and now a small tutorial 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.920
 so that the transitions fit well 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 and not like that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.370
 so they will look bad as they see in the video 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.519
 the solution is to go to the transition to give 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.470
 right click go to media and where it says 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.400
 alpha channel will see that option and with 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 clean regular 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.040
 this is not all once you have 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.780
 installed the time kit the files les 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.870
 will appear to open with the format 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.030
 point wmv or whatever what they have to 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.340
 do is give right click to the file 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.409

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.420

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.100
 selected file and right there
