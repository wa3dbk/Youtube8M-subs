00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.540
 Hello boys! How are you? It's me Juan Andres 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.500
 and this is "Drawing My Life" I hope you like it! 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.700
 I was born on April 22, 1987 in Venezuela 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 My parents fell in love very young 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.200
 and my mom had me when I was 20 

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:17.495
 I was not planned but here I am :) 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.760
 she is from Portugal (Madeira) and my dad is from Venezuela 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.080
 so I'm half latin and half european 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320
 my parents had 2 babies apart from me 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.740
 therefore I have 2 sisters 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.080
 my dad was a surfer and decided to name me by a beach called Juan AndrÃ©s 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.660
 that's where my name comes from :) 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.160
 When I was in preschool I did not talk much with other children 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.560
 so while they played normal things 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.600
 I remember being under the table drawing and imagining a fantastic world 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.120
 I grew up loving the drawing 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 so my mom told me that if I did my homework I could first draw everything I wanted 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.660
 I was a very good student thanks to that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.320
 I remember seeing all my favorite shows in the afternoon 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.760
 I started to become a big fan of the anime 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.320
 I watched anime all the time 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 The first one I saw was Dragon Ball 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.900
 after that I liked everyone 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.560
 Sailor Moon, Saint Seiya, Rurouni Kenshin, Sakura Card Captors, Slayers, TODOOS! 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.940
 THE ANIME INSPIRED ME A LOT! 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.960
 I became an Otaku and that made me a better artist 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 Time passed and one day I was in my aunt's house 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.540
 eating pasta and the TV was on 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 suddenly began to listen to a girl sing 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.260
 was Christina Aguilera and her song Trapped Genius 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 I immediately fell in love with her 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 his voice inspired me in a way I did not know how to describe 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.620
 she became my love platonico and began to make portraits of her every day 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.140
 so start making more realistic drawings 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.300
 I was doing better and better in the drawing practicing daily 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.860
 I was always shy and calm and that's why they bothered me at the lyceum 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.080
 at that point in my life I did not understand why some are bad with others 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.800
 but when that happened I talked to the director and they did not bother me later ... 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.740
 my favorite subject in high school was Chemistry 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 I liked everything about her 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.200
 It was good to create formulas and knowing the elements of the periodic table 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.280
 When I finished high school my parents did not have money to pay for my career in arts 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.640
 I was very sad because I did not know what to do with my life 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.080
 I started thinking about my country and how the oil industry is big here 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.200
 so I decided to present at a public university to study chemical engineering 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.520
 because he was good at chemistry 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.440
 I was accepted but after 2 years waking up at 4:00 am and traveling to another city every day 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.680
 I was exhausted and depressed because I did not do anything with my drawings 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.640
 in 2006 create my YouTube channel with the username jardc87 which are the initials of my name 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.740
 and 87 is my year of birth 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.700
 I started recording my videos holding the camera with my left hand 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420
 It was hard to do 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.980
 My first video was a Naruto character, I've always been anime fan and Naruto was great! 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.900
 to make things easier I bought a tripod and the videos looked much better without the shaking of my hand 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.360
 seeing all the good comments about my work inspired me to do more and more videos ... 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.260
 I found an amazing place to share my work 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.140
 I was wondering, Art or Chemical Engineering? 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.540
 I said goodbye to chemistry and decided to follow my heart! 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.160
 Maybe he did not have money but when you follow your heart miracles can happen ... 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.980
 I received a scholarship to study Social Communication and that was closer to the things that I like to do 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.560
 after a couple of years another miracle happened 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.880
 I was looking for a place to learn how to make better video editions 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.380
 and I went to a place here in Venezuela called Dr Graphic, they saw my work and they liked it 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.440
 and they decided to give me a diploma to learn VFX (Visual Effects) FREE! : D 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.780
 at that time I got to know my favorite programs After Effects and Adobe Photoshop 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.980
 and that gave me the opportunity to go from traditional to digital 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.340
 When I was about to finish my diploma, my girlfriend and I finished, I was very sad 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.000
 but I do not like being sad so I decided to turn that sadness into creative energy 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.520
 I was thinking of creating something that would express my feelings for the final project 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.060
 and since the music inspires me more than anything I decided to make a video clip in motion graphic 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.920
 I was looking for the song and one day my cousin was listening to music and I asked Who is he? 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.100
 She told me: Justin Bieber 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.580
 and listen to the album My World 2.0 and a song attracted my attention 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.560
 the song is called "That Should Be Me" 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.620
 I made a video clip with my cousin and Justin and uploaded it to YouTube on December 31, 2010 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.560
 the next day BANG! another miracle happened! 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.700
 Justin shared my video on Twitter, Facebook and placed it on his YouTube channel as an official 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.000
 I started to tremble and I did not believe it, because it seems incredible how the internet can connect people from all over the world 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.720
 that changed my life as it opened many doors for me, so THANK YOU JUSTIN AND SCOOTER! 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.060
 for everything they did! I will be Belieber forever! :) 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 since that moment I have been working every day making art in every possible way and sharing it in my channel so you can enjoy it 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.860
 my dream to move to the United States, especially to Los Angeles and work with Disney 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.740
 I'm a big fan of everything they do! I hope to be able to collaborate on a project someday! 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.560
 What I have learned from life is that you must always follow your heart 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.280
 because when you follow your heart life flows on the right path 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.000
 with God's help EVERYTHING can happen 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.900
 Meanwhile I will be doing more and more videos for you because it is what I like to do the most 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.600
 thank you very much from the bottom of my heart! for all your support! 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.700
 AdioOoOsss! ;)
