00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.500
 The guys are okay, I'm so freaking 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.099
 books and mountains 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 Welcome to my good channel, I 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.859
 wanted to talk a little bit about why 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.600
 I made this channel because I did my blog myself 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.359
 I used to do diaries when I was older. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.240
 new since 87 daily 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.880
 there was a time in time ago I stopped 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.949
 to write is that pass time had 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 longer be writing for weapons 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.739
 I really like writing diaries and tv in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.520
 2007 I even made a blog that I 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.020
 I wanted to talk about the mountain and such 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.000
 It turned out I made a post 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.399
 Leave it to me, if it's not fun without it. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.079
 afraid of what people would say 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.850
 such and ended up leaving the next blog and 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.309
 lately I've seen quite a lot 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.460
 literary channels some blogs well 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.390
 so they have to confess that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 I was white with envy too 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 comment on my readings and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.840
 also to comment on the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 my adventures 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.670
 then so I went looking there 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 I was going to make a blog and such is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.130
 I discovered he'd still have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.960
 Then I re-activated the blog there. 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 because the name free software of 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.270
 mountains 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.310
 before it was called patchwork, do not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.890
 among the books and mountains to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.439
 talk about these two passions which are some 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 books and the mountain 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.710
 so I'm here making music 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.409
 I hope you all enjoy it 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.939
 please comment tell me that you 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.890
 encourage them to continue speech 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.709
 To me what are you liking that? 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.409
 You're not liking me, always. 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:06.329
 reviews very well in 40 homes but in this 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.549
 very cool and has few people to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.679
 talk about books I really like 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.269
 talk about books showing the knife in 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.780
 A crazy 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.940
 people drift away and I think 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.400
 that because of this my eagerness to get 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.319
 talking about free and also for 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.840
 participate in adventure 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.000
 With you I think it's going to be really cool, I 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.870
 I'd hate to write a lot at the beginning. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.269
 daily was half before the rubin but later 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 It was cool, I described all the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.900
 my adventures were cool 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.850
 all of a sudden this is a way of doing 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.410
 retake a diary 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.569
 Of course it will not be day by day so 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.280
 I do not know what else I'll put here 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.709
 my impressions and I hope everyone 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.170
 you okay there also are welcome 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.579
 Monteiro students can love each other a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.579
 pretty quiet kiss
