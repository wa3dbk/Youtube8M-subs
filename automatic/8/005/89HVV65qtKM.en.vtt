00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:03.689
 and 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.879
 hello how about you guys and let's see two 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.199
 very good tricks here in transit and 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.520
 let's take a look at the wall 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.070
 it's because a lot of people think it's 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.539
 patched and is appear disappears follows 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.910
 as you can always enter 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.829
 the unit and cÃ¡ceres is to place the 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.109
 turbine put us back to the 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.669
 equipped shield align the peephole with 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.589
 the curb to make sure that 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.420
 we are straight to give the joystick towards 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.210
 back to move and press the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.650
 square to exchange objects 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.500
 you have to insist you will not go to the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.239
 first if you get yourself you are a fucking machine 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.090
 but hey a little bit of cannes and nery 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.980
 So we get all it does not matter one 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.109
 time this world was the idea would be 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.789
 block the two roads that there are to the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.109
 entrance to the catwalk of that and so 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.210
 quietly the other two can 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.030
 be in the middle buying infinite m16 and 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.680
 killing to slaughter if by the one that was 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.230
 only were unable to leave the one 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.730
 you also have the option to block a 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.460
 of the tickets and that the others 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.840
 are locked in the corner and as 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.950
 if there was not a tomorrow what happens is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.720
 that way you know that if you run out 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.800
 ammunition without anything and you do not leave because 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.929
 when you go through the two 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.789
 visitors are going to burst so nothing 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.349
