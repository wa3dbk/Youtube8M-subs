weeks<00:00:45.780> we've<00:00:46.170> been<00:00:46.200> working<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.830> a<00:00:47.220> process

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
weeks we've been working with a process

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.950 
weeks we've been working with a process
called<00:00:48.090> reciprocal<00:00:48.840> teaching<00:00:49.290> and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
called reciprocal teaching and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
called reciprocal teaching and
reciprocal<00:00:51.960> teaching<00:00:52.290> has<00:00:52.440> four<00:00:52.890> phases<00:00:53.580> four

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
reciprocal teaching has four phases four

like you take a guess about what the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
like you take a guess about what the
text<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.430> gonna<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.820> okay<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.720> guessing

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
text is gonna be okay you're guessing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
text is gonna be okay you're guessing
what<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.260> text<00:01:16.620> is<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.980> be<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
what the text is going to be about and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
what the text is going to be about and
you're<00:01:18.090> using<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.230> cover<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.250> cover

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
text to kind of take a guess like you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
text to kind of take a guess like you
said<00:01:25.860> about<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.970> text<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
said about what the text is going to be

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200 
said about what the text is going to be
about<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.950> reciprocal<00:01:29.460> teaching<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
about now in reciprocal teaching you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
about now in reciprocal teaching you
actually<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.470> before<00:01:32.220> reading

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
actually take your before reading

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
actually take your before reading
prediction<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.690> then<00:01:34.229> afterwards<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
prediction and then afterwards you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
prediction and then afterwards you
confirm<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> reject<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.000> prediction<00:01:36.479> after

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
confirm a reject your prediction after

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
confirm a reject your prediction after
you've<00:01:36.870> read<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.170> text<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.100> before<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you've read the text so before you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
you've read the text so before you
rather<00:01:38.700> read<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> text<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.870> make<00:01:40.020> your

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
rather read the text you make your

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.500 
rather read the text you make your
prediction<00:01:40.590> after<00:01:41.340> reading<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:42.090> confirm

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
prediction after reading it you confirm

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.350 
prediction after reading it you confirm
or<00:01:42.540> reject<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.620> prediction<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:45.210> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
or reject you your prediction what is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.430 
or reject you your prediction what is
the<00:01:45.540> next<00:01:45.810> stage<00:01:46.260> in<00:01:46.620> reciprocal<00:01:47.190> teaching

questions<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:07.069> where<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.819> place

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
questions like where is this place

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.899 
questions like where is this place
located<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.769> word<00:02:11.129> mean<00:02:11.159> I'm

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
located or what does this word mean I'm

located or what does this word mean I'm
really<00:02:12.480> confused<00:02:12.959> about<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.590> part<00:02:14.010> so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
really confused about this part so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.720 
really confused about this part so
that's<00:02:15.090> how<00:02:15.599> you're<00:02:15.840> clarifying<00:02:16.530> things<00:02:17.459> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
that's how you're clarifying things that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
to share I know I thought that the job

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.530 
to share I know I thought that the job
we<00:04:32.320> read<00:04:32.530> about<00:04:32.740> how<00:04:33.220> they<00:04:33.430> first<00:04:34.180> bought<00:04:34.390> the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
we read about how they first bought the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.170 
we read about how they first bought the
space<00:04:34.950> because<00:04:35.950> because<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.850> federal

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
space because because the federal

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.880 
space because because the federal
shootings<00:04:37.480> laws<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.170> you<00:04:38.290> can't<00:04:38.500> really<00:04:38.650> go

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
shootings laws but you can't really go

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.920 
shootings laws but you can't really go
to<00:04:38.950> stars<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.670> I<00:04:39.880> thought<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.210> they<00:04:40.750> met

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930

of<00:04:44.170> text<00:04:44.560> was<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:45.070> thought<00:04:45.640> this<00:04:45.850> text<00:04:46.240> was

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
of text was I thought this text was

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.880 
of text was I thought this text was
going<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.690> be<00:04:46.810> about<00:04:46.930> different<00:04:47.380> types<00:04:47.800> of

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
going to be about different types of

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.040 
going to be about different types of
stars<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.520> how<00:04:48.940> they<00:04:48.970> are<00:04:49.210> identified<00:04:49.750> I

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
stars and how they are identified I

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.380 
stars and how they are identified I
predicted<00:04:50.890> this<00:04:51.070> because<00:04:51.460> in<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.760> title<00:04:52.180> it

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
predicted this because in the title it

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.750 
predicted this because in the title it
contains<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.870> word<00:04:53.020> stars<00:04:53.460> also<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.490> skim

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
contains the word stars also I skim

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.400 
contains the word stars also I skim
through<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.150> text<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.810> saw<00:04:55.960> pictures<00:04:56.170> of

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
through the text and I saw pictures of

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.130 
through the text and I saw pictures of
animals<00:04:56.920> I<00:04:57.340> know<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:58.060> constellations<00:04:58.810> create

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
animals I know the constellations create

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.380 
animals I know the constellations create
images<00:04:59.710> when<00:05:00.190> our<00:05:00.310> only<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.640> animals<00:05:01.180> but<00:05:01.360> also

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
images when our only of animals but also

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.470 
images when our only of animals but also
objects<00:05:02.280> lastly<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.310> saw<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> picture<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.210> boy

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
objects lastly I saw a picture of a boy

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.580 
objects lastly I saw a picture of a boy
and<00:05:04.780> a<00:05:04.900> girl

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
and a girl

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.010 
and a girl

using space technologies to look in the
sky<00:05:08.350> which<00:05:08.980> looks<00:05:09.220> like<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.460> photo<00:05:09.730> stars

prediction when I said in the text would

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.200 
prediction when I said in the text would
be<00:05:19.330> about<00:05:19.750> stars<00:05:20.110> because<00:05:20.820> inside<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.970> test

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
be about stars because inside the test

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.110 
be about stars because inside the test
it<00:05:22.480> um<00:05:22.810> did<00:05:23.350> talk<00:05:23.590> about<00:05:23.890> different<00:05:24.669> tons<00:05:24.910> of

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
it um did talk about different tons of

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.200 
it um did talk about different tons of
stars<00:05:25.419> I<00:05:25.750> would<00:05:26.650> also<00:05:27.160> like<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.520> reject<00:05:28.030> my

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
stars I would also like to reject my

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.240 
stars I would also like to reject my
preferred<00:05:28.690> way<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:28.930> predicting<00:05:29.380> when<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:29.890> said

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
preferred way of predicting when I said

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.490 
preferred way of predicting when I said
it<00:05:30.460> would<00:05:30.730> be<00:05:30.910> about<00:05:31.120> shooting<00:05:31.450> stars<00:05:31.750> because

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
it would be about shooting stars because

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.590 
it would be about shooting stars because
it<00:05:32.740> wasn't<00:05:33.160> about<00:05:33.250> shooting<00:05:33.700> stars<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.270> it

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
it wasn't about shooting stars and it

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.780 
it wasn't about shooting stars and it
wasn't<00:05:34.870> only<00:05:35.169> about<00:05:35.320> stars<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:36.220> would<00:05:36.520> like<00:05:36.669> to

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
wasn't only about stars I would like to

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.090 
wasn't only about stars I would like to
confirm<00:05:37.000> my<00:05:37.300> prediction<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.770> was<00:05:38.890> about

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
confirm my prediction that it was about

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.190 
confirm my prediction that it was about
stars<00:05:39.490> however<00:05:39.940> it<00:05:40.390> was<00:05:40.510> also<00:05:40.690> about<00:05:40.990> how

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
stars however it was also about how

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.190 
stars however it was also about how
students<00:05:41.860> make<00:05:42.070> rockets<00:05:42.820> and<00:05:43.060> a<00:05:43.270> timeline<00:05:44.140> of

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
students make rockets and a timeline of

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.840 
students make rockets and a timeline of
space<00:05:44.919> I<00:05:45.340> did<00:05:46.270> not<00:05:46.390> predict<00:05:46.750> that<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.200> yes

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
space I did not predict that so yes

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.430 
space I did not predict that so yes
does<00:05:48.850> anyone<00:05:49.120> have<00:05:49.419> any<00:05:49.570> clarifying<00:05:50.140> that

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
does anyone have any clarifying that

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.409 
does anyone have any clarifying that
they<00:05:50.620> were

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
they were

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.240 
they were
like<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.960> know<00:05:52.110> about<00:05:52.560> words<00:05:53.069> or<00:05:53.689> text<00:05:54.860> on<00:05:55.860> page

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
like to know about words or text on page

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.450 
like to know about words or text on page
14<00:05:56.969> and<00:05:57.330> one<00:05:58.259> of<00:05:58.379> the<00:05:58.500> stories<00:05:58.919> it<00:05:59.189> all

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
14 and one of the stories it all

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.029 
14 and one of the stories it all
mentioned<00:06:00.030> Jupiter<00:06:00.599> I<00:06:00.810> like<00:06:01.289> to<00:06:01.439> know<00:06:01.620> what<00:06:01.830> um

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
mentioned Jupiter I like to know what um

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.029 
mentioned Jupiter I like to know what um
Jupiter<00:06:02.789> is<00:06:03.060> is<00:06:03.360> it<00:06:03.629> a<00:06:03.780> name<00:06:04.020> or<00:06:04.229> advance<00:06:04.590> I

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
Jupiter is is it a name or advance I

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.809 
Jupiter is is it a name or advance I
think<00:06:05.550> that<00:06:05.969> Jupiter<00:06:06.539> is<00:06:06.599> actually<00:06:07.169> um<00:06:07.819> named

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
think that Jupiter is actually um named

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.020 
think that Jupiter is actually um named
after<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.689> planet<00:06:10.289> but<00:06:10.560> it's<00:06:10.830> actually<00:06:11.310> named

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
after a planet but it's actually named

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.790 
after a planet but it's actually named
as<00:06:12.210> a<00:06:12.240> God<00:06:12.539> because<00:06:12.900> it<00:06:13.020> says<00:06:13.199> the<00:06:13.349> king<00:06:13.530> of<00:06:13.650> the

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
as a God because it says the king of the

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.159 
as a God because it says the king of the
gods<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.280> Jupiter<00:06:15.030> as<00:06:15.240> we<00:06:15.449> all<00:06:15.569> know<00:06:15.750> is<00:06:15.960> one

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
gods and Jupiter as we all know is one

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.480 
gods and Jupiter as we all know is one
of<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.379> biggest<00:06:16.560> planets<00:06:17.099> in<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.310> solar

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
of the biggest planets in the solar

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.429 
of the biggest planets in the solar
system<00:06:17.789> so<00:06:18.240> that's<00:06:18.780> probably<00:06:19.080> why<00:06:19.289> they

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
system so that's probably why they

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:20.929 
system so that's probably why they
called<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.889> king<00:06:20.099> because<00:06:20.430> Jupiter<00:06:20.879> is

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:20.939 
called it the king because Jupiter is

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.920 
called it the king because Jupiter is
also<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.659> biggest<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.319> look<00:06:22.919> I<00:06:23.129> wondered<00:06:23.669> Oh

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
also the biggest I look I wondered Oh

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.230 
also the biggest I look I wondered Oh
what<00:06:24.930> does<00:06:25.139> a<00:06:25.169> phase<00:06:25.529> and<00:06:25.800> they<00:06:26.520> could<00:06:26.729> I<00:06:26.909> mean

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
what does a phase and they could I mean

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.010 
what does a phase and they could I mean
on<00:06:27.449> page<00:06:28.169> 15<00:06:28.710> I<00:06:28.949> think<00:06:29.039> that<00:06:29.580> naked<00:06:30.449> eye<00:06:30.689> means

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
on page 15 I think that naked eye means

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.019 
on page 15 I think that naked eye means
that<00:06:31.349> without<00:06:32.219> using<00:06:32.370> anything<00:06:32.729> like

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
that without using anything like

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.019 
that without using anything like
telescopes<00:06:33.419> because<00:06:34.219> the<00:06:35.219> plastic<00:06:35.610> surgeries

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
telescopes because the plastic surgeries

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.850 
telescopes because the plastic surgeries
when<00:06:36.210> using<00:06:36.659> things<00:06:36.810> to<00:06:36.990> enhance<00:06:37.139> the<00:06:37.590> way<00:06:37.710> we

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
when using things to enhance the way we

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.209 
when using things to enhance the way we
look<00:06:37.979> at<00:06:38.099> space<00:06:39.590> that's<00:06:40.590> right<00:06:40.830> and<00:06:40.979> in<00:06:41.039> this

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
look at space that's right and in this

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:42.679 
look at space that's right and in this
section<00:06:41.699> of<00:06:41.939> the<00:06:42.060> text

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
section of the text

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:46.550 
section of the text
it's<00:06:42.840> about<00:06:43.729> Galileo<00:06:44.840> before<00:06:45.840> he<00:06:45.990> created<00:06:46.319> the

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
it's about Galileo before he created the

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.929 
it's about Galileo before he created the
telescope<00:06:47.039> so<00:06:47.189> before<00:06:47.520> he<00:06:47.580> created<00:06:47.729> the

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939 
telescope so before he created the

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.899 
telescope so before he created the
telescope<00:06:48.449> there<00:06:48.960> were<00:06:49.110> no<00:06:49.550> technology<00:06:50.550> so<00:06:50.759> we

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
telescope there were no technology so we

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.760 
telescope there were no technology so we
would<00:06:51.060> use<00:06:51.240> a<00:06:51.270> naked<00:06:51.629> eye<00:06:51.719> phone<00:06:51.960> I<00:06:52.169> would<00:06:52.620> also

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
would use a naked eye phone I would also

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.510 
would use a naked eye phone I would also
like<00:06:53.069> to<00:06:53.129> know<00:06:53.370> what<00:06:53.550> multistage<00:06:54.210> means<00:06:54.569> I

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
like to know what multistage means I

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.820 
like to know what multistage means I
think<00:06:56.520> that<00:06:56.639> multistage<00:06:57.240> means<00:06:57.690> that<00:06:58.199> there

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
think that multistage means that there

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.070 
think that multistage means that there
are<00:06:58.979> many<00:06:59.279> stages<00:06:59.669> because<00:07:00.180> I<00:07:00.629> prior

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
are many stages because I prior

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.140 
are many stages because I prior
knowledge<00:07:01.349> I<00:07:01.770> know<00:07:01.830> that<00:07:02.129> the<00:07:02.430> word<00:07:02.610> multi

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
knowledge I know that the word multi

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.059 
knowledge I know that the word multi
means<00:07:03.870> many<00:07:04.199> I<00:07:06.229> like<00:07:07.229> to<00:07:07.349> add<00:07:07.469> on<00:07:07.620> to<00:07:07.830> what<00:07:07.860> the

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:08.069 
means many I like to add on to what the

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.969 
means many I like to add on to what the
method<00:07:08.370> said<00:07:08.580> because<00:07:09.509> in<00:07:09.930> the<00:07:10.379> picture<00:07:10.800> you

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
method said because in the picture you

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.149 
method said because in the picture you
can<00:07:11.129> see<00:07:11.159> that<00:07:11.960> promise<00:07:12.960> dropping<00:07:13.500> different

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:14.159 
can see that promise dropping different

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:16.579 
can see that promise dropping different
parts<00:07:14.430> of<00:07:14.520> it<00:07:14.990> there's<00:07:15.990> different<00:07:16.259> parts<00:07:16.379> with

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:16.589 
parts of it there's different parts with

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.279 
parts of it there's different parts with
the<00:07:16.680> body<00:07:16.860> of<00:07:16.979> the<00:07:17.069> rocket<00:07:17.279> so<00:07:18.029> that<00:07:18.300> it<00:07:19.169> has

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:19.289 
the body of the rocket so that it has

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:20.809 
the body of the rocket so that it has
enough<00:07:19.319> fuel<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:19.860> make<00:07:20.069> it<00:07:20.189> all<00:07:20.310> the<00:07:20.339> way<00:07:20.460> to

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
enough fuel to make it all the way to

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.419 
enough fuel to make it all the way to
long
