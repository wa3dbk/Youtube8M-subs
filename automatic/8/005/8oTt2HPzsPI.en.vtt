the second model of our range this is

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.150 
the second model of our range this is
the<00:00:19.210> pressure<00:00:19.720> treated<00:00:19.990> bearers<00:00:20.470> going<00:00:21.040> on<00:00:21.130> a

up to strips to go on top of the bearers
very<00:00:32.650> important<00:00:32.949> you<00:00:33.010> do<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.370> because

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
very important you do that because

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.460 
very important you do that because
otherwise<00:00:33.940> rising<00:00:34.480> damp<00:00:34.720> will<00:00:34.840> come<00:00:35.019> into<00:00:35.290> the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
as you can see the first thing to do

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.140 
as you can see the first thing to do
just<00:01:24.830> put<00:01:25.040> two<00:01:25.190> corners<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.730> drill<00:01:26.030> them

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
just put two corners and drill them

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.660 
just put two corners and drill them
together<00:01:26.560> now<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:27.770> always<00:01:27.920> best<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.370> drill

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
together now it's always best to drill

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.000 
together now it's always best to drill
and<00:01:28.850> screw<00:01:28.970> if<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:29.960> nail<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.500> doesn't<00:01:30.680> hold

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
and screw if you nail it it doesn't hold

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.520 
and screw if you nail it it doesn't hold
as<00:01:31.250> well<00:01:31.280> screwing<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.050> much<00:01:33.320> more

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
as well screwing is is a much more

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.700 
as well screwing is is a much more
permanent<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.100> tighter<00:01:34.910> fix<00:01:35.440> that's<00:01:36.440> coming

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
permanent and tighter fix that's coming

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.350 
permanent and tighter fix that's coming
with<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.890> sides<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:38.600> other<00:01:38.750> side<00:01:38.990> going<00:01:39.200> in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
noticed those screws are bright Singh

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.600 
noticed those screws are bright Singh
