a<00:01:27.360> little<00:01:27.390> extra<00:01:28.140> copper<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.570> I'm<00:01:30.570> going

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a little extra copper here and I'm going

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.480 
a little extra copper here and I'm going
to<00:01:30.900> trim<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.560> probably<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.250> tad

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to trim that it's probably just a tad

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
to trim that it's probably just a tad
more<00:01:32.520> than<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> quarter<00:01:33.479> inch<00:01:35.150> okay<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.360> trimmed

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
more than a quarter inch okay I trimmed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
more than a quarter inch okay I trimmed
that<00:01:37.159> when<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> lay<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.640> back<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.420> see

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that when I lay that back in you can see

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.649

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
end there's my core wing crimp then I'm

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630 
end there's my core wing crimp then I'm
going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> use<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.380> high<00:02:07.590> end<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
going to use the high end or the the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.390 
going to use the high end or the the
larger<00:02:09.450> end<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.869> crimp<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> insulation<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
larger end to crimp the insulation the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
larger end to crimp the insulation the
insulation<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.330> little

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
insulation is a little

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.110 
insulation is a little
our<00:02:13.290> diameter<00:02:13.620> than<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.129> core<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.939> will

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
our diameter than the core so that will

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.759 
our diameter than the core so that will
be<00:02:15.239> sufficient<00:02:15.510> enough<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.140> complete<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
be sufficient enough to complete the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.220 
be sufficient enough to complete the
crimp<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.900> go

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
crimp and there we go

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.809 
crimp and there we go
good<00:02:19.950> crimp<00:02:21.500> perfect<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.099> have<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> great<00:02:23.549> roll

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
good crimp perfect you have a great roll

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.449 
good crimp perfect you have a great roll
just<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.900> amount<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.290> wire<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.920> little

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
just the right amount of wire a little

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.530 
just the right amount of wire a little

around<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.959> insulation<00:02:31.500> wing<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.890> want<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.430> do

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
around the insulation wing I want to do

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.520 
around the insulation wing I want to do
one<00:02:32.730> other<00:02:32.909> one<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.480> let's<00:02:33.690> sue<00:02:33.930> let's

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
one other one for you let's sue let's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990 
one other one for you let's sue let's
take<00:02:34.739> what<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.069> would<00:02:35.220> have<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.579> headlight

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
take what we would have in the headlight

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.940 
take what we would have in the headlight
circuit<00:02:36.480> when<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.110> go<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.530> left<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.920> right

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
circuit when we go to the left or right

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.699 
circuit when we go to the left or right
hands<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.940> left<00:02:39.090> side<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.170> vehicle<00:02:40.560> in

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
hands the left side of the vehicle in

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.349 
hands the left side of the vehicle in
the<00:02:40.829> front<00:02:41.099> we<00:02:41.280> usually<00:02:41.670> double<00:02:42.120> up<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
the front we usually double up a

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.300 
the front we usually double up a
connection<00:02:42.629> for<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.500> high<00:02:43.650> end<00:02:43.680> low<00:02:43.980> beams

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
connection for the high end low beams

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.020 
connection for the high end low beams
they<00:02:44.939> are<00:02:45.180> 14<00:02:45.750> gauge<00:02:45.989> wires<00:02:46.349> again<00:02:46.879> doubled<00:02:47.879> up

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
they are 14 gauge wires again doubled up

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.229 
they are 14 gauge wires again doubled up
and<00:02:48.269> then<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:49.590> wire<00:02:49.769> comes<00:02:50.159> from<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> front

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
and then one wire comes from the front

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.360 
and then one wire comes from the front
bulkhead<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:52.049> other<00:02:52.319> actually<00:02:52.799> goes<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.069> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
bulkhead the other actually goes to the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.910 
bulkhead the other actually goes to the
other<00:02:53.489> side<00:02:53.690> headlight<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.139> how<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.709> deal

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
other side headlight so how do we deal

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.129 
other side headlight so how do we deal
with<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.250> termination<00:02:56.790> well<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.659> terminal

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
with this termination well the terminal

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.589 
with this termination well the terminal
we<00:02:58.230> use<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> little<00:02:59.549> wider<00:02:59.849> here<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
we use it's a little wider here in the

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.140 
we use it's a little wider here in the
blade<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.260> 59<00:03:01.590> series<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.940> also

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
blade it's a 59 series but it's also

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.970 
blade it's a 59 series but it's also
water<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> corn<00:03:04.049> insulation<00:03:04.620> wing<00:03:04.769> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
water in the corn insulation wing and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.460 
water in the corn insulation wing and
the<00:03:05.040> reason<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.579> it's<00:03:06.060> made<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the reason is it's made to do this

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.399 
the reason is it's made to do this
double<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.849> can<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.840> pre<00:03:10.079> stripped

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
double as you can see we pre stripped

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.949 
double as you can see we pre stripped
this<00:03:10.590> wire<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.159> it's<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.760> good<00:03:11.940> strip<00:03:12.359> it's<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
this wire and it's a good strip it's the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.930 
this wire and it's a good strip it's the
right<00:03:13.200> length<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.129> what<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.579> do<00:03:14.730> now

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
right length so what I'm going to do now

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.659 
right length so what I'm going to do now
is<00:03:15.209> use<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.720> double<00:03:16.109> tool<00:03:16.379> so<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.430> tool

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
is use the double tool so this tool

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.339 
is use the double tool so this tool
won't<00:03:17.879> be<00:03:18.060> applicable<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.720> will<00:03:18.900> use<00:03:19.139> the

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
won't be applicable I will use the

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.439 
won't be applicable I will use the
double<00:03:19.530> insulation<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.519> double<00:03:20.970> crimp<00:03:21.209> tool

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
double insulation a double crimp tool

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.000 
double insulation a double crimp tool
and<00:03:22.160> again<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:23.639> have<00:03:23.849> two<00:03:24.629> wings<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.560> smaller

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and again we have two wings the smaller

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.759 
and again we have two wings the smaller
wing<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:27.060> crimp<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.480> core<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.260> larger

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
wing here will crimp the core the larger

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.129 
wing here will crimp the core the larger
wing<00:03:29.010> will<00:03:29.430> crimp<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.120> insulation<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.989> I'll

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
wing will crimp the insulation and I'll

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.349 
wing will crimp the insulation and I'll
do<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> I've<00:03:33.239> taken<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.599> smaller<00:03:33.989> wing

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
do that so I've taken the smaller wing

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.430 
do that so I've taken the smaller wing
you<00:03:36.359> can<00:03:36.389> see<00:03:36.780> I'm<00:03:36.989> down<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:39.410> does<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
you can see I'm down on that and does a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.729 
you can see I'm down on that and does a
great<00:03:40.680> crimp<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.609> core<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:43.440> I'm<00:03:43.590> going

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
great crimp on the core then I'm going

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.650 
great crimp on the core then I'm going
to<00:03:43.799> flip<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.129> tool<00:03:44.340> over<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
to flip the tool over and do the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.720 
to flip the tool over and do the
insulation<00:03:45.959> wing<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.829> there's<00:03:50.310> your<00:03:50.489> crimp

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
insulation wing and there's your crimp

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.350 
insulation wing and there's your crimp
and<00:03:50.879> that's<00:03:51.870> that's<00:03:52.410> correct

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and that's that's correct

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.780 
and that's that's correct
going<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.540> point<00:03:54.750> out<00:03:55.130> what<00:03:56.130> happens<00:03:56.520> when<00:03:56.700> you

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
going to point out what happens when you

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.860 
going to point out what happens when you
get<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> bad<00:03:57.240> crimp<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.410> first<00:03:58.620> case

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
get a bad crimp in this first case

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.030 
get a bad crimp in this first case
somebody<00:04:00.870> forgot<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.110> strip<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> wire

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
somebody forgot to strip the wire

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.700 
somebody forgot to strip the wire
so<00:04:02.850> they've<00:04:03.270> crimped<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:03.930> looks<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.380> it's

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
so they've crimped it it looks like it's

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.220 
so they've crimped it it looks like it's
a<00:04:04.770> great<00:04:05.040> crimp<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:06.540> little<00:04:06.930> bit<00:04:07.050> of<00:04:07.140> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
a great crimp and a little bit of the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.230 
a great crimp and a little bit of the
insulation<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.980> sticking<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.490> on<00:04:08.730> top<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.150> this

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
insulation is sticking up on top of this

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.449 
insulation is sticking up on top of this
wire<00:04:12.020> less<00:04:13.020> if<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.590> did<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:15.030> look<00:04:16.100> but<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.250> can

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
wire less if I did this look but you can

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.420 
wire less if I did this look but you can
see<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:20.250> there's<00:04:20.519> no<00:04:21.920> contact<00:04:22.920> between<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
see that there's no contact between the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640 
see that there's no contact between the
terminal<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.000> copper<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.630> wire<00:04:24.810> there

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
terminal and the copper the wire there

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.200 
terminal and the copper the wire there
would<00:04:25.830> not<00:04:25.980> be<00:04:26.040> conductivity<00:04:26.700> on<00:04:27.030> this

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
would not be conductivity on this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.900 
would not be conductivity on this
terminal<00:04:27.530> second<00:04:28.530> one<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.950> looks<00:04:32.669> like<00:04:32.850> a

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
terminal second one this looks like a

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.180 
terminal second one this looks like a
good<00:04:33.180> crimp<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.990> problem<00:04:34.380> here<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.800> not

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
good crimp the problem here is that not

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.820 
good crimp the problem here is that not
enough<00:04:35.400> wire<00:04:35.880> was<00:04:36.240> stripped<00:04:36.630> so<00:04:37.290> there's<00:04:37.530> very

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
enough wire was stripped so there's very

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.580 
enough wire was stripped so there's very
little<00:04:38.250> copper<00:04:38.880> that's<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.690> inside<00:04:39.930> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
little copper that's actually inside the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.740 
little copper that's actually inside the
core<00:04:40.890> wing<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.430> we<00:04:41.970> can<00:04:42.150> tell<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.390> why

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
core wing and we can tell that why

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.740 
core wing and we can tell that why
because<00:04:43.200> there's<00:04:43.440> no<00:04:43.710> there's<00:04:44.520> no<00:04:44.690> view<00:04:45.690> of

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
because there's no there's no view of

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.409 
because there's no there's no view of
the<00:04:46.050> copper<00:04:46.590> or<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.100> littlest<00:04:47.820> bit<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.090> copper

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
the copper or the littlest bit of copper

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.140 
the copper or the littlest bit of copper
off<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.840> top<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.350> core<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.550> core<00:04:50.970> wing

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
off the top of the core of the core wing

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.250 
off the top of the core of the core wing
crimp<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.430> just<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.850> opposite<00:04:54.419> too<00:04:54.960> much

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
crimp this is just the opposite too much

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.150 
crimp this is just the opposite too much
strip<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:56.610> would<00:04:56.850> work

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
strip this would work

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.490 
strip this would work
however<00:04:59.360> right<00:05:00.360> here<00:05:00.720> is<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.080> end<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.410> the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
however right here is the end of the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.350 
however right here is the end of the
insulation<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.520> off<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.790> end<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.270> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
insulation it is off the end of the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360 
insulation it is off the end of the
insulation<00:05:03.810> crimp<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.770> remember<00:05:05.070> we<00:05:05.190> said

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
insulation crimp so you remember we said

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.430 
insulation crimp so you remember we said
before<00:05:05.729> about<00:05:05.760> fulcrum<00:05:06.450> look<00:05:07.110> at<00:05:07.229> where<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
before about fulcrum look at where the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.050 
before about fulcrum look at where the
fulcrum<00:05:07.800> is<00:05:07.950> right<00:05:08.160> now<00:05:09.410> you<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:10.590> see<00:05:11.060> it's

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
fulcrum is right now you can see it's

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.580 
fulcrum is right now you can see it's
not<00:05:12.240> going<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.450> be<00:05:12.540> too<00:05:12.720> long<00:05:12.960> if<00:05:13.260> there<00:05:13.470> was

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
not going to be too long if there was

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.500 
not going to be too long if there was
vibration<00:05:14.190> involved<00:05:14.550> with<00:05:14.669> this<00:05:14.820> this<00:05:15.210> wire

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
vibration involved with this this wire

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:25.239 
vibration involved with this this wire
would<00:05:15.780> weaken<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.260> snap<00:05:16.560> at<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:16.919> point

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:25.249
