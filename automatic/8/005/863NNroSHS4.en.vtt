00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
kind of realized that maybe we took it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
kind of realized that maybe we took it
too<00:01:39.270> far<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.960> trying<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> changing<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
too far with trying to changing up the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.330 
too far with trying to changing up the
sound<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.750> still<00:01:42.930> love<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.350> record<00:01:43.799> and

sound but we still love that record and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.569 
sound but we still love that record and
we<00:01:44.700> learned<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.329> our<00:01:45.600> our<00:01:46.340> craft<00:01:47.340> of
