00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
want to follow the same end but i also

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260

think<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.619> useful<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.790> thought<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
think they can be useful so I thought I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
think they can be useful so I thought I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.429 
might write one for the daily english'
of<00:01:38.640> course<00:01:38.970> they<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> general<00:01:39.990> idea<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of course they have a general idea of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.010
