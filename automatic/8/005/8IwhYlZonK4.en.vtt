00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.129
 if you want to capture areas or regions 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 complete of a website or a 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.750
 specific screens the only thing that 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.450
 you need to add is screen capture of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 google to your chrome browser this is a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.749
 of better applications to create 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.289
 files of images captured in 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.480
 format that you want to save jpg or png to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.090
 then publish it or share it through 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 from the web the best this is an extension 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.050
 free for google chrome let's see 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.419
 then the configuration and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.600
 activation on google chrome we are going to 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.780
 one to a specific page and we choose 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 an area that we are going to capture we are going to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.220
 take this area in this case has already been 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 installed from that activation process 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.030
 we will see it at the end then in the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.310
 top right we go to the areas 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 to the extensions area and there then 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.280
 we search is screen capture we click and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 four options appear to capture one 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 region of the region of a page 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.830
 capture the visible content captures the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 full page or a region of the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.990
 screen in the options section 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.690
 then we can see that they have 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.830
 three specific areas 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.540
 initial which is for example the format 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.640
 let's say if we can choose in png format 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.550
 or jpg 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 let's say that these formats already have to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.630
 see as with loss let's say the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.660
 quality but fundamentally the best 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 is the PNG in the next section is 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.910
 the area or the exact place where it goes is going 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.720
 store the catches here for example 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.150
 is the exact route I can choose 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 some other route if I want to change the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.600
 location of the file will be left 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.850
 stored there is a box of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 verification does not allow us to save 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.520
 once the capture is done this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.200
 it depends then that is already let's say the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 decision of each one of us as what 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.060
 we feel better with subjects catches and there 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 a short cut or shortcuts that allow 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.860
 simply with a quick aesthetic is 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.950
 a combination of hiv control or for 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 to be able to choose the format in which we are going 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.680
 to do it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.149
 once this is defined then 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.070
 we apply or click on the option to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 close and store then we go to 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.180
 proceed to make a capture 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.520
 but fast let's choose for example 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.280
 capture a region 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.500
 this automatically shows us a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.430
 small window with a size let's say 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.790
 2 50% 50 pixels set we can 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.950
 use the lower right corner to 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 drag it and once we define 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.850
 the size in which or the area 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.580
 specific the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.100
 click ok or just cancel the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.890
 click on ok automatically it 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.690
 generates the capture and from here then 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.210
 we have some option how to highlight 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.220
 write and we can even create some 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.890
 choose some images if we want 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.500
 I had to do some retouching in the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.570
 image or highlight a specific area and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.730
 from here are the options to save 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.160
 share and close I can from here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.080
 even make a copy or print it 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.850
 I can close I can share 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.950
 directly say send this image 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.350
 captured to picasa to facebook or other 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.270
 networks that we have there available or 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.550
 I can tell you once and save and 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.160
 we know that the route is the desk 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.660
 so I just give it to him we have a 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.640
 first name 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.400
 a specific name for the capture and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.410
 Save the image has already been saved 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.080
 I can then from here already simply 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.180
 delete it let's go to the desktop and 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.790
 we note that here is the main image 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.290
 and we can even observe it 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.570
 We can say that we planned 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.390
 the preview and here is the image 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.150
 as such very well 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.580
 in this way then the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.800
 capture made and what we can do 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.160
 then then it's 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.900
 activating deactivation is very simple 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.670
 let's say the final part where we 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.310
 all we have to do is go one 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.390
 times if we are here in our 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.040
 favorites are the most websites 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.880
 visited chrome what we should do 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.800
 is to go to the web store remember this 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.320
 utility or this extension only 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.310
 apply for google chrome we click on 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:15.350
 the icon of the apps store and in 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.480
 the bus area that we wrote screen 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.820
 capture by google automatically 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.430
 let's say in the second option or list 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.750
 appears in the second position appears 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.930
 the extent that we are 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.600
 looking then see that here the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.670
 it does not show it anymore and from here then 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.110
 because he appears with this green color 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.880
 because it has already been installed already 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.200
 we have installed the process of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.940
 installation that you would do is very 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.190
 simple simply click on 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.320
 add chrome starts a very process 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.110
 fast installation and automatically 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.670
 can already once it is already installed can 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.010
 pre visualize from here and start 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.780
 let's say to be used by part of 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.760
 we hope this video is from 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.940
 very useful for all of you up to 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.940
 soon
