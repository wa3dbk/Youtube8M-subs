00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello sons of bitches today is your lucky day 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.070
 Well yes today it reveals to you that one of the greatest secrets must run and 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.690
 be 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.029
 one of the mysteries most sought by the chinacos 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.029
 yes the men who own a Chinese moped 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.659
 we started changing the carburetor splash 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.839
 this modification is basic and elementary always required to win 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.999
 many horsepower 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.499
 a good high flow air filter 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.269
 preferably a crime for people to realize that we could pay 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.389
 600 pesos for an air filter that is not worth a hundred 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.130
 to have strength and a lot of speed we will also add the famous cables 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.890
 of spark plug I did not do not worry when it comes to draw 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 since what matters is that you see the little letters 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.040
 with this you already have an engine of biblical proportions and a power 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.860
 creepy that would leave pendejo up to Fernando Alonso in his formula 1 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.729
 Of course 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.869
 such a bastard engine requires a more cabrona transmission 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.590
 that's why we will have to remove the rollers from the inverter and change the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.310
 clutch springs for a few more tourist 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.390
 if you do not find any or share Kirby's secret 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.540
 4931 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.650
 go to your bed and remove that spring that has been fucking the balls 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.180
 every night now with this you will get two new things 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 a competitive clutch and a more comfortable bed 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.370
 with this we will gain a lot of acceptance 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.370
 although of course, with this we will lose only a few kilometers of 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.590
 peak speed but what will still be more than you had before 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 we already have a good admission and a better transmission 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.530
 but we need a good escape outlet 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.700
 then don and the steps to follow my beloved Las Tunas 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.440
 go to the bento warehouse that is for bullfighting 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 Ask them to give them one of the leaks that are usually thrown away 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.150
 we return to your houses jumping with joy and applauding 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.840
 very carefully not to be with the escape in the face or in the balls 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.660
 next step 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.230
 bring the mentioned one with a mosquito net to trim you are 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.020
 there luck to the taste while more turns it sees more interesting to him it will be seen 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.890
 let's make it seem like doing more of what it really does as something more 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.890
 important and will give you more power according to bento reiser 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.739
 go home jumping for joy and applause and cough 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.159
 place the tube in the proper position 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.639
 always observing that the board is well placed 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.069
 the following are optional modifications 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.559
 as additional poor install speakers and an mp3 player of those that 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.699
 they look aliquot but cheaper 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.789
 an amplifier and a 12-inch cutter 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:43.499
 also many pics to make the bike look more futuristic and therefore 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.509
 it seems to be faster 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.479
 with this they will not run anymore but people look at them with envy in their colony and the 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.709
 people will think that their squire is worth more than what is really worth 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.499
 with this surely your motorcycle will be like a plane and will increase wildly 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.209
 its speed 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.999
 Any questions or questions about these procedures ask Bento 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.979
 ritcher in the moto latino forum 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.749
 just be careful because you can confuse your historical with a ducati 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.479
 with that in electra they say they are Italian and l'esquerra to sell pure 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.630
 good pinasco parts culeros 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.749
 after such a good recipe I can only ask 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.859
 something happens if I fall and took a helmet 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.279
 good bastards 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.079
 now I can go out to the streets of your city kitchen and run against 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.619
 imaginary motorcycles 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:28.409
 until next time
