morning was a bit different because we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
morning was a bit different because we
were<00:00:37.469> expecting<00:00:37.980> rain<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.120> opened<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
were expecting rain we just opened the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
were expecting rain we just opened the
curtain<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> hotel<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.250> saw<00:00:41.399> no<00:00:41.850> rain

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
curtain in the hotel and we saw no rain

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.850 
curtain in the hotel and we saw no rain
okay<00:00:42.450> you're<00:00:43.079> gonna<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
okay you're gonna go for it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160 
okay you're gonna go for it
the<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:45.059> patched<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> track<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.930> some

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the they patched the track with some

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.090 
the they patched the track with some
white<00:00:46.980> clay<00:00:47.510> udders<00:00:48.510> those<00:00:49.440> portions<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
white clay udders those portions on the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
white clay udders those portions on the
track<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> track<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.180> slippery<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
track the track was really slippery so I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.709 
track the track was really slippery so I
think<00:00:52.199> being<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> group<00:00:53.280> run<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.480> maybe

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
think being in group run was not maybe

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.630 
think being in group run was not maybe
the<00:00:54.899> best<00:00:55.079> after<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.190> those<00:00:56.340> sections

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the best after I think in those sections

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490 
the best after I think in those sections
the<00:00:56.969> track<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.390> faster<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.140> why<00:00:58.289> some

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the track was faster so that's why some

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.150 
the track was faster so that's why some
guys<00:00:58.680> were<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.550> least<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.030> fast<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.420> us<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
guys were at least as fast as us and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
guys were at least as fast as us and
that's<00:01:02.160> why<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:03.140> think<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.379> group<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.830> could

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that's why I think the group one could

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.330 
that's why I think the group one could
be<00:01:05.189> faster<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> next<00:01:06.090> round<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.070> run

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
be faster in the next round and you run

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
be faster in the next round and you run
you<00:01:08.640> mentioned<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> us<00:01:09.420> before<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> had

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you mentioned to us before that you had

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
you mentioned to us before that you had
I<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:10.830> bad<00:01:11.010> laps<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> middle<00:01:11.850> or

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I think two bad laps in the middle or

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
I think two bad laps in the middle or
something<00:01:12.299> yeah<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.680> inserts<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
something yeah I think my my inserts in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
something yeah I think my my inserts in
my<00:01:14.580> tires<00:01:14.850> became<00:01:15.420> warmer<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:16.680> why<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
my tires became warmer that's why the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
my tires became warmer that's why the
track<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> car<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.390> unstable<00:01:18.689> but

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
track the car was really unstable but

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
track the car was really unstable but
after<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> couple<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> laps<00:01:20.189> he<00:01:20.580> came<00:01:20.939> back

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
after a couple of laps he came back

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.380 
after a couple of laps he came back
together<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.049> keep<00:01:22.290> pushing<00:01:22.500> till<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> end

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
together and I keep pushing till the end

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.289 
together and I keep pushing till the end
