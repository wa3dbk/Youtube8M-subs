00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 very good to all of you today I am going to have a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.490
 video of how to connect playstation 4 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.130
 to the internet and the first thing that you have the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.290
 console and you do not know how we're going to go to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.700
 settings as you can see here 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.700
 we go to network 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.770
 we have the option to connect to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 internet for this we have to have it 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.300
 put if we want to connect to the internet and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 let's configure our connection 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 internet we can do in two ways or 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 either by wireless or wired them 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 I recommend by cable if they did not 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 your house by cable 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.750
 then by wifi we will get nothing 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.350
 ok is the wifi let's start with 40 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.080
 we have easy face- to- face options if 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 you do not want to complicate life much 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.489
 make it easy and if we can not it is also 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.620
 quote a little more about the topic 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.770
 customized 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 We will use the customized voucher 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.840
 we select the one we want 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.420
 connect us here will give us several 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 options we will connect with this that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.770
 there is the law 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 once we put the key we give 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 to accept 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.790
 is configuring on the internet now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 same is waiting and pi pi pi pi 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 wait I do not know how long it will take about ten 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.310
 twenty seconds we have here good 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.190
 but we can select different 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.820
 flu type adjustments you can put it 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.400
 automatic manual or this last option 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.900
 I recommend it automatically we put 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 automatic 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.020
 names of two do not specify fit 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.609
 you have automatic 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.380
 automatic mtb setting that is, but if 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.420
 do not use 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.120
 and configuration has already been updated 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.930
 let's try the internet connection 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.930
 we tested it 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.200
 no type 2 gives us the speed 18 with 2 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.209
 megas and 4 with four uploads currently 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.250
 we have 100 less and now we will see when 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.200
 we know it by cable we will see that the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.520
 speed is almost an almost equal 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.980
 that in wifi and that why because they are 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.850
 Estimated speeds in the console are not 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.230
 tells you the real speed 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.250
 in whistling we have to have 100 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 megas or more even like the 200 but the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.120
 maximum speed that will go more or less 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.670
 to capture is going to be this 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.459
 we have already configured the connection 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.170
 wifi we will configure the connection by 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.180
 cable use the white 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.760
 easy or customized we are going to 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.599
 select custom 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.370
 automatic pp address this is not 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:11.970
 specify is automatic automatic 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.360
 do not use proxy and we're going to try the 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.360
 collection 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.670
 for this we have to have connected a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.120
 fine cable directly from the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.120
 console 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.530
 to the router or from here we have gijÃ³n to 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:35.760
 3 download speed 17 with 3 and 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.450
 upload connection 5 with 4 these are 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.450
 approximate values 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.130
 and this all here we can see we can 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.840
 internet connection if we want can 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.930
 do the little this we have done 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.930
 now 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.560
 internet connection test we are going to 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.560
 form again 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.900
 realized made 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.190
 and put checking type 2 because before 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.600
 it seemed type 3 and now type 2 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.049
 practically then in a failure of 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.000
 phillips or 4 because I have it currently 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.950
 directly connected the router all 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.070
 the ports open and he puts me type 2 in 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.780
 playstation 3 they put type 1 I do not know by 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.120
 what now in playstation 4 by in type 2 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.190
 it's very weird and wifi also puts me on 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.110
 guy obviously if you have all the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.990
 open ports you'll have type 2 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.139
 only if they have a cable connection 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.700
 it would have to be type 1 but equipment is 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.310
 the same will play exactly what 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.740
 same the one of the guy believes there's only 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.570
 three type the 1 the 2 and the 3 when not 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.669
 you have the ports winds and the snap 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.590
 would be strict then for games 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.620
 it's going to be more complicated to find 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.970
 departure if you have the type 3 good 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.060
 I will leave you guys a 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.900
 link in this video how to do 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.240
 a cable connection in 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.419
 different rooms without pulling any 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.790
 cable through is very easy and nothing 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.090
 see you next video until the 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.090
 next
