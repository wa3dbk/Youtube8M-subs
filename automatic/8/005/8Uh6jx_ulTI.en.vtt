00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
batteries to go through the controller

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.770 
batteries to go through the controller
to<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.560> motor<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:37.180> gearbox

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to the motor and this is the gearbox

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.930 
to the motor and this is the gearbox
that<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:39.370> transfers<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:42.430> motor<00:02:42.730> rpms<00:02:43.709> to

that then transfers the motor rpms to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.250 
that then transfers the motor rpms to
the<00:02:45.940> dr<00:02:46.380> dragging<00:02:47.380> wheels<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.640> batteries<00:02:49.260> are

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
the dr dragging wheels the batteries are

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.830 
the dr dragging wheels the batteries are
located<00:02:50.950> under<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.430> center<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.299> vehicle

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
located under the center of the vehicle

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
located under the center of the vehicle
and<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:53.830> completely<00:02:54.340> enclosed<00:02:55.330> container

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
and then completely enclosed container

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.050 
and then completely enclosed container
so<00:02:57.930> both<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.110> driver<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:01.079> occupants<00:03:02.079> are

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
so both the driver and the occupants are

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.400 
so both the driver and the occupants are
separate<00:03:04.060> from<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.390> batteries<00:03:04.870> yet<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
separate from the batteries yet the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.729 
separate from the batteries yet the
batteries<00:03:05.890> are<00:03:06.070> completely<00:03:06.700> enclosed<00:03:07.739> they

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
batteries are completely enclosed they

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.890 
batteries are completely enclosed they
are<00:03:08.950> also<00:03:09.190> located<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> center<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
are also located in the center of the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.729 
are also located in the center of the
vehicle<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.790> optimal<00:03:13.739> driving

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
vehicle so you have optimal driving

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.220 
vehicle so you have optimal driving
conditions<00:03:15.280> an<00:03:15.549> optimum<00:03:16.150> center<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.660> gravity

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
conditions an optimum center of gravity
