00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
now this just super-powered being it's

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.270 
now this just super-powered being it's
awesome<00:06:55.560> it's<00:06:55.740> pretty<00:06:55.980> cool<00:06:56.190> stuff<00:06:56.520> and<00:06:58.280> that

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
awesome it's pretty cool stuff and that

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.720 
awesome it's pretty cool stuff and that
you're<00:07:00.030> the<00:07:00.420> first<00:07:00.660> arc<00:07:01.050> was<00:07:01.710> art<00:07:02.100> by<00:07:02.460> John

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
you're the first arc was art by John

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.910 
you're the first arc was art by John
Cassaday<00:07:03.300> and<00:07:03.510> John<00:07:03.960> Cassidy's<00:07:04.500> art<00:07:04.740> is

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
Cassaday and John Cassidy's art is

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.080 
Cassaday and John Cassidy's art is
really<00:07:04.950> good

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
really good

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.600 
really good
the<00:07:06.600> problem<00:07:07.080> is<00:07:07.260> Cassidy<00:07:07.890> can't<00:07:08.220> keep<00:07:08.400> up

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
the problem is Cassidy can't keep up

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.840 
the problem is Cassidy can't keep up
with<00:07:08.760> a<00:07:08.790> consistent<00:07:09.450> schedule<00:07:09.720> and

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
with a consistent schedule and

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.650 
with a consistent schedule and
eventually<00:07:11.850> he<00:07:12.150> got<00:07:12.390> the<00:07:13.380> boot<00:07:13.590> so<00:07:14.660> they

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
eventually he got the boot so they

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.850 
eventually he got the boot so they
replaced<00:07:16.020> him<00:07:16.140> with<00:07:16.200> a<00:07:16.380> more<00:07:16.560> consistent

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
replaced him with a more consistent

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.940 
replaced him with a more consistent
artist<00:07:17.400> and<00:07:17.580> I<00:07:18.090> think<00:07:18.810> this<00:07:19.380> is<00:07:19.530> one<00:07:19.740> of<00:07:19.830> the

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
artist and I think this is one of the

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.680 
artist and I think this is one of the
better<00:07:20.190> runs<00:07:20.750> of<00:07:21.750> the<00:07:22.350> series<00:07:22.740> so<00:07:23.670> we<00:07:24.030> we<00:07:24.510> get

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
better runs of the series so we we get

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.870 
better runs of the series so we we get
here<00:07:24.960> is<00:07:25.200> you<00:07:25.800> know<00:07:25.920> Resco<00:07:26.310> coming<00:07:26.610> to<00:07:26.730> power
