00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
actually dig out where the I was that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.460 
actually dig out where the I was that
fight<00:01:07.530> along<00:01:07.890> otherwise<00:01:08.130> they'll<00:01:08.400> grow<00:01:08.610> back

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so that's the first thing so you just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.020 
so that's the first thing so you just
leave<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> sprouts<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.780> potato<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> that's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
leave to sprouts on one potato so that's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
leave to sprouts on one potato so that's
me<00:01:15.210> whoops<00:01:15.659> sort<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.170> next

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
me whoops sort it out and then the next

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:33.330 
me whoops sort it out and then the next
thing<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.130> do

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.830 

so<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.460> about<00:01:34.610> what<00:01:34.940> for<00:01:35.270> probably

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
so it's about what for probably

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.820 
so it's about what for probably
something<00:01:36.140> like<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:40.180> what<00:01:41.180> I've<00:01:41.240> got<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.830> got

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
something like that what I've got is got

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.260 
something like that what I've got is got
some<00:01:42.980> fertilizer<00:01:43.430> now<00:01:43.670> I'm<00:01:43.760> gonna<00:01:43.850> put<00:01:44.060> 2
