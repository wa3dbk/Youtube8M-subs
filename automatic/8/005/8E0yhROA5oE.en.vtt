you<00:03:37.540> probably<00:03:38.139> figure<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.739> if<00:03:38.859> you've

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
you probably figure that out if you've

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.289 
you probably figure that out if you've
been<00:03:39.160> following<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.669> series<00:03:39.880> for<00:03:40.180> awhile

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
been following the series for awhile

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.620 
been following the series for awhile
you'll<00:03:40.569> figure<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:41.019> out<00:03:41.200> but<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.630> haven't

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
you'll figure that out but I haven't

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.180 
you'll figure that out but I haven't
mentioned<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:44.049> in<00:03:44.230> any<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.470> my<00:03:44.620> videos<00:03:44.650> I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
mentioned this in any of my videos I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.300 
mentioned this in any of my videos I
don't<00:03:45.250> think<00:03:45.579> not<00:03:46.510> only<00:03:46.569> what<00:03:47.049> state<00:03:47.440> but<00:03:47.980> what

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
don't think not only what state but what

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.190 
don't think not only what state but what
city<00:03:48.910> do<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.599> think<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:49.989> moved<00:03:50.200> here<00:03:50.560> from<00:03:51.150> okay

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
now probably nobody's going to get it

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.860 
now probably nobody's going to get it
but<00:03:58.299> what<00:03:58.569> I'll<00:03:58.720> do<00:03:58.959> is<00:04:00.359> once<00:04:01.359> all<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.720> answers

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
but what I'll do is once all the answers

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.220 
but what I'll do is once all the answers
are<00:04:02.319> in<00:04:02.459> once<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.639> close<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.150> competition<00:04:04.870> I'll
