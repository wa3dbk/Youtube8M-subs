what<00:00:00.329> you'd<00:00:00.570> love<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.900> disorient<00:00:01.680> or<00:00:02.190> when

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
what you'd love to disorient or when

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.900 
what you'd love to disorient or when
audiences<00:00:04.069> well<00:00:05.779> I<00:00:06.779> think<00:00:07.429> my<00:00:08.429> theory<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.880> uh

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
audiences well I think my theory is uh

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.780 
audiences well I think my theory is uh
this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.320> isn't<00:00:10.620> really<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:11.550> kind<00:00:11.759> of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
this is this isn't really it's kind of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.490 
this is this isn't really it's kind of
dumb<00:00:12.000> but<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> analogy<00:00:13.880> essentially

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
dumb but I like the analogy essentially

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.140 
dumb but I like the analogy essentially
the<00:00:16.500> idea<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:18.320> like<00:00:19.850> destabilization<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the idea of I like destabilization and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.750 
the idea of I like destabilization and
one<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> designs<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> European

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
one of the designs for the European

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.920 
one of the designs for the European
Joint<00:00:24.060> Strike<00:00:24.300> Fighter<00:00:25.340> project<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:27.510> which

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
Joint Strike Fighter project and which

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
Joint Strike Fighter project and which
was<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.550> all<00:00:29.730> these<00:00:29.820> people<00:00:30.090> through

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
was you know all these people through

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.999 
was you know all these people through
these<00:00:30.840> designs<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.710> Northrop

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
these designs I can get at Northrop

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.359 
these designs I can get at Northrop

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
Grumman

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.770 
Grumman
like<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.090> these<00:00:33.210> companies<00:00:33.510> were

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
like all these all these companies were

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
like all these all these companies were
like<00:00:33.930> yeah<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.230> design<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.739> stealth

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
like yeah we can design your stealth

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.870 
like yeah we can design your stealth
fighter

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
fighter

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
fighter
whatever<00:00:36.450> attack<00:00:36.809> fighter<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.440> future

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
whatever attack fighter for the future

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.229 
whatever attack fighter for the future
and<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> designs<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.090> thought

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and one of the designs which I thought

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.180 
and one of the designs which I thought
was<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.570> beautiful<00:00:40.190> was<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.460> plane<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
was really beautiful was a plane that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.299 
was really beautiful was a plane that
was<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.239> posed<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> stable<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.860> flight

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
was it was posed in a stable in flight

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
was it was posed in a stable in flight
or<00:00:48.120> unstable<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.870> flight<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:50.879> took<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
or unstable in flight and it took a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.240 
or unstable in flight and it took a
series<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.670> computers<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.239> able<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
series of computers to be able to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
series of computers to be able to
control<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> control<00:00:57.390> services<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> all

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
control the the control services and all

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.869 
control the the control services and all
the<00:00:58.410> propulsion<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.100> forth<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.430> order<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> keep

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the propulsion so forth in order to keep

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.139 
the propulsion so forth in order to keep
it<00:01:00.059> stable<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.230> idea<00:01:01.710> being<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> it's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it stable the idea being that it's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
it stable the idea being that it's
unstable<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.110> give<00:01:04.320> any<00:01:04.589> loss<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.040> power<00:01:05.220> any

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
unstable so give any loss of power any

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969 
unstable so give any loss of power any
variation<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.299> control<00:01:06.780> creates<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.590> chaotic

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
variation in control creates a chaotic

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.670 
variation in control creates a chaotic
but<00:01:08.580> hyper<00:01:08.850> control<00:01:09.330> response<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> idea

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
but hyper control response so the idea

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
but hyper control response so the idea
being<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.720> Jets

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
being that if they want to do the Jets

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.899 
being that if they want to do the Jets
spin<00:01:13.380> around<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.280> unconventional

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
spin around in a really unconventional

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
spin around in a really unconventional
tangle<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:16.979> regain<00:01:17.369> control

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
tangle and then we take regain control

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.289 
tangle and then we take regain control
again

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
again

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.850 
again
so<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> instability<00:01:19.200> actually<00:01:19.500> becomes<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so the instability actually becomes a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.640 
so the instability actually becomes a
strength<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
strength so what I like about that is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.520 
strength so what I like about that is
that<00:01:22.860> when<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.610> audiences<00:01:24.350> destabilize<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that when an audiences destabilize the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.560 
that when an audiences destabilize the
expectation<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.220> subvert<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.820> destabilized

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
expectation of subvert is destabilized

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
expectation of subvert is destabilized
it<00:01:27.780> means<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.049> they're<00:01:28.170> more<00:01:28.290> agile<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:29.430> any

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it means that they're more agile for any

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.600 
it means that they're more agile for any
kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.540> randomized<00:01:31.079> idea

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
kind of randomized idea

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.950 
kind of randomized idea
because<00:01:31.790> eventually<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.360> audience<00:01:32.690> just<00:01:32.780> has

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
because eventually the audience just has

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.480 
because eventually the audience just has
to<00:01:33.080> give<00:01:33.260> up<00:01:35.170> yeah<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.620> not<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:36.890> I'm<00:01:37.220> so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
to give up yeah it's not like I'm so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.160 
to give up yeah it's not like I'm so
proud<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.030> can<00:01:38.210> make<00:01:38.540> an<00:01:38.660> audience<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.080> it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
proud of it I can make an audience do it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.360 
proud of it I can make an audience do it
it's<00:01:39.290> not<00:01:39.380> really<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.710> it's<00:01:40.160> just

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
it's not really that it's just

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.340 
it's not really that it's just
constantly<00:01:41.300> changing<00:01:42.280> direction<00:01:44.260> kind<00:01:45.260> of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
constantly changing direction kind of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.680 
constantly changing direction kind of
creates<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.180> moment<00:01:47.570> where

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
creates this this this moment where

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.170 
creates this this this moment where
someone's<00:01:48.080> like<00:01:48.140> well<00:01:48.410> I<00:01:48.740> mean<00:01:48.860> they're<00:01:49.010> gonna

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
someone's like well I mean they're gonna

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.380 
someone's like well I mean they're gonna
try<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.240> keep<00:01:50.479> guessing<00:01:50.780> which<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:51.650> fun<00:01:51.910> or<00:01:52.910> I'm

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
try to keep guessing which is fun or I'm

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.969 
try to keep guessing which is fun or I'm
just<00:01:53.540> going<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.720> go<00:01:53.840> along<00:01:53.960> for<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.380> ride<00:01:54.560> and

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
just going to go along for the ride and

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.740 
just going to go along for the ride and
see<00:01:55.160> where<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.400> takes<00:01:55.430> me<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.390> kind<00:01:56.720> of

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
see where it takes me so it kind of

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.100 
see where it takes me so it kind of
unifies<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.280> audience<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:58.850> ways<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.479> kind

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
unifies the audience in a ways that kind

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.540 
unifies the audience in a ways that kind
of<00:02:00.200> get<00:02:00.350> up<00:02:00.500> were<00:02:00.680> Detroit<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.550> an<00:02:01.970> experience
