what<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.420> the<00:00:03.570> most<00:00:03.719> sensible<00:00:04.230> approach<00:00:04.470> to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
what is the most sensible approach to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.000 
what is the most sensible approach to
dealing<00:00:05.340> with<00:00:05.520> accounts<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.630> cystitis<00:00:07.010> well

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
dealing with accounts with cystitis well

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.400 
dealing with accounts with cystitis well
the<00:00:08.099> first<00:00:08.370> decision<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.690> obstructed

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
the first decision is is it obstructed

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.740 
the first decision is is it obstructed
or<00:00:10.560> not<00:00:10.710> because<00:00:11.400> if<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.730> obstructed<00:00:12.330> think

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
or not because if it is obstructed think

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.930 
or not because if it is obstructed think
clearly<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:14.250> cat<00:00:14.400> has<00:00:14.550> got<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.820> be

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
clearly that the cat has got to be

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.700 
clearly that the cat has got to be
unobstructed<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:16.019> to<00:00:16.080> be<00:00:16.170> able<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.349> pass<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
unobstructed got to be able to pass the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.829 
unobstructed got to be able to pass the
catheter<00:00:17.119> clear<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> debris<00:00:18.480> etc<00:00:19.230> etc<00:00:20.839> you

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:24.659 
more about that but really it's a case

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.159 
more about that but really it's a case
of<00:00:24.769> ruling<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.919> stones<00:00:26.609> etc<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.630> remember

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
of ruling out stones etc but remember

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.489 
of ruling out stones etc but remember
that<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.769> 90%<00:00:29.489> of<00:00:29.939> obstructed<00:00:30.689> cats<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.199> is

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
that over 90% of obstructed cats it is

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.319 
that over 90% of obstructed cats it is
actually<00:00:32.040> stress<00:00:32.310> bladder<00:00:32.579> that's<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
actually stress bladder that's the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.290 
actually stress bladder that's the
underlying<00:00:33.660> problem<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.470> going<00:00:34.769> to<00:00:34.949> be

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
underlying problem it's going to be

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.439 
underlying problem it's going to be
spasm<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.449> urethra<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.850> urethral<00:00:38.850> sludge

urethral clogs so please if you remember
one<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.429> video

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
one thing only from this little video

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.819 
one thing only from this little video
remember<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.809> rectal<00:00:46.199> exams<00:00:46.559> on

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
remember to do rectal exams on

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.310

anesthetized<00:00:47.579> cats<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.629> obstructed

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
anesthetized cats that are obstructed

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.259 
anesthetized cats that are obstructed
because<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.859> is<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> best<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.789> actually

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
because that is the best way of actually

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.669 
because that is the best way of actually
finding<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.629> what's<00:00:51.780> happening<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679 
finding out what's happening in them and

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.250 
finding out what's happening in them and
whether<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> stone<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.269> so<00:00:55.050> if

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
whether it's a stone or not so if

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
whether it's a stone or not so if
they're<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.739> blocked<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:57.359> which<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.749> do

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
they're not blocked then which way do

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
they're not blocked then which way do
you<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:57.960> well<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.769> their<00:00:58.949> age<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you go well it's their age that's the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
you go well it's their age that's the
most<00:00:59.910> helpful<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.800> older<00:01:02.370> than

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
most helpful if they are older than

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.570 
most helpful if they are older than
about<00:01:02.940> 10<00:01:03.210> years<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> age<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.559> remember<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
about 10 years of age then remember a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
about 10 years of age then remember a
urine<00:01:06.060> tract<00:01:06.330> infection<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:06.930> more

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
urine tract infection is much more

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.220 
urine tract infection is much more
likely<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.860> stress<00:01:08.220> bladder<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> less<00:01:09.720> likely

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
likely and stress bladder is less likely

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.640 
likely and stress bladder is less likely
so<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.370> a<00:01:11.580> cat<00:01:11.790> presents<00:01:12.300> older<00:01:12.720> than<00:01:12.870> 10<00:01:13.110> with

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
so if a cat presents older than 10 with

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.500 
so if a cat presents older than 10 with
signs<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> recurrent<00:01:14.370> cystitis<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.270> honest

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
signs of recurrent cystitis to be honest

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.140 
signs of recurrent cystitis to be honest
it<00:01:15.600> Justin's<00:01:16.020> first<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.800> cystitis<00:01:17.190> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it Justin's first time cystitis you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
it Justin's first time cystitis you
really<00:01:18.480> need<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> culture<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.620> urine<00:01:19.920> check

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
really need to culture the urine check

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.150 
really need to culture the urine check
Bloods<00:01:20.940> look<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.810> diabetes<00:01:22.410> look<00:01:22.980> for

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
Bloods look for diabetes look for

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.590 
Bloods look for diabetes look for
hyperthyroidism<00:01:23.760> look<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.330> kidney<00:01:24.570> disease

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
hyperthyroidism look for kidney disease

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
hyperthyroidism look for kidney disease
etc<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.650> remember<00:01:26.160> that<00:01:26.520> bladder<00:01:26.730> cancer<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
etc and remember that bladder cancer is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
etc and remember that bladder cancer is
seen<00:01:27.660> in<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.900> cats<00:01:28.230> as<00:01:28.440> well<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.970> course

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
seen in all the cats as well of course

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.200 
seen in all the cats as well of course
what<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.870> cat<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.290> less<00:01:31.890> than<00:01:32.580> 10<00:01:32.940> years<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
what if the cat is less than 10 years of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
what if the cat is less than 10 years of
age<00:01:33.360> remember<00:01:34.020> that's<00:01:34.350> where<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.620> vast

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
age remember that's where the vast

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.040 
age remember that's where the vast
majority<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> our<00:01:36.060> cats<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.510> develop<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
majority of our cats that develop the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.840 
majority of our cats that develop the
status<00:01:37.440> there<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:37.980> be<00:01:38.010> less<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.460> 10<00:01:38.670> years

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
status there will be less than 10 years

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.290 
status there will be less than 10 years
of<00:01:38.940> age<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.830> 75%<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.910> them<00:01:42.090> are

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
of age so here about 75% of them are

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300 
of age so here about 75% of them are
going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.810> end<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.050> having<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.830> stress<00:01:44.070> bladder

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
going to end up having a stress bladder

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.430 
going to end up having a stress bladder
now<00:01:45.000> obviously<00:01:45.300> that's<00:01:45.450> 25%<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:46.350> could

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
now obviously that's 25% that could

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.200 
now obviously that's 25% that could
still<00:01:46.650> be<00:01:46.680> something<00:01:47.040> else<00:01:47.190> but<00:01:47.850> let's<00:01:48.000> not

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
still be something else but let's not

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
still be something else but let's not
dive<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.080> drastic<00:01:49.650> things

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
dive in and do drastic things

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
dive in and do drastic things
straightaway<00:01:50.460> unless<00:01:51.000> they're<00:01:51.240> obstructed

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
straightaway unless they're obstructed

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.360 
straightaway unless they're obstructed
and<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.680> were<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.890> talked<00:01:53.100> about

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
and that we were what you talked about

these are usually fit young cats and if
they're<00:02:31.019> not<00:02:31.049> blocked<00:02:31.409> then<00:02:31.799> that's<00:02:32.129> quite<00:02:32.340> an

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
they're not blocked then that's quite an

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.250 
they're not blocked then that's quite an
appropriate<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.120> forward<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.690> do<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
appropriate way forward I do like to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
appropriate way forward I do like to
know<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:35.129> their<00:02:35.280> kidneys<00:02:35.640> are<00:02:35.760> fine<00:02:35.909> to

know that their kidneys are fine to
start<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.750> easiest<00:02:37.110> way<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
start with and the easiest way is a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.789 
start with and the easiest way is a
urine<00:02:37.980> sample<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.390> I'm<00:02:40.349> gonna<00:02:40.500> make<00:02:40.650> those

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
urine sample so I'm gonna make those

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.440 
urine sample so I'm gonna make those
environmental<00:02:41.129> changes<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.849> if

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
environmental changes and if

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
kateri or something like that I might

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.640 
kateri or something like that I might
consider<00:04:11.040> tricyclics<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:12.690> all<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.530> things

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
consider tricyclics so all the things

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.800 
consider tricyclics so all the things
that<00:04:13.889> we<00:04:13.980> do<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.639> address<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.540> idiopathic

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
that we do to address the idiopathic

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.140 
that we do to address the idiopathic
cystitis<00:04:16.410> then<00:04:16.949> come<00:04:17.250> into<00:04:17.430> play<00:04:17.789> at<00:04:17.970> that

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
cystitis then come into play at that

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.479 
cystitis then come into play at that
point
