several tricks you should know about
though<00:00:21.330> while<00:00:22.230> dashing<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.070> quickly

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
though while dashing you can quickly

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.370 
though while dashing you can quickly
stop<00:00:23.760> by<00:00:24.210> pressing<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> block<00:00:24.900> button<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
stop by pressing the block button to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
stop by pressing the block button to
briefly<00:00:25.800> bring<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.400> shield<00:00:26.990> this<00:00:27.990> lets

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
briefly bring up your shield this lets

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
briefly bring up your shield this lets
you<00:00:28.349> run<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.980> then<00:00:29.130> cancel<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> run<00:00:29.849> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
you run in and then cancel the run so

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.700 
you run in and then cancel the run so
that<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> forward<00:00:31.199> tilt<00:00:31.560> or

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that you can do a forward tilt or

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.040 
that you can do a forward tilt or
something<00:00:32.070> instead<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.610> dash<00:00:32.759> attack

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
something instead of your dash attack

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.420 
something instead of your dash attack
even<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.320> important<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> dash

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
even more important is that if you dash

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
even more important is that if you dash
in<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.760> hold<00:00:35.910> your<00:00:36.059> shield<00:00:36.390> you'll<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.050> able

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
in and hold your shield you'll be able

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.990 
in and hold your shield you'll be able
to<00:00:37.290> keep<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.710> momentum<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.340> slide<00:00:38.640> forward

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to keep your momentum and slide forward

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
to keep your momentum and slide forward
just<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.329> bit<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.960> helps<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
just a little bit and that helps to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.709 
just a little bit and that helps to
extend<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.829> throw<00:00:41.129> range<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.360> far<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
extend your throw range see how far you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.700 
extend your throw range see how far you
can<00:00:42.870> throw<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.170> opponent<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
can throw the opponent with this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.569 
can throw the opponent with this
technique<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:46.800> cancel<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.399> dash

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
technique you can also cancel your dash

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
technique you can also cancel your dash
with<00:00:47.910> an<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.210> smash<00:00:48.600> instead<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> shield<00:00:49.829> but

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
with an up smash instead of a shield but

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.439 
with an up smash instead of a shield but
you<00:00:50.250> can't<00:00:50.430> cancel<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.090> any<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you can't cancel it into any of the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.049 
you can't cancel it into any of the
other<00:00:51.570> smashes<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:53.070> easiest<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> execute

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
other smashes it's easiest to execute

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.090 
other smashes it's easiest to execute
this<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> dash<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.289> press<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
this if you dash and then press up on

c-stick just makes it a little easier to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.060 
c-stick just makes it a little easier to
execute<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.649> smash<00:01:01.859> the

this<00:01:12.800> next<00:01:13.130> one's<00:01:13.280> pretty<00:01:13.520> hard<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.760> execute

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
this next one's pretty hard to execute

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.310 
this next one's pretty hard to execute
but<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:14.540> worth<00:01:14.690> learning<00:01:14.900> with<00:01:15.140> some

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
but it's worth learning with some

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.530 
but it's worth learning with some
characters<00:01:15.770> run<00:01:16.520> toward<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.940> opponent<00:01:17.450> and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
characters run toward the opponent and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.450 
characters run toward the opponent and
then<00:01:17.840> at<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.050> last<00:01:18.229> moment<00:01:18.530> hold<00:01:18.920> away<00:01:19.220> from

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
then at the last moment hold away from

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.950 
then at the last moment hold away from
them<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:19.820> turn<00:01:20.000> around<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.420> then<00:01:20.570> jump

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
them so you turn around and then jump

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.230 
them so you turn around and then jump
and<00:01:21.170> then<00:01:21.800> towards<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.400> opponent<00:01:22.640> press<00:01:23.000> a

this will let you get your aerial back
plus<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:26.119> attack<00:01:26.450> even<00:01:26.720> though<00:01:27.020> you're

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
plus a attack even though you're

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.200 
plus a attack even though you're
traveling<00:01:27.590> towards<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.220> opponent<00:01:28.460> instead

traveling towards the opponent instead

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.260 
traveling towards the opponent instead
of<00:01:29.300> away<00:01:29.360> from<00:01:29.660> them<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:31.430> purpose<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:31.910> this<00:01:31.970> is

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
of away from them the purpose of this is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.910 
of away from them the purpose of this is
that<00:01:32.390> many<00:01:32.600> characters<00:01:32.990> have<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.200> good<00:01:33.440> fast

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
that many characters have a good fast

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.880 
that many characters have a good fast

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
attack but slower towards a attacks so

that means he can jump way out to the
side<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.320> stage<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.890> glide<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.670> then<00:03:52.390> he
