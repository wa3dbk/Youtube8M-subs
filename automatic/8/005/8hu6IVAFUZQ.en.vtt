00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.380

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.270

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.790
 here before so a few new blocks 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.350
 which are added this whole 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.720
 You can find all blocks below these 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 whole or blocks and up here too 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.550
 again this is above the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.210
 zafira the ion is copper call it's 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.140
 very bronze exactly and or copper and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.000
 here we have once 10 am arnim and 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.290
 that is also a real stuff go 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 I have a few other burdens 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.070
 the blocks those for the stop me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.080
 the whole thing can still produce 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.370
 you for example sapphire and so on 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.720
 like me here too 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.190
 You can watch bronze 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.210
 I have all my strength now 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.100
 you have yourself for swords and such 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.390
 uranium packed in here so you can 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.620
 oranien blogger so you can always 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.420
 Also this blog here make you to 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.979
 for example this blog you have to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 By the way , then burn this itanium 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.860
 blog the completely new thing about it so 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.030
 For example, ruby is sapphire and 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.440
 then we have the whole one again 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.860
 power recipes for the very others 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.320
 stuff 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.270
 and that's how you get into the bronze needs 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.440
 for copper and tin 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.150
 then you can get this bronze in gold 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 Hereby you can tnt 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 create uranium tnt 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 I'll show you right then 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.530
 we have another weapon here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.910
 we have the bronze supplied in the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.190
 which I will also present today 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.160
 Then here rubies things then have 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.040
 we groups the ruby ​​sapphire and 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.150
 bronze things then have the here 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.950
 titanium blog can do that 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.500
 Use restoration to build 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.170
 then we still have it here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.640
 just bronze tools and i think 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.750
 I start weeks with the coolest and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.760
 though with the radium tnt 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.650
 I'll tell you before 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.820
 good pc and can be yours 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.909
 just smeared world and you 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.620
 of course, but he really should 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.450
 in a sale field or really 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.459
 very far from a left because 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.310
 this bomb here is a real one 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.050
 blockbuster and indeed 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.300
 immediately the ignites explodes the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.910
 Instance one already sees the right one 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.260
 everywhere in the area hurt me 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.290
 in the area a power stops 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.180
 a really fat hole and yes that is 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370
 stop the bomb and westend ebert us 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.140
 but then lie down again that's it 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.120
 cool on it but yes you can see already 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.349
 that makes a huge hole in the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.849
 Bock have it because it makes in any case 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.550
 but it does keep a huge hole 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.540
 yes, they have been this before 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.560
 is the beautiful thing about it tnt 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.330
 so now we come to the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.030
 swear and I'll show you that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.980
 a fix how to do this everything like that 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.959
 Expires with the new swords here 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.819
 which were actually added one 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.799
 very cool thing to start with the brawns 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.430
 The best time and drills once four 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:03.120
 strikes that the donation one there is 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.140
 still awake and two punches 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.640
 needed it is dead 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.860
 then he changes this time through the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.560
 french word out and look like 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.260
 many things can work 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.849
 12 so 2 then we have the next and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.709
 Although the sapphire sword and I know 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.910
 the technology pack that is relatively strong 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.420
 she stays the whole night 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.269
 been 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.280
 two hits then you have to get the sapphire 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.870
 and that ruby ​​and copper sword 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.769
 out and hit with the copper 1 and 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.150
 commer berner comes again two times 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.569
 but those are already the weapons and relative 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.640
 just like zac and dead on it 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.040
 the pick blog option is very, very 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.870
 nice but the swiss back 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.209
 and we'll see you soon 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.739
 whole tools so now we are at 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.780
 All the tools have come 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.560
 The interesting ones are the copper 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.850
 the ruby ​​and this one for the bronze pack 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.040
 I now have extra to that I could 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.760
 never one pack the box factor further 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.319
 bronze on 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.230
 from the from the depth to do that with from the 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.690
 game engine and dismantle I would 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.030
 let's say that's it could be 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.209
 Iron or diamond will be someone's level 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.769
 the shovel yes that's what I think 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.970
 it does not affect me on the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.160
 side because of that I can not accurate 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.180
 We call values ​​simply to judge 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.700
 sometimes he could do it himself 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.200
 judge the ax I guess there must 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.740
 i have the ex a wood for herborn i have 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.289
 got it for it says first off 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.389
 yes that is relatively fast so that 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.830
 now times what lawyers drawn 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.680
 same again but then the times 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.099
 others, let's start with the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.199
 saphire equipment on pac man for it yet 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.330
 put the pickaxe in it 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.889
 pickaxe you can already see that there 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.169
 really fast off that's it 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.539
 soon in zenting like it will say it is 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.620
 better than diamond you can see so 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.509
 really damn fast 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.310
 the current I do not now but before 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.650
 the shovel is doing well too 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.229
 is already at the ultimate is yes 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.289
 that really damned to zafira four 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.389
 quickly so that the Christian overflow 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.930
 the jemacht chop chop chop now 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.970
 times the ruby jewelry with ruby 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.800
 seems a bit better than 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.419
 shy to his soft soles bit 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 and the shovel does not appear if 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.240
 I'm the fastest one to see 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.830
 can 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.479
 So I would really be there for now 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.889
 I really want to be on favorites like that 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.460
 Anyway I play past a 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.139
 ran 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.240
 In any case, the favorite is still 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.819
 I can really recommend sapphire 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.259
 now the copper things out here 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.599
 now they are faster than ruby 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.610
 that's very strange but oh well 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.460
 I would appreciate that on the road again 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.659
 Here everything is good then again nice in 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.639
 Armor, but we'll see it soon 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.440
 after being equipped with things so 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.110
 until I am like that and at the 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.669
 Armor and we have different 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.930
 There are three pieces of armor this time around 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.880
 I think I did not hear it 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.229
 not even completely before animals gamemode purely 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.610
 and really do not look at me 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.030
 I think I have not 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.259
 belongs 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.039
 It would be exactly in three pieces 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.969
 There is bronze here and the titanium 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.889
 zack zack here you can see it already 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.909
 bronze titanium makes this content red 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.190
 I now prefer to order one time 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.210
 First of all you can see and the performance 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.830
 I think you have that one already 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.690
 can be determined by the tools 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.599
 which is really better and I have 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.819
 Now a santa claus's fine 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:20.069
 what of this motto view I hope 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.069
 you liked it and that was it
