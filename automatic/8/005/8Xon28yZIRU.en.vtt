00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.519
 hello very good to all how about how 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.019
 you are welcome to the youtube channel 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.520
 from senna court tv i am sergio me 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.800
 you can find on twitter by arroba 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.630
 is navas 10 on facebook, there is a boundary 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.090
 on our website sn code point 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.759
 net in this video well let's do the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.529
 analysis to a cydia tweet that is in 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.320
 the pivot repository has a price 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.010
 of $ 1.99 and it's called 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.170
 task master is brutally good because 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.239
 when we go to the spotlight we 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.770
 change completely so you are 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.719
 watching we have a volume control 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.670
 we have here the brightness control 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.000
 we have the typical all to activate 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.739
 disable wifi bluetooth enter mode 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.440
 do not disturb flight mode but it's that 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.000
 we also make a gesture such that this and 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.370
 note that here we have more touches 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.530
 we have all the important touches by 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.520
 the least accessible here also fix 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 those below we also have 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.149
 shortcuts to post a tweet 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.860
 a mention on facebook send an email 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.380
 or a 6 no 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.079
 also if we do the proper thing here to fix 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.490
 that we see information from our network 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.380
 agreement with all the information of 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.370
 our system the capacity that we have 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.590
 available that I have a 9.55 gigs left 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.810
 a little bit of space 72 for those who 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 also the battery and all this of 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.840
 agreement is pretty good because it 's 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.030
 quite accessible I have not said it but 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.980
 music sounded music controls 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.510
 we also have them here not this 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.760
 I like it a lot because you can see that 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.200
 we have accessible the spotlight as all 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.930
 life to fix you we can look 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.790
 contacts and whatever as always but 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.890
 it is also to notice that we have these 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.510
 all are cool here the truth that the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.250
 spotlight by default was a bit 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.800
 wasted because the truth is that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.750
 It was a screen just like everything 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.160
 this was empty and in spoleto what 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 we have up here as now no 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.580
 just the empty part with this 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.160
 tweet we are going to take advantage of this 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.360
 way and it seems pretty pretty 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.040
 productive I like it a lot I do not know 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.740
 what do you think but I think they are 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.300
 more click hub I recommend it and 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.220
 here I say goodbye thank you very much for having 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.220
 seen the video and see you in a next
