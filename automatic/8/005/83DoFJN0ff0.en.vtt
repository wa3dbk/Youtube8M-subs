00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
all right so just a little update I got

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.730 
all right so just a little update I got
a<00:00:12.840> new<00:00:13.200> map<00:00:13.440> from<00:00:14.040> brand<00:00:14.370> tuning<00:00:15.560> let<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.650> see

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a new map from brand tuning let me see

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.870 
a new map from brand tuning let me see
where<00:00:16.890> how<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.190> cord<00:00:17.460> go<00:00:17.640> oh<00:00:17.880> there<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.289> I

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
where how my cord go oh there it is so I

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.779 
where how my cord go oh there it is so I
switched<00:00:20.880> over<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:22.039> back<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> brenton<00:00:23.609> map

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
switched over to back to the brenton map

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.810 
switched over to back to the brenton map
instead<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> Cobb<00:00:24.510> protune<00:00:25.170> map<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:26.400> was

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
instead of the Cobb protune map I was

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.070 
instead of the Cobb protune map I was
just<00:00:26.970> bored<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.539> day<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.930> just

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
just bored one day and I was just

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.620 
just bored one day and I was just
curious<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.769> loaded<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> brand<00:00:30.150> toon<00:00:30.359> map

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
curious I loaded up the brand toon map

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.310 
curious I loaded up the brand toon map
and<00:00:31.130> lo<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> behold<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.059> felt<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.079> much

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and lo and behold they just felt so much

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
and lo and behold they just felt so much
stronger<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> Cobb<00:00:35.520> protune<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.540> if

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
stronger than the Cobb protune and if

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.780 
stronger than the Cobb protune and if
you<00:00:36.719> know<00:00:36.840> Cobb<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.440> cop<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.860> known<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.700> well

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you know Cobb the cop is known very well

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
you know Cobb the cop is known very well
for<00:00:40.640> tuning<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.879> safely<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.629> other<00:00:42.780> words

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
for tuning very safely in other words

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.790 
for tuning very safely in other words
I'm<00:00:43.680> gonna<00:00:43.829> help<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.160> damn<00:00:44.309> keys<00:00:45.800> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I'm gonna help my damn keys so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
I'm gonna help my damn keys so
especially<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> mid-range<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.210> felt<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
especially the mid-range it just felt so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.729 
especially the mid-range it just felt so
much<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.899> torque<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> me<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:51.140> I'm<00:00:52.140> gonna<00:00:52.350> load

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
much more torque to me so I'm gonna load

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.150 
much more torque to me so I'm gonna load
up<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.980> new<00:00:53.100> map<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:54.500> test<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
up the new map and then test it out and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
up the new map and then test it out and
also<00:00:56.420> with<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> Bren<00:00:57.930> tune<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.710> enabled

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
also with the Bren tune and also enabled

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
also with the Bren tune and also enabled
the<00:00:59.370> launch<00:01:00.030> control<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.629> flatfoot<00:01:01.140> shifting

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the launch control and flatfoot shifting

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.329 
the launch control and flatfoot shifting
which<00:01:02.309> I'll<00:01:02.460> probably<00:01:02.809> barely<00:01:03.809> use<00:01:04.199> unless<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
which I'll probably barely use unless I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.270 
which I'll probably barely use unless I
go<00:01:05.549> drag<00:01:06.390> racing<00:01:06.420> again<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.560> don't<00:01:08.070> plan

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
go drag racing again which I don't plan

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:19.990 
go drag racing again which I don't plan
on<00:01:08.340> doing<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:15.860> change<00:01:16.860> map<00:01:17.600> reflash

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
on doing very much change map reflash

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.590 
on doing very much change map reflash
hopefully<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.270> there

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
hopefully it's on there

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.890 
hopefully it's on there
there<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.049> stage<00:01:22.380> 2<00:01:22.650> lost<00:01:23.549> control<00:01:23.900> flat

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there you go stage 2 lost control flat

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.030 
there you go stage 2 lost control flat
foot<00:01:25.170> shifting<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> can

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
foot shifting I don't know if you can

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.240 
foot shifting I don't know if you can
see<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> full<00:01:26.700> focus<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:30.829> I'm<00:01:31.829> gonna<00:01:31.950> test<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
see that full focus so I'm gonna test it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.530 
see that full focus so I'm gonna test it
out<00:01:32.780> Brent<00:01:33.780> says<00:01:34.049> since<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:34.860> enabled<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.000> lost

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
out Brent says since he enabled the lost

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
out Brent says since he enabled the lost
control<00:01:36.780> flat<00:01:37.200> foot<00:01:37.380> shifting<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.490> know

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
control flat foot shifting that you know

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.660 
control flat foot shifting that you know
required<00:01:38.939> new<00:01:39.119> logs<00:01:40.430> hopefully<00:01:41.430> I'll<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
required new logs hopefully I'll get a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.899 
required new logs hopefully I'll get a
chance<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> usually<00:01:43.170> gets<00:01:43.909> congested

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
chance to do that usually gets congested

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
chance to do that usually gets congested
and<00:01:45.630> busy<00:01:46.530> around<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.100> am<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> Washington

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and busy around here I am in Washington

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.100 
and busy around here I am in Washington
State<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.600> probably<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
State and that's probably one of the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
State and that's probably one of the
slowest<00:01:49.530> states<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.890> far<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.159> freeway<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
slowest states as far as freeway as it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.899 
slowest states as far as freeway as it
goes<00:01:51.680> there's<00:01:52.680> any<00:01:53.189> other<00:01:53.369> place<00:01:53.579> I've<00:01:53.700> lived

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
goes there's any other place I've lived

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.780 
goes there's any other place I've lived
in<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.560> 60<00:01:55.560> mile<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.740> hour<00:01:55.829> speed<00:01:56.040> limits<00:01:56.490> they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
in so 60 mile an hour speed limits they

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.569 
in so 60 mile an hour speed limits they
require<00:01:57.090> Tunes<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.899> logs<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.560> Air<00:01:58.829> Gear<00:01:59.159> which

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
require Tunes or logs at Air Gear which

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.350 
require Tunes or logs at Air Gear which
is<00:01:59.700> about<00:01:59.850> 85<00:02:00.240> miles<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.600> hour<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:02.270> here<00:02:03.270> in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is about 85 miles an hour so here in

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.850 
is about 85 miles an hour so here in
Washington<00:02:03.719> state<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.020> 25<00:02:04.469> hour<00:02:04.649> speed

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
Washington state that's 25 hour speed

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.389 
Washington state that's 25 hour speed
limit

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
limit

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.380 
limit
that's<00:02:06.119> probably<00:02:06.420> jail<00:02:06.570> time<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
that's probably jail time so

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.240 
that's probably jail time so
wasn't<00:02:09.140> an<00:02:09.200> issue<00:02:09.290> back<00:02:09.800> when<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.010> lived<00:02:10.040> in

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
wasn't an issue back when I lived in

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.210 
wasn't an issue back when I lived in
California<00:02:10.370> or<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.750> know<00:02:11.840> 7080<00:02:12.800> there's<00:02:13.070> no

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
California or you know 7080 there's no

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.420 
California or you know 7080 there's no
big<00:02:13.460> deal<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.570> Washington<00:02:14.930> State

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
big deal but this is Washington State

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.350 
big deal but this is Washington State
yeah<00:02:16.430> no<00:02:16.790> joke

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.220 

so<00:02:20.360> got<00:02:20.780> lost<00:02:20.960> control<00:02:21.260> set<00:02:22.010> at<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.050> where

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so got lost control set at this is where

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.230 
so got lost control set at this is where
use<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.530> around<00:02:24.620> forty<00:02:25.010> six<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.340> hundred<00:02:25.670> rpm

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
use it around forty six one hundred rpm

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240

miles with a cop Pro tune I've drag
raced<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.169> bought<00:05:02.320> across<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.890> I've<00:05:03.040> taken

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
raced it I bought across it I've taken

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.430 
raced it I bought across it I've taken
it<00:05:03.520> on<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.640> race<00:05:03.850> track<00:05:04.090> so<00:05:04.570> I'm<00:05:04.930> pretty<00:05:05.230> much

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
it on a race track so I'm pretty much

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680 
it on a race track so I'm pretty much
familiar<00:05:05.710> on<00:05:06.250> how<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.790> runs<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.240> way<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.510> feels

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
familiar on how it runs the way it feels

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.810 
familiar on how it runs the way it feels
and<00:05:08.020> then<00:05:08.650> once<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.190> do<00:05:09.310> that<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.700> you

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
and then once you do that and you

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.900 
and then once you do that and you
compare<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.980> side<00:05:11.980> to<00:05:12.220> side<00:05:12.460> or<00:05:12.490> back<00:05:12.880> to

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
compare it to side to side or back to

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.090 
compare it to side to side or back to
back<00:05:13.180> with<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.540> different<00:05:13.780> tune<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.470> mean<00:05:14.950> you're

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
back with a different tune I mean you're

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.530 
back with a different tune I mean you're
gonna<00:05:15.190> feel<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.610> difference<00:05:16.180> whether<00:05:16.300> it's<00:05:16.480> an

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
gonna feel a difference whether it's an

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.690 
gonna feel a difference whether it's an
increase<00:05:16.870> or<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.050> decrease<00:05:17.140> but<00:05:17.680> in<00:05:17.919> this<00:05:18.430> case

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
increase or a decrease but in this case

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.810 
increase or a decrease but in this case
it<00:05:18.940> was<00:05:19.120> an<00:05:19.300> increase<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.990> power<00:05:20.520> mainly<00:05:21.520> in

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
it was an increase in power mainly in

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.420 
it was an increase in power mainly in
the<00:05:22.360> mid-range<00:05:22.660> around<00:05:23.650> let's<00:05:24.130> say<00:05:24.250> about

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
the mid-range around let's say about

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.890 
the mid-range around let's say about
3500<00:05:25.120> rpm<00:05:25.540> on<00:05:25.990> up<00:05:26.520> which<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.640> where<00:05:27.850> you<00:05:28.720> just

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
3500 rpm on up which is where you just

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.969 
3500 rpm on up which is where you just
feel<00:05:29.169> much<00:05:29.919> more<00:05:30.190> of<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.880> power<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:32.020> power

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
feel much more of a power a power

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.780 
feel much more of a power a power
increase<00:05:33.340> in<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:34.030> range<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:35.560> I'm<00:05:36.220> very

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
increase in that range so I'm very

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.140 
increase in that range so I'm very
tempted<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.570> take<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.930> on<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.470> dyno<00:05:38.760> spin<00:05:39.790> you

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
tempted to take it on the dyno spin you

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150 
tempted to take it on the dyno spin you
know<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.510> hundred<00:05:41.229> dollars<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.919> shop

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
know the hundred dollars that the shop

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.630 
know the hundred dollars that the shop
wants<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:43.510> charge<00:05:43.720> me<00:05:43.930> for<00:05:44.200> for<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.010> dyno<00:05:45.250> and

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
wants to charge me for for the dyno and

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.840 
wants to charge me for for the dyno and
just<00:05:46.540> compare<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.229> two<00:05:47.380> different<00:05:47.710> maps<00:05:47.890> so

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
just compare the two different maps so

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.760 
just compare the two different maps so
it<00:05:49.180> should<00:05:49.360> take<00:05:49.510> me<00:05:49.540> about<00:05:49.750> an<00:05:49.990> hour<00:05:50.110> maybe

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
it should take me about an hour maybe

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.270 
it should take me about an hour maybe
maybe<00:05:51.460> even<00:05:51.550> less<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.840> even<00:05:53.169> you<00:05:54.100> know<00:05:54.220> to

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
maybe even less to even you know to

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.150 
maybe even less to even you know to
compare<00:05:54.729> those<00:05:54.880> two<00:05:55.060> maps<00:05:55.240> all<00:05:55.770> d3<00:05:56.770> runs<00:05:57.010> on

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
compare those two maps all d3 runs on

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.250 
compare those two maps all d3 runs on
one<00:05:57.280> map<00:05:57.460> let<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.270> cool<00:05:58.390> down<00:05:58.450> do<00:05:58.810> three<00:05:59.020> runs

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
one map let it cool down do three runs

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.520 
one map let it cool down do three runs
on<00:05:59.620> another<00:05:59.860> map<00:06:00.360> take<00:06:01.360> two<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.200> highest

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
on another map take two of the highest

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.320 
on another map take two of the highest
ones<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:03.070> compared<00:06:03.700> to<00:06:03.850> and<00:06:03.970> over<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.240> line

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
ones and compared to and over the line

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.080 
ones and compared to and over the line
overlay<00:06:04.810> overlay<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:06.010> dyno<00:06:06.190> graphs<00:06:06.460> so

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
overlay overlay the dyno graphs so

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.570 
overlay overlay the dyno graphs so
that's<00:06:07.600> what<00:06:07.690> I'm<00:06:07.780> about<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.050> do<00:06:08.169> I'm<00:06:09.040> really

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
that's what I'm about to do I'm really

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.400 
that's what I'm about to do I'm really
highly<00:06:10.030> thinking<00:06:10.300> about<00:06:10.510> it<00:06:10.720> so<00:06:11.050> once<00:06:11.260> I<00:06:11.320> get

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
highly thinking about it so once I get

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.850 
highly thinking about it so once I get
the<00:06:11.530> funds<00:06:11.710> together<00:06:12.270> we'll<00:06:13.270> see<00:06:13.500> so<00:06:14.500> after<00:06:14.830> I

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
the funds together we'll see so after I

I<00:07:11.800> did<00:07:12.429> try<00:07:12.639> to<00:07:12.669> be<00:07:12.849> honest<00:07:13.209> about<00:07:13.329> it

I did try to be honest about it
so<00:07:14.050> maybe<00:07:14.889> they'll<00:07:15.039> catch<00:07:15.219> it<00:07:15.339> on<00:07:15.429> the<00:07:15.519> next

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
so maybe they'll catch it on the next

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.179 
so maybe they'll catch it on the next
oil<00:07:15.819> change<00:07:15.969> so<00:07:16.959> I<00:07:17.259> was<00:07:17.739> gonna<00:07:17.889> do<00:07:18.069> the<00:07:18.159> oil

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:18.189 
oil change so I was gonna do the oil

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:20.519 
oil change so I was gonna do the oil
change<00:07:18.550> myself<00:07:18.789> but<00:07:19.360> I<00:07:19.389> was<00:07:19.569> being<00:07:19.809> lazy<00:07:20.079> since

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:20.529 
change myself but I was being lazy since

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.439 
change myself but I was being lazy since
it<00:07:21.039> doesn't<00:07:21.309> really<00:07:21.429> cost<00:07:21.699> that<00:07:21.909> much<00:07:22.119> more<00:07:22.329> to

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
it doesn't really cost that much more to

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.959 
it doesn't really cost that much more to
have<00:07:22.599> a<00:07:22.629> dealership<00:07:23.050> do<00:07:23.199> it<00:07:23.459> if<00:07:24.459> you<00:07:24.699> have<00:07:24.939> a

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:24.969 
have a dealership do it if you have a

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.049 
have a dealership do it if you have a
government<00:07:25.869> discount<00:07:26.469> so<00:07:26.849> that's<00:07:27.849> where<00:07:27.969> I'm

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:28.059
