00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 equipment the most significant of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.830
 this update is that the range of 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.930

 also new colors and designs of the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.980
 alloy wheels 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.770
 the student's length has increased 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.690
 slightly and has gone from 395 to 397 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.440
 meters although the rest of measures are 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.850
 maintains with a width of 174 meters 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.130
 and a height of 142 meters 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.479
 the wheelbase or battle is of 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.479
 247 meters 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.810
 the student competes in the upper part of the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.030
 segment of the multipurpose utilities 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.620
 and his main rival is the mini in his 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 new generation has grown to the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.230
 382 meters in three doors and three with 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.060
 ninety-eight on five doors other 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.400
 possible competitors are the lancia 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 ypsilon that has a length of 384 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.540
 meters the ds3 which measures 395 meters and the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.540
 alfa romeo myth that measures 406 meters 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.800
 in the passenger compartment changes 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.940
 limit to some chrome details like 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.560
 in the controls of the power windows 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.560
 electric and new upholstery 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.340
 uv designers have not stopped 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.899
 a little aside the practical aspects and 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.520
 they have focused on the details that 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.819
 they show the quality and the image 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.350
 elegant materials and finishes enjoy 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 of a good perceived quality a 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.800
 step above what is usual 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.720
 in models the generalist manufacturers 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.370
 but details like the one before you of the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.650
 rear seats or the volume of the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.980
 trunk are behind many of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.870
 they 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.000
 the one testing has a trunk of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.799
 270 liters that can be expanded 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.170
 folding the rear seats up 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.060
 the 920 liters although under the floor is not 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.590
 has a spare wheel and only 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.129
 has a clip to repair 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.129
 punctures 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.950
 the engine of the tested version are 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.380
 four cylinders in gasoline line 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.360
 with 1.4 liters of displacement double tree 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.040
 of cams in cylinder head four valves 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.060
 turbo direct injection cylinder 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.340
 compressor the intercooler provides 125 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.050
 horsepower maximum only 5 thousand 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.730
 revolutions per minute and a reasonable 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.920
 pushing torque that holds the value 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 maximum between 1400 and 4000 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.280
 revolutions per minute so there are 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.990
 a good answer in almost all the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.360
 regime of use and it is not necessary 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.710
 go up to 6,000 revolutions of the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.710
 Red zone for fast rolling 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.780
 the driving force moves to the 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.489
 front wheels by means of a change 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.620
 automatic double clutch s tronic 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.299
 with 7 gears and the system is available 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.480
 stop to stand and start 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.310
 automatic in the arrests after being 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.930
 The steering wheel has some cams for 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 make the changes in manual mode 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.260
 sequential 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.880
 with a weight of one thousand 190 kilograms the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.250
 Car can accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.560
 kilometers per hour in 88 seconds and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.560
 reach 204 kilometers per hour 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.060
 the average consumption approved by audi is 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.100
 of 49 liters per 100 kilometers and in 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.470
 our test that we have measured 82 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.480
 liters per 100 kilometers the figure in 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.130
 real conditions is much higher than the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.600
 approved and must be qualified as 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.950
 elevated for a car of this size 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.950
 weight and benefits 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.590
 the address has assistance 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.330
 electrical variable depending on the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.160
 speed and disc brakes are the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.870
 four wheels with auto front 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.580
 ventilated and offer a good touch and 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.580
 forcefulness when needed 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.960
 the front suspension uses the 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.090
 classic mcpherson telescopic columns 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.150
 and the back is in charge of a single 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.040
 Torsion shaft with wheels thrown in 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.160
 the front axle has been mounted a bar 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.160
 stabilizer 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.189
 series is left over with wheels 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.289
 16 inch wheels that ride 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.669
 wide tires and low profile in 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.889
 measure 215 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.189
 45 although the test unit mounted 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.400
 some tires of measures 225 bar 35 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.469
 in 18-inch wheels so much rubber 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.300
 Harms consumption increases noise 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.680
 of rolling and is not good in case of 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.129
 heavy rain but that too 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.129
 aesthetically 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.430
 with the asphalt in good condition the car 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.110
 It is stuck to the ground and looks very flat in 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.730
 the curves what contributes to the 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.490
 agility since it can be sold with 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.130
 ease in the next curve in 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.930
 option for 235 euros offers a 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.910
 suspension of morons more sports 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.180
 although more uncomfortable in bumpy areas and 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.180
 for 665 euros the sports s line 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.290
 the car is easy to drive and has a 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.070
 similar to touch others offer 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.050
 larger size 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.520
 in the city it defends itself well and can be 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.380
 have an option with sensors 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.340
 distance front and rear as 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.340
 parking aid 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.710
 the position of the steering wheel that is flattened 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.590
 down is right with a seat 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.240
 While comfortable that it held the body there 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.170
 in addition a good support platform 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.170
 for the left foot 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.950
 as usual in the three doors the 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.660
 access to the rear seats is 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.820
 cumbersome and given the narrow width 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.530
 available only is approved for two 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.090
 places that do not have exits of 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.090
 adjustable air conditioner 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.330
 the test unit had the 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.919
 outdoor equipment package s line 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.720
 that has a price of one thousand nine hundred 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.580
 fifty euros and includes a spoiler 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.410
 integrated into the body that increases 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.849
 the dynamism of the image a grill 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.250
 of the radiator with specific design 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.819
 bumpers sports design and headlights 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.819
 anti-fog 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.840
 the tested version is the best equipped 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.880
 and includes as standard the elements of 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.650
 most important security and comfort but 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.360
 many other elements some already 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.040
 usual in lower priced cars 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.040
 they are only offered as an option 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.000
 What we liked the most was the 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.830
 quality materials and finishes as well as 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.760
 the agility in zones of curves and the 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.760
 brake behavior 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.240
 What we liked the least was the 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.250
 absence of spare wheel access 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.610
 to the rear seats and the policy of 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.610
 options
