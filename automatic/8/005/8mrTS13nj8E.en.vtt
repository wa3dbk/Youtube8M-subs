00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
right here this first part you simply

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.430 
right here this first part you simply
just<00:00:51.550> got<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:51.820> pull<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.030> out<00:00:52.270> it's<00:00:52.930> all<00:00:53.110> clipped

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
just got to pull it out it's all clipped

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.310 
just got to pull it out it's all clipped
on<00:00:54.090> easiest<00:00:55.090> method<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.480> found<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.899> do<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.050> is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
on easiest method I found to do that is

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.680 
on easiest method I found to do that is
to<00:00:56.469> grab<00:00:56.739> from<00:00:57.100> this<00:00:57.250> end<00:00:57.520> over<00:00:57.700> here<00:00:58.000> right

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
to grab from this end over here right

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.600 
to grab from this end over here right
here<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.230> just<00:00:59.410> pull<00:00:59.649> out<00:00:59.680> and<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.520> be

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
here and just pull out and just be

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.569 
here and just pull out and just be
gentle<00:01:00.850> with<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:02.410> you<00:01:03.190> don't<00:01:03.399> want<00:01:03.520> to

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
gentle with it because you don't want to

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.249 
gentle with it because you don't want to
break<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.910> clips<00:01:04.210> or<00:01:04.420> anything<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.080> just

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
break the clips or anything so it just

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.560 
break the clips or anything so it just
clips<00:01:05.560> on<00:01:05.710> like<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.130> all<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.490> way<00:01:06.580> across<00:01:06.759> so

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
clips on like that all the way across so

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.029 
clips on like that all the way across so
then<00:01:07.660> you<00:01:07.750> can<00:01:07.899> connect<00:01:08.229> disconnect<00:01:08.830> all

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
then you can connect disconnect all

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.070 
then you can connect disconnect all
these<00:01:09.220> cables<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:10.209> don't<00:01:10.360> have<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.569> worry<00:01:10.810> too

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
these cables you don't have to worry too

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.770 
these cables you don't have to worry too
much<00:01:11.110> about<00:01:11.819> which<00:01:12.819> one<00:01:13.179> goes<00:01:13.479> where<00:01:13.539> and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
much about which one goes where and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.180 
much about which one goes where and
keeping<00:01:14.200> up<00:01:14.350> with<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.709> because<00:01:14.830> it's<00:01:15.009> pretty

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
keeping up with it because it's pretty

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.760 
keeping up with it because it's pretty
easy<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.670> see<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.360> then<00:01:17.170> pretty<00:01:17.350> much<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.679> the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
easy to see and then pretty much on the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.540 
easy to see and then pretty much on the
clip<00:01:18.039> one<00:01:18.369> way<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.530> can<00:01:20.679> remove<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:20.950> if

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
clip one way but you can remove that if

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.359 
clip one way but you can remove that if
you'd<00:01:21.910> like<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:23.289> get<00:01:23.410> that<00:01:23.590> off<00:01:23.770> or<00:01:24.099> you<00:01:24.340> can

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
you'd like to get that off or you can

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.919 
you'd like to get that off or you can
just<00:01:24.729> what<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:24.940> found<00:01:25.179> easy<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.539> do<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.720> remove

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
just what I found easy to do is remove

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.660 
just what I found easy to do is remove
the<00:01:25.990> one<00:01:26.259> for<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.560> light<00:01:26.709> switch<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.369> that

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
the one for the light switch and that

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.309 
the one for the light switch and that
will<00:01:27.789> float<00:01:28.000> up<00:01:28.149> enough<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.509> hang<00:01:28.750> down<00:01:29.020> and

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
will float up enough to hang down and

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:30.870 
will float up enough to hang down and
then<00:01:29.560> it's<00:01:29.709> out<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:29.860> your<00:01:29.979> way<00:01:30.099> so<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.670> can

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
then it's out of your way so you can

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.730 
then it's out of your way so you can
remove<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.240> rest<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.599> the<00:01:31.660> panel<00:01:32.050> now<00:01:32.619> you're

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
remove the rest of the panel now you're

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.809 
remove the rest of the panel now you're
going<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.950> run<00:01:33.069> into<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.459> think<00:01:33.580> there's

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
going to run into you I think there's

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.330 
going to run into you I think there's
eight<00:01:34.030> screws<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.690> you're<00:01:34.780> going<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:34.929> hit

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
eight screws that you're going to hit

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.270 
eight screws that you're going to hit
across<00:01:36.340> here<00:01:36.849> a<00:01:37.110> couple<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.170> them<00:01:38.259> here<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.190> a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
across here a couple of them here and a

sitting up there just had to pull in a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.790 
sitting up there just had to pull in a
little<00:03:03.120> bit<00:03:03.360> get<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.600> loose<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.650> careful

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
work your way down it you'll get it off

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.130 
work your way down it you'll get it off
then<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:08.489> only<00:03:08.730> connected<00:03:09.150> unless<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
then it's only connected unless that

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.900 
then it's only connected unless that
happens<00:03:10.170> by<00:03:11.300> by<00:03:12.300> two<00:03:12.360> by<00:03:13.110> two<00:03:13.670> cables<00:03:14.670> right

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
happens by by two by two cables right

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.750 
happens by by two by two cables right
over<00:03:15.120> here<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.140> um<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.310> don't<00:03:17.370> necessary<00:03:17.700> have

over here so um you don't necessary have

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.949 
over here so um you don't necessary have
to<00:03:17.880> disconnect<00:03:18.360> those<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.780> get

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
to disconnect those if you can get

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.479 
to disconnect those if you can get
behind<00:03:19.110> here<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:19.739> it'll<00:03:19.830> be<00:03:19.950> easier<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.310> to

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
behind here but it'll be easier just to

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.759 
behind here but it'll be easier just to
pop<00:03:20.940> these<00:03:21.120> off<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.530> way<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.680> got

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
pop these off and that way you got

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.430 
pop these off and that way you got
access<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.850> could<00:03:24.180> easily<00:03:25.049> get

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
access to this so you could easily get

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.940 
access to this so you could easily get
back<00:03:25.680> there<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.519> I'm<00:03:27.269> going<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.450> do<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.660> next

kind<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:38.000> give<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.180> an<00:05:38.270> idea<00:05:38.420> it's<00:05:39.110> probably

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
kind of give you an idea it's probably

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.350

honestly<00:05:39.770> about<00:05:40.280> 20<00:05:40.640> minutes<00:05:40.880> job<00:05:41.090> that's

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
honestly about 20 minutes job that's

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.930 
honestly about 20 minutes job that's
about<00:05:41.570> it<00:05:41.750> that's<00:05:41.960> all<00:05:42.170> there<00:05:42.320> is<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:42.620> it

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
because even though it looks like it's

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.500 
because even though it looks like it's
extensive<00:05:45.800> it's<00:05:46.400> just<00:05:46.670> popping<00:05:47.120> off<00:05:47.240> some

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510
