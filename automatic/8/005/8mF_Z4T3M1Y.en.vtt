this main channel there'll be a couple

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.060 
this main channel there'll be a couple
of<00:00:34.420> cutouts<00:00:34.630> in<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.050> reef<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.739> there<00:00:35.860> should

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
of cutouts in the reef and there should

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.889 
of cutouts in the reef and there should
be<00:00:36.100> some<00:00:36.460> G<00:00:36.640> C's<00:00:36.850> waiting<00:00:37.270> an<00:00:37.360> ambush<00:00:37.720> there

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
be some G C's waiting an ambush there

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.479 
be some G C's waiting an ambush there
for<00:00:38.079> all<00:00:38.170> fish<00:00:38.469> to<00:00:38.590> get<00:00:38.680> sucked<00:00:38.950> off<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.250> flats

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
for all fish to get sucked off of flats

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.490 
for all fish to get sucked off of flats
once<00:00:39.969> we've<00:00:40.180> done<00:00:40.329> that<00:00:40.390> we'll<00:00:40.960> make<00:00:41.110> best<00:00:41.380> use

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
once we've done that we'll make best use

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.319 
once we've done that we'll make best use
of<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.829> tides<00:00:42.100> we've<00:00:42.399> got<00:00:42.520> about<00:00:42.700> an<00:00:42.940> hour

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
of the tides we've got about an hour

of the tides we've got about an hour
left<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:44.320> run<00:00:44.469> outside<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.070> reef

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
left of the run outside and the reef

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.040 
left of the run outside and the reef
will<00:00:45.370> be<00:00:45.460> really<00:00:45.790> really<00:00:46.000> shallow<00:00:46.239> right<00:00:46.899> on

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
will be really really shallow right on

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.450 
will be really really shallow right on
the<00:00:47.110> back<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.530> reef<00:00:47.710> will<00:00:47.920> have<00:00:48.100> water

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
the back of the reef will have water

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.400 
the back of the reef will have water
draining<00:00:49.000> off<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.239> flats<00:00:49.540> into<00:00:50.170> little

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
draining off the flats into little

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.779 
draining off the flats into little
drains<00:00:50.710> we'll<00:00:50.980> just<00:00:51.190> go<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.370> find<00:00:51.579> those

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
drains we'll just go and find those

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:52.979 
drains we'll just go and find those
little<00:00:51.969> drains<00:00:52.270> at<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.480> back<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.840> reef

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
little drains at the back of the reef

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.410 
little drains at the back of the reef
and<00:00:53.260> all<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.370> fish<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.700> are<00:00:54.789> on<00:00:54.910> those<00:00:55.030> flats

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
and all the fish that are on those flats

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.119 
and all the fish that are on those flats
always<00:00:55.750> they'll<00:00:55.960> go<00:00:56.140> after<00:00:56.289> those<00:00:56.590> jane<00:00:56.860> too

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
always they'll go after those jane too

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.260 
always they'll go after those jane too
so<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.399> should<00:00:57.579> be<00:00:57.730> really<00:00:57.969> good<00:00:58.090> we've<00:00:58.239> got

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270

corner<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> pointman<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:32.009> not

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
corner the pointman there so we're not

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.289 
corner the pointman there so we're not
going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.430> too<00:01:32.610> much<00:01:32.640> pressure<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.180> him

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
going to put too much pressure on him

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
slider coming around we can put a bit
more<00:01:39.299> Hertz<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.810> him<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.189> when<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.340> pull<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
more Hertz on him now when you pull the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.389 
more Hertz on him now when you pull the
fish<00:01:41.880> hard<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.509> guys<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
fish hard like that guys and you're in a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
fish hard like that guys and you're in a
sticky<00:01:44.399> situation<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.420> try<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.690> cut

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
sticky situation they will try and cut

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.910 
sticky situation they will try and cut
you<00:01:46.110> off<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> little<00:01:46.680> bit

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you off but if you're a little bit

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.920 
you off but if you're a little bit
softer<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.640> often<00:01:48.330> they'll<00:01:48.450> swim<00:01:48.720> back

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
softer on them often they'll swim back

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
softer on them often they'll swim back
out<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.380> reef<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.830> it's<00:01:50.369> exactly<00:01:50.729> what's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
out of the reef so it's exactly what's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.590 
out of the reef so it's exactly what's
happened<00:01:51.240> here

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.520 

you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.899> over<00:01:55.049> there

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you have a look over there

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
you have a look over there
we<00:01:55.979> hooked<00:01:56.190> him<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> corner<00:01:56.970> there

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
we hooked him around on the corner there

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.570 
we hooked him around on the corner there
you<00:01:57.630> went<00:01:57.750> around<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.319> just<00:01:58.350> gave<00:01:59.220> them<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> bit

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
you went around we just gave them a bit

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.059 
you went around we just gave them a bit
of<00:01:59.670> slack<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> came<00:02:01.530> back<00:02:01.560> around<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
of slack and you came back around the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.529 
of slack and you came back around the
reef

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:24.150

three drains coming out of one

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.570 
three drains coming out of one
particular<00:02:48.110> area<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.800> that's<00:02:49.430> an

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
particular area there and that's an

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.430 
particular area there and that's an
ideal<00:02:49.880> scenario<00:02:50.120> because<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.840> front<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.350> those

ideal scenario because in front of those
drains<00:02:51.860> there's<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.220> massive<00:02:52.550> coral<00:02:53.030> flat<00:02:53.270> so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
they would have no doubt been possibly

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.330 
they would have no doubt been possibly
hundreds<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.110> GT<00:02:57.410> feeding<00:02:57.830> on<00:02:57.920> those<00:02:58.040> flats

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
hundreds of GT feeding on those flats

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.730 
hundreds of GT feeding on those flats
cheering<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:58.820> hot<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.270> they<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.560> come

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
off the flat somewhere and that comes

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.970 
off the flat somewhere and that comes
straight<00:03:02.930> out<00:03:02.990> of<00:03:03.200> these<00:03:03.320> chains<00:03:03.590> at<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.800> end

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
