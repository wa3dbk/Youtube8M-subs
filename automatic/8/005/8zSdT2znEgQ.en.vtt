00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello today tell about the company 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.130
 xd 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.840
 or xd do not know how to pronounce 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 their model x 2 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.369
 This is a very inexpensive player that is not 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.920
 less offers good sound for your 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.710
 money it is sold in such a white 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 boxes cost less than $ 60 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.550
 so the purchase is very interesting except 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 most of the gliders you get more 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.640
 micro beaten cords and there are a couple 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.300
 The instructions included are essentially 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 the eldest brother of the famous sans player 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.850
 glue in general, he also does not have 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 dedicated digital to analog 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 the converter uses the system not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 chip but here she found a place for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.980
 high-grade amplifier that's used 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.960
 lm h6 from 6:43 so the sound 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.519
 more interesting than sansa case is very 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.130
 very high quality aluminum 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.000
 actually for 60 dollars 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.000
 everything is collected very cool and there is butt 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 there is a slot for micro sd 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.659
 rs3 micro usb is located at the bottom of the exit to 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.020
 Headphones 3 on the front of 5 buttons 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.850
 and extra line button 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.619
 the screen here in general is practically brother 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 the fact that the sansa clip is installed and also 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.229
 oled screen with two colors control 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.390
 a little chinese okay get used to 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.429
 and read the instructions but the sound is very 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.649
 not bad, he is quite natural 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.289
 neutral without snacking too much 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.640
 Well articulate them bass since 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.709
 gain done pretty well 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.590
 principle the main nagging of course in 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.280
 that since there is no west then micro 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.459
 the detail suffers because of this scene 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.149
 average width is not imaginary and 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.280
 proper depths 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.130
 Should I miss the separation of plans 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.769
 music as myself but I repeat once again for 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.890
 $ 60 solution is great 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.280
 A good player is suitable for summer or 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.880
 for compact if you need a compact 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.709
 player 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.500
 Well, in principle, if you are limited 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.650
 budget you can add good 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.290
 cheap headphones well for example sharp 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 who's with him casey 06 and who's with him 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.160
 good very fit and work 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.250
 very very good bunch 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 for an audiophile with a limited budget 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.760
 winter axles
