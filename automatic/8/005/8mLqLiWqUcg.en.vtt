00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.690
 the veterinary medicine light lópez 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.479
 Rodriguez moves from his truck 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.820
 pits àmbits where you receive inquiries and 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.950
 cater to pets today will speak to us 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.890
 about the zeal of the dogs since 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.750
 many people do not know how long or 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.450
 how to care for your pet during this 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.920
 time or how to cross the zeal as such 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.920
 in the dogs it has several phases 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.630
 we start with a phase called the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.640
 project we call the project is 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.890
 the initial phase is where we started 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.320
 notice certain physical changes 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.469
 physical as well as behavioral 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 when the pse of the 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.149
 vulva starts to increase in size 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.829
 we started with an urban edema and then 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.559
 she also starts to be a little more 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.649
 restless and we start with the most uncomfortable 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.530
 sign that is the bleeding that you notice in 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.579
 the houses enough when you must cross 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.739
 the waiting phase about 5 to 15 days and it's 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.429
 where the vulva continues to increase in size 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.469
 but it will decrease slightly phase 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.299
 bleeding and that's when the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.430
 ovulation in that phase approaches the 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.610
 ovulation that is more or less daily 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.050
 at 15 having started the zeal in that 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.760
 moment is when you have to have a lot 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.010
 more careful because it's when she can 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.630
 get loaded in those in this week 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.510
 which is when the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.070
 bleeding is when it will be charged and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.020
 is when she will be receptive to 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.200
 the male in the previous phases she does not 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.600
 is receptive to males what are the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.479
 days the odyssey in ovulation then 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.130
 we take as zero days the first day of 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.229
 bleeding day 1 is the first day of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.500
 bleeding from then on we have 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.990
 eight days for little dogs used to 10 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 for big dogs and until the day 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.450
 15 or day 13 effectively we will do 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.460
 make the assembly in that week 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 those are the days of ovulation should be 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.149
 make about two or three fines for 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030
 ensure then that the dog 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.270
 stay pregnant as choosing the dog 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.880
 dogs in the heat phase as such 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.310
 when they are at ovulation 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.890
 they accept the dogs at what time 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.679
 then it is better that you choose the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 puppy and the owners choose it and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.490
 take into account the size of the puppy 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.440
 that is not much bigger than the 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.540
 because that means you 're going to have a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.970
 history or some kind of complication in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.740
 the moment of delivery ideally be 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.900
 of your race that is a healthy dog ​​that does not 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.060
 have congenital diseases that is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.730
 free of diseases like dysplasia of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.920
 hip or a puppy that does not have 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.230
 retained testicle that has had a 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.150
 previous review there is also 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.370
 infernal sexually transmitted 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.020
 dogs then they have reviewed very 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.870
 While the two pets before 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.650
 make the fine the good pregnancy 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.780
 during pregnancy are from 63 to 65 days 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.200
 of pregnancy are also divided into three 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.250
 thirds the third the initial and noble well 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.750
 it's just behavior change 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.050
 from her it says to be a little bit more 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.090
 Calm down to eat a little more and already at 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.130
 end of pregnancy you can already see the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 increase in size then of the area 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.160
 abdominal forgiveness and starts producing 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.230
 milk also changes in the diet 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 have to have a little more calcium and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.650
 more than phosphorus because equal the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.330
 puppies is what they need most and what 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.840
 they will take from the mother if they are not 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.120
 having 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.709
 then the diet that is handled in 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.190
 pregnant females usually 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.810
 supplements with vitamins with minerals or 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.959
 You can also administer the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.670
 puppy food that is very rich in 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.459
 calcium and elves what are the cares 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.200
 what to have with the girls 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.260
 take care of them very well because as I say 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.080
 they do not choose the male they can 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.900
 get to run away in the days of the 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.849
 ovulation to look for a male then 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.920
 at the time of the ride take her with her 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.079
 strap if you can suddenly change the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.599
 walking times to avoid so many 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.730
 male dogs in the park that 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.680
 They can continue to the house and wait 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.860
 come out and then there are mounts 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.810
 unwanted hygienic wipes that 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.310
 it's a good thing to do a good measure of 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.620
 hygiene for pet hygiene 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.870
 They are like panties with a 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.970
 underwear for losses that come 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.280
 with a hole for the tail and a 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.560
 hole to put as a protector and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.190
 that is constantly changing 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.350
 obviously it controls the bleeding of the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.110
 drip that can be very constant in 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.560
 the house but does not control a pain 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.780
 is the one that detects if you do not want to cross 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.340
 what is the alternative to avoid the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.949
 bleeding and avoid those complications 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.990
 but the long- term sterilization 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.939
 it avoids them enough diseases also 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.939
 and the unwanted fines
