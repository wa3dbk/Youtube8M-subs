00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:12.440
 only no no no no no no no bosses 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.750
 welcome that I open trying to start 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.350
 with this machine in any case this 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 departure of is encouraged is not live 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.870
 and here we are going to see how he managed 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.510
 unlock the mission 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.430
 my own determiners to generate 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.670
 21 consists of 100 deaths by carbine 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.990
 and a death a little tree I call him 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.990
 spiritual as you are 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.760
 I started here 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.480
 Well, I was pointing out that there was an individual 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 near these pipes apparently already 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.649
 he was killed 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.170
 the tip say the robot 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.839
 looking at the wheels to see what right 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.409
 at the same time it makes it possible to manage it costs 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:09.200
 many times to handle it 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.740
 unless the land is going home 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.740
 for other 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.150
 it does not have a constant, it seems that 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.700
 get used to being able to handle it like 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.460
 a caterpillar 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.390
 and that has subtraction is very good 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.390
 but equally the one who knows how to handle 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:38.670
 I'm looking for what to try 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.689
 do not move this direction is lost 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.579
 what are we going to do a forward right now 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.420
 I'm in treatment on wheels for 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.420
 know what is my right ahead 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.930
 If we are from above, there is a 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.430
 sniper 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.500
 and there you hear a bluff and that's where 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.180
 I want him to try to get fired for 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.260
 I can not kill myself, there is no other 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.710
 what to escape 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.730
 when a soldier in front is difficult 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.730
 to win so 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.640
 this is going to serve me for another 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.710
 let's find 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.849
 it is important to always observe the minimum 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.450
 to see if it appears 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.819
 your 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.020
 it's about surprising them from the back 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.020
 all are at a high level 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 they have been important changes 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.750
 but 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.110
 I try to follow it but it is difficult to 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.360
 they realize 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.570
 but then I realized so I 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.570
 I go 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.120
 190 that does not destroy it we are with 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.530
 tickets 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.530
 and already very good they killed him 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.040
 with the sea 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.920
 but he has not just left the team 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.240
 there is our killed what rage 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.650
 but good 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.959
 let's keep looking 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.019
 and right now tell me where the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.140
 tanks to surprise him from behind and 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.100
 A) Yes 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.100
 make them explode 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.140
 but good 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.970
 and today's 1 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.410
 if it shows in the audio like that 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.410
 lost the arch audio 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.159
 A comrade is arriving 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.380
 you hear the tank on the right 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.040
 we have there is marked 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.040
 a pleasure 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:22.460
 so that I have another 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.460
 this does not appear other in the diet 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.520
 the account was given 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.160
 well it was a little bit of patience the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.080
 key I think it's a patience 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.200
 with patience coordinate serves new 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.200
 language 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.480
 which this right say no to 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.400
 heal us move the right joystick to 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.320
 that the tip I do not know from standing and so you 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.670
 is not going to move right to the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.730
 left when they want to go towards 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.730
 ahead 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.320
 that would be all thanks for your 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.320
 appreciation 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.690
 we will have more videos
