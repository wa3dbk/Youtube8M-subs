made me as lean as doing these hundred
squats<00:00:22.119> I<00:00:22.509> always<00:00:23.470> thought<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:23.739> was<00:00:23.800> pretty

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
lean to begin with but looking back I

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.210 
lean to begin with but looking back I
think<00:00:27.099> otherwise

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
think otherwise

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.159
