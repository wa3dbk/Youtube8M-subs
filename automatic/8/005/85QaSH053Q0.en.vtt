 hello very good soldier and all hear 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.980
 uncles to bottom dotcom I bring you a 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.580
 small video with the content of what 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.080
 leads to the new year 7.1 for iphone this 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.180
 tomorrow he has tried an iphone 4 and the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.119
 truth is that we have given a slight 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.820
 improvement in stability ie 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.619
 when we go from menus to pages of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.390
 applications because the truth is that it 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.460
 something much faster and we think that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.789
 us the area so much I hope that in the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.749
 official release continue like this and that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.880
 a little happy for iphone users 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.940
 4 that the truth is that it was a little 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.480
 slow they come without more we go we started 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.120
 with notifications that now when 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.510
 we do not have any notification what puts 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.839
 here no notification not attended 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.560
 It is an improvement that some people good 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.270
 will be useful and others will not 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.579
 Corrections and stability improvements 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.480
 internal 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.600
 if they have not said data but I think that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.939
 they refer to iphone4 the truth is that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.220
 I would like you to see soon soon 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.100
 see if I get an iphone 4 and I make a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.650
 video 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.610
 new auto hr function in the app 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.040
 camera ok let's go to the camera but 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 it is only for iphone 5 s ie 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.360
 we go here we click here 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.420
 up and we will get 3 3 little eyelash but 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 and auto 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.109
 good next news keyboard okay 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.390
 keyboard let's make general adjustments 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.720
 accessibility 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.850
 and here we have one that has added a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.740
 little window that puts dark keyboard and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.470
 now when good if we have it 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.729
 activated clear we can write that is the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.310
 keyboard is dark and the truth is that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.740
 it's pretty good 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.960
 Here I'm going to teach you see keyboard 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.270
 Dark 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.820
 well this is all about tastes there 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.869
 people who like there are people who do not 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.300
 you can put it that you can not 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.560
 put that we have forced also have 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.990
 put in accessibility the adjustment of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.390
 darken colors that I'm going to teach 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.910
 increase contrast beige darken 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.520
 colors all this I also wear it 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.560
 I say it is for tastes not everything is going to 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.410
 like the darker phone or the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.240
 dark keyboard 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.700
 and finally they have added a new 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.560
 Dialog when restarting iphone5 s 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.569
 I do not have iphone 5s so I'm not going 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.349
 to be able to teach 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.599
 and also if for example your restart is 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.999
 the factory phone the touch and you 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.310
 will ask for password I guess it will be a 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.569
 security measure or I have no idea 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.530
 but I am what I 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.530
 imagined 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.819

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.650
