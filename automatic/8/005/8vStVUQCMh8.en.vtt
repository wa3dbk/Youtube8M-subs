here<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.140> testing<00:00:07.259> Omni<00:00:07.859> dry<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.309> our

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
here we're testing Omni dry in our

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.370 
here we're testing Omni dry in our
environmental<00:00:09.000> chamber<00:00:09.420> which<00:00:09.750> allows<00:00:10.080> us<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
environmental chamber which allows us to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.890 
environmental chamber which allows us to
see<00:00:10.559> things<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> industry<00:00:11.880> can't<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
see things that the industry can't and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.089 
see things that the industry can't and
that's<00:00:12.990> because<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.590> create<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> full

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
that's because we can create a full

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.129 
that's because we can create a full
storm<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.240> water<00:00:15.719> coming<00:00:15.960> from

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
storm in here with water coming from

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
storm in here with water coming from
above<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.800> from<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> side<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.940> well<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.390> high

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630

above and from the side as well as high
levels<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.109> wind<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.590> then<00:00:20.250> watch<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.970> for

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
levels of wind and then watch that for

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.060 
levels of wind and then watch that for
hours<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.630> end<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.560> seeing<00:00:22.769> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
hours on end and what we're seeing is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
hours on end and what we're seeing is
the<00:00:23.519> water<00:00:23.730> repellency<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.600> standing<00:00:25.140> up

the water repellency is standing up
fabulously<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.730> also<00:00:26.880> there's<00:00:27.210> absolutely

passage<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.520> an<00:00:47.969> important<00:00:48.510> comfort

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
passage is actually an important comfort

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.950 
passage is actually an important comfort
mechanism<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> allows<00:00:51.270> cold<00:00:51.780> air

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

our beta test project let's have a look
at<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.460> Omni<00:01:05.729> drive<00:01:05.939> technology<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
at that the Omni drive technology it's a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
at that the Omni drive technology it's a
one<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> lightest<00:01:07.470> weight<00:01:07.619> jackets<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> own

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
one of the lightest weight jackets I own

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
one of the lightest weight jackets I own
and<00:01:08.490> yet<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> performs<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.780> heavy

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and yet it performs like it's a heavy

weight jacket this jacket has replaced

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
weight jacket this jacket has replaced
at<00:01:12.510> least<00:01:12.540> 3<00:01:12.960> garments<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.770> backpack<00:01:14.070> with

the jacket like this I would expect it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.050 
the jacket like this I would expect it
to<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.590> pit<00:01:16.860> zips<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to have pit zips on it but with the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
to have pit zips on it but with the
breathability<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.840> doesn't<00:01:19.110> need<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.680> all

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
breathability it doesn't need it at all

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
breathability it doesn't need it at all
I<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.460> yet<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.390> moisture

I have yet to see any moisture
underneath<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.220> jacket<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
underneath when I put this jacket on I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
underneath when I put this jacket on I
thought<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.659> sweaty<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> did

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
thought I was gonna get sweaty and I did

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.550 
thought I was gonna get sweaty and I did
2<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:25.920> 3<00:01:26.220> hours<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> rain<00:01:27.119> anything<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> going

2 or 3 hours of rain anything is going

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.660 
2 or 3 hours of rain anything is going
to<00:01:28.710> soaked<00:01:29.220> through

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to soaked through

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
to soaked through
so<00:01:30.270> far<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> haven't<00:01:31.110> found<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:32.009> true

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so far I haven't found that to be true

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
so far I haven't found that to be true
with<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.090> jacket<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.990> good<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:34.409> it's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
with this jacket it's good when it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
with this jacket it's good when it's
cold<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.820> too

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
cold out it's good when it's not too

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210 
cold out it's good when it's not too
cold<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.780> kind<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.259> my<00:01:37.409> go-to<00:01:37.439> jacket

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
cold out it's kind of my go-to jacket

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.310 
cold out it's kind of my go-to jacket
it's<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.520> fantastic<00:01:39.180> viking<00:01:39.570> jacket<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.110> only

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's a fantastic viking jacket not only

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.920 
it's a fantastic viking jacket not only
has<00:01:40.470> breathability<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.610> has<00:01:41.820> mobility<00:01:42.450> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
has breathability but it has mobility so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020 
has breathability but it has mobility so
fabric<00:01:43.229> has<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> very<00:01:43.860> nice<00:01:44.040> feel<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.729> the
