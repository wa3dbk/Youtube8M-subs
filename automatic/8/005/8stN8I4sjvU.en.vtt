how it swims on the stealth fighter so
the<00:02:09.690> 3d<00:02:09.929> crayfish<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> stealth<00:02:11.250> fighter

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the 3d crayfish on a stealth fighter

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.510 
the 3d crayfish on a stealth fighter
little<00:02:13.170> spike<00:02:13.560> goes<00:02:13.800> underneath<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:14.430> I'll

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
little spike goes underneath here I'll

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.010 
little spike goes underneath here I'll
show<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.760> how<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.000> put<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.570> real<00:02:15.750> fast

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
show you how to put that in real fast

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.490 
show you how to put that in real fast
and<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.740> got<00:02:16.950> nose<00:02:17.760> hook<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.500> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and then you got nose hook like that and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.980 
and then you got nose hook like that and
what<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.010> does<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.560> creates<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
what it does is that it creates a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.510 
what it does is that it creates a
stealthy<00:02:24.990> lure<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:26.010> actually<00:02:26.130> swim

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
stealthy lure that will actually swim

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.990 
stealthy lure that will actually swim
