 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.720
 Hello everyone, you are arrogantly 73 and today we 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.150
 let 's talk about such a medium tank 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.970
 tenth level object 140 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.790
 many have in the hangar t-62 say that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.529
 object 140 and I need to see if the tanks 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.590
 same and waste your precious 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.140
 time they do not want but such players 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.649
 drastically wrong these are two absolutely 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.320
 different tank outwardly they are very friend to 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.080
 friends are alike and so many think that 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.460
 they are the same but have seen many 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.340
 players world of tanks blitz 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.490
 I will say that object 140 is one of 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.840
 best medium tanks of the tenth level 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.850
 what unites these tanks 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 so this is only damage per shot and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.079
 penetration of the base projectile 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.210
 true damage to all three hundred points already 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.600
 somehow it doesnâ€™t look like much 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.369
 st level 10 but it is compensated 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.890
 fierce rate of fire at nine 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.929
 shots per minute that gives us dpm 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.200
 equal to 2,700 units 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.409
 not every c-cabinet except t-62a of course 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.850
 possesses dpm higher for what else can 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.950
 love object 140 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.490
 this is his vertical guidance angles 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.249
 which are -6 degrees down to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.049
 someone will say that it is not enough but not worth it 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:32.539
 forget that you play in the Soviet 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.009
 tank and as usual in Soviet tanks 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.770
 rather mediocre angles 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.039
 vertical guidance stabilization 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.499
 object 140 is also better than t-62a on 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.020
 go we get much more often than our brother 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.630
 accuracy of 035 and time information in two 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.850
 seconds will let us play effectively 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.679
 long-distance damage dealer 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.109
 also do not forget about the good 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.409
 dynamic object 140 powerful engine 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.719
 facility is 580 horsepower 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.270
 which gives us a power density of 16 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.189
 horses per ton maximum speed we have above 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.499
 than a fellow even if only 5 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.330
 kilometers per hour but sometimes these five 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.750
 kilometers per hour play very large 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.030
 role on the battlefield in principle tanchik very 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.790
 perky and where needed 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.550
 your support you can always quickly 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.270
 go there what else can be noted 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.180
 an object 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.030
 it's pretty strong brow tower there we have 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.270
 240 millimeters but at the same time we have a very 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.980
 vulnerable and the roof of the tower in contrast to the t-62a 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.010
 which has the whole tower 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.230
 impenetrable roof we have only 30 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.050
 millimeters let there go and pretty hard 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.210
 get there but still it is possible therefore 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.520
 if you suddenly whistled from a slope then not 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.960
 wait for the weather by the sea and the land mine 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 some yagi e100 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.310
 won't forgive you either 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.190
 forget about the rule of three calibers 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.170
 which says that any weapon starts 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.660
 90 millimeters will be guaranteed 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.680
 punch your roof so when playing on 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.470
 object 140 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.260
 guard the roof of the tower in the forehead of the hull 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.480
 we are 100 millimeters and it seems like little but 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.300
 in the reduced state, the armor reaches 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.820
 200 marks 46 one hundred millimeters 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.460
 percent she will not save you but knowing 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.190
 cheat armor of soviet tanks sometimes 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.180
 you will ricochet quite large 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.370
 woman halka 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.340
 well let's talk about tactics 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.890
 fighting on site 140 is best 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.070
 play a platoon because the damage per shot is not 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.440
 especially large and 1 E100 disassemble your 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.330
 it will be hard but together with his 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.850
 platoon you will represent 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.130
 a huge threat in general to the whole team 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.740
 the enemy as a whole if you play 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.100
 one you must act all the time 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.720
 aggressively bypass the enemy from the rear 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.030
 in every way to divert it to themselves to 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.730
 so your allies can roll out 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.250
 and throw in the abuser also feel free 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.350
 shoot on the go and stabilize the gun 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.590
 you will be of great help with this 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.170
 let's consider all the pros and cons 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.920
 This car to the pluses can be attributed 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.320
 good booking wildest dp 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.040
 excellent accuracy and speed information 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.410
 excellent dynamics 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 by cons weak roof booking 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.770
 towers 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.290
 low damage per shot summing up 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.600
 I want to say that object 140 is the best 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.410
 medium tank of the tenth level yes 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.200
 undoubtedly t-62a is also good but personally 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.190
 me, object 140 would be a favorite if 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.070
 I had a choice 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.620
 Originally what 110 to swing then I would 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.720
 chose object 140 but since led him 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.960
 we recently 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.660
 I had to turn off the t-62A well, and on this I 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.520
