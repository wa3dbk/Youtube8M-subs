00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.330 

let's<00:00:12.269> use<00:00:12.450> some<00:00:12.630> real<00:00:12.870> bones<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.710> reference

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
let's use some real bones as reference

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
let's use some real bones as reference
it's<00:00:14.880> good<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.570> full<00:00:15.929> sized<00:00:16.260> human

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
it's good to have a full sized human

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
it's good to have a full sized human
skeleton<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.550> cast<00:00:17.970> from<00:00:18.300> real<00:00:18.480> bones<00:00:18.750> so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
skeleton one cast from real bones so

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
skeleton one cast from real bones so
that<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.260> compare<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.130> actual

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that you can compare this to your actual

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.240 
that you can compare this to your actual
body<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> problem<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:23.010> these

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
body but the problem is that these

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.450 
body but the problem is that these
things<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.880> riveted<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.039> doesn't

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
things are riveted so that it doesn't

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.060 
things are riveted so that it doesn't
move<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> human<00:00:27.269> skeleton<00:00:27.750> moves<00:00:28.230> there

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
move like a human skeleton moves there

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
move like a human skeleton moves there
is<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> spool<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.810> allows<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> foot<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
is a spool in here that allows a foot to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.510 
is a spool in here that allows a foot to
go<00:00:33.059> into<00:00:33.300> dorsiflexion<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.230> plantar<00:00:35.160> flexion

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
go into dorsiflexion and plantar flexion

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
go into dorsiflexion and plantar flexion
that<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.180> can't<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.380> it's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that we can't do on this because it's

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
that we can't do on this because it's
stuck<00:00:37.739> together<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.300> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
stuck together but we don't have that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
stuck together but we don't have that
limitation<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.350> draw<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.399> have

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
limitation when we draw and when we have

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.500 
limitation when we draw and when we have
the<00:00:41.670> 3d<00:00:42.000> model<00:00:43.489> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.910> extended<00:00:45.660> foot<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
the 3d model this is an extended foot I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.340 
the 3d model this is an extended foot I
like<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> begin<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> rough<00:00:49.410> something<00:00:51.350> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
like to begin with a rough something to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.630 
like to begin with a rough something to
contain<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> proportions<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:56.100> okay<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
contain the proportions it's okay if you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
contain the proportions it's okay if you
take<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.059> time<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.250> but<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
take some time with that but to make it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
take some time with that but to make it
look<00:00:59.789> three-dimensional<00:01:00.180> even<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> do

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
look three-dimensional even when I do

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.680 
look three-dimensional even when I do
that<00:01:01.379> rough<00:01:01.680> something<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.340> thinking<00:01:02.690> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that rough something I'm thinking of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
that rough something I'm thinking of
height<00:01:04.019> width<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> depth<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.280> letter

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
height width and depth and we letter

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
height width and depth and we letter
those<00:01:05.760> systems<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.390> XY<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.530> Z<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:09.320> with<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
those systems as XY and Z and with just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.149 
those systems as XY and Z and with just
those<00:01:10.830> coordinates<00:01:12.260> we<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.530> build<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:16.159> lego

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
those coordinates we can build a lego

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
those coordinates we can build a lego
foot<00:01:19.400> standing<00:01:20.400> non<00:01:20.930> extended<00:01:23.000> which<00:01:24.000> even<00:01:24.330> if

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
foot standing non extended which even if

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.050 
foot standing non extended which even if
it<00:01:24.509> doesn't<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.020> foot<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:27.270> looks<00:01:27.540> 3d

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
it doesn't look like a foot it looks 3d

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
it doesn't look like a foot it looks 3d
then<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.329> put<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.810> cylinder<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.770> there

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
then when we put this cylinder in there

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.690 
then when we put this cylinder in there
it<00:01:32.340> runs<00:01:32.880> along<00:01:33.299> X<00:01:34.049> which<00:01:34.829> helps<00:01:35.189> us<00:01:35.280> draw<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it runs along X which helps us draw the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.289 
it runs along X which helps us draw the
ellipse<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.579> we<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
ellipse and we know that that is the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
ellipse and we know that that is the
fulcrum<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> foot<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.530> means<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
fulcrum of the foot that means it's the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.120 
fulcrum of the foot that means it's the
centre<00:01:41.460> axle<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.329> foots<00:01:42.659> rotation<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:44.009> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
centre axle of the foots rotation if I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.440 
centre axle of the foots rotation if I
draw<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> from<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:46.850> you'll<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.119> we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
draw it from the side you'll see that we

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.710 
draw it from the side you'll see that we
have<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.560> depth<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.610> Z<00:01:50.759> line<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
have the depth that's the Z line the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.410 
have the depth that's the Z line the
height<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.799> Y<00:01:52.979> line<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.270> we're

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
height that's the Y line and then we're

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.709 
height that's the Y line and then we're
looking<00:01:54.509> straight<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.320> X<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.719> ankle

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
looking straight down on X or that ankle

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.920 
looking straight down on X or that ankle
joint<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.969> when<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> foot<00:02:00.360> moves<00:02:00.659> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
joint is and when that foot moves on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.130 
joint is and when that foot moves on
that<00:02:01.079> hinge<00:02:01.320> joint<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.829> makes<00:02:02.189> an<00:02:02.340> arc<00:02:03.140> goes

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that hinge joint and makes an arc goes

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.900 
that hinge joint and makes an arc goes
into<00:02:04.380> extension<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.399> see<00:02:07.160> that<00:02:08.160> Z<00:02:08.580> will

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
into extension we can see that Z will

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.040 
into extension we can see that Z will
not<00:02:09.119> line<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.869> Z<00:02:10.400> it<00:02:11.400> will<00:02:11.580> aim<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.780> when

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
not line up on Z it will aim up so when

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.730 
not line up on Z it will aim up so when
we<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:14.960> refined<00:02:15.960> foot<00:02:16.320> I'm<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
we do this refined foot I'm going to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.620 
we do this refined foot I'm going to
chisel<00:02:17.550> some<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.880> plane<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.420> looks<00:02:18.570> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
chisel some of the plane so it looks a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.450 
chisel some of the plane so it looks a
little<00:02:18.840> bit<00:02:19.080> more<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> foot<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.280> all

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
little bit more like a foot it's not all

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.750 
little bit more like a foot it's not all
right<00:02:20.700> angles<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:23.010> big<00:02:23.130> foot<00:02:23.370> we'll<00:02:23.580> put

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
right angles and the big foot we'll put

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.490 
right angles and the big foot we'll put
into<00:02:23.910> an<00:02:24.090> extended<00:02:24.480> position<00:02:24.720> rather<00:02:25.200> than<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
into an extended position rather than a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.620 
into an extended position rather than a
straight<00:02:26.280> up-and-down<00:02:26.490> position<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.390> let's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
straight up-and-down position so let's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.480 
straight up-and-down position so let's
get<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.280> ankle<00:02:29.280> bones<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:30.330> would<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
get the ankle bones that would be the
