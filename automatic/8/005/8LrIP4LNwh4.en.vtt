00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519 
actual names of the songs are inside
that<00:00:20.130> file<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> told<00:00:21.359> him<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:21.600> mp3<00:00:22.080> tagged

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that file so I told him about mp3 tagged

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.800 
that file so I told him about mp3 tagged
because<00:00:22.650> mp3<00:00:23.160> tagged<00:00:23.340> works<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.880> WMA<00:00:24.510> files

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
because mp3 tagged works with WMA files

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529 
because mp3 tagged works with WMA files
and<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.590> transfer<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and it can transfer it can take the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.210 
and it can transfer it can take the
names<00:00:28.140> inside<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> phone

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
names inside it and make it the phone

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.270

name<00:00:29.429> only<00:00:30.859> he<00:00:31.859> were<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.669> change<00:00:33.090> them<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
name only he were to change them all to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.440 
name only he were to change them all to
WMA<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.670> they've<00:00:35.850> been<00:00:35.940> recovered<00:00:36.329> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
WMA because they've been recovered as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.950 
WMA because they've been recovered as
WMV<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.700> told<00:00:38.969> him<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> DOS<00:00:39.540> command<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.899> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
WMV so I told him a DOS command that you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.420 
WMV so I told him a DOS command that you
could<00:00:40.110> use<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.500> he<00:00:40.620> kept<00:00:40.829> getting<00:00:40.950> accessed

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
could use but he kept getting accessed

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.970 
could use but he kept getting accessed
annoyed<00:00:41.730> errors<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:43.050> once<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.649> told<00:00:43.829> him

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
annoyed errors and then once I told him

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.139 
annoyed errors and then once I told him
what<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:44.640> run<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.059> an

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
what to do which was run it as an

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.619 
what to do which was run it as an
administrator<00:00:46.160> he<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.760> mp3<00:00:48.210> tagged

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
administrator he then can use mp3 tagged

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
administrator he then can use mp3 tagged
because<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:48.989> come<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.410> access<00:00:49.860> denied

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
because they come up with access denied

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
because they come up with access denied
as<00:00:50.340> well<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.030> he<00:00:51.210> had<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> run<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> as

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
as well so he had to run that as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
at the startup and type in a command

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870 
at the startup and type in a command
prompt<00:01:45.710> now<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.860> isn't<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.250> own<00:01:47.399> personal

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
prompt now this isn't my own personal

tweak<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.210> found<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> internet<00:01:48.960> when

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
tweak I found this on the internet when

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
tweak I found this on the internet when
I<00:01:49.110> first<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.530> Windows<00:01:49.829> Vista<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.369> thought

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I first got Windows Vista so I thought

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.510 
I first got Windows Vista so I thought
I'd<00:01:50.610> share<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.360> share<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.399> can

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I'd share it to share with you you can

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
I'd share it to share with you you can
right-click<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.689> hit<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.049> time

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
right-click and then you hit this time

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.690 
right-click and then you hit this time
you<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> ironically<00:01:56.100> run<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.579> an

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you have to ironically run it as an

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
you have to ironically run it as an
administrator<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.540> then<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.170> comes<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.439> with

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
administrator so then it comes up with

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.190 
administrator so then it comes up with
the<00:01:58.680> user<00:01:58.829> account<00:01:59.159> control<00:01:59.450> continue<00:02:00.450> now

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the user account control continue now

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
the user account control continue now

are in a DOS box so what you need to do

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
are in a DOS box so what you need to do
is<00:02:04.079> basically<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> command<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
is basically this is the command to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
is basically this is the command to
enable<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> administrator<00:02:06.950> administrator

anymore<00:03:27.780> because<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.290> will<00:03:28.440> run<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.890> as

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
anymore because it will run it as

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.740
