the arrow like killing things with arrow
I<00:04:00.200> think<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.769> actually<00:04:01.040> does<00:04:01.220> work<00:04:01.370> by<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.640> way

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760

I think it's like if you throw this at
something<00:04:03.019> it's<00:04:03.140> an<00:04:03.230> instant<00:04:03.560> kill<00:04:03.650> because

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
something it's an instant kill because

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.199 
something it's an instant kill because
