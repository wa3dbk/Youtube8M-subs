00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello university morale personal sofa 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.869
 I'm organic this month's interview 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.260
 with josÃ© kafala use the junior announcement 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.689
 but he prefers to call June is not 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.730
 Okay, so we had an afternoon. 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 very useful with a field day of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.109
 production and processing of strawberries 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.690
 organic I enjoyed this is without being 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.840
 To make an interview with him right. 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 jonas is what the biological control of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.710
 pest insects and so what is the example 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 that you can give 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 biological control is when the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 people use other living organisms 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 to control certain beaches by 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.809
 useful strawberry example 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 biological control can be made from acr 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.800
 that the mite can be done 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.140
 with others here the predators 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.890
 food pest radio other cultures 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.229
 reasons why we have enemies 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.119
 natural flames for the doses that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.710
 develops within another girl of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.960
 eggs inside flooded 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.229
 So who killed these pest lizards? 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 the eggs there are the moths and we also have 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.600
 also inside told beautiful store is 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 pathogenic microorganisms are micro 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 galling fungi bacteria and viruses that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.159
 cause diseases and insects are applied 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.860
 organization and then they will do the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.830
 control of these pests also and with 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.479
 practical application of biological control 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.680
 in a system of organic production of 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.560
 foods 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 what is the advantage biological control is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.430
 that you do not have the problem of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 pest resistance from the fifth 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.710
 when you have an application named 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.520
 of products and touch can induce 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.399
 pest resistance 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 biological control it is one and has no 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.310
 no desire to succeed 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.800
 you have no problem resins 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.220
 cultures in the products in control 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.860
 also it can be done is is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 only with a black woman doing the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.630
 more suitable by increasing the amount of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.690
 natural enemies in the area then not 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.300
 It costs the smallest though who brings 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 still the study in the technological part 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.200
 following band is still advancing 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.430
 in brazil or brazil and mainly 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.799
 in Brazil, right? 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.320
 is very few studies in the form have a 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.810
 wave of studies well advanced here in 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.489
 Brazil it would be said that it is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.760
 crawling in this study sound 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.190
 We're not even gullible in Brazil. 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.930
 there are so many practical applications do not have 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.580
 much for the practical application we have 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.610
 some cultures 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.620
 is the strongest blow of sugar is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.780
 practically the control when it treated the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.480
 matter is made biological control not 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.460
 It's soy has also done a lot of things. 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.040
 biological control development of 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.120
 virus that causes the disease in the mills 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.240
 solid is now part of olericultura 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.090
 left 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.680
 little thing being done is not that the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.210
 with the country as the netherlands as spain 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.160
 still crawling we're still 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.300
 starting a job 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.600
 So that person is wanting 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.010
 start any organic production 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.350
 recommendation you give to that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.000
 person is wanting to get inside 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.070
 whether a biological control focus such as 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.750
 people do to increase the population of 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.970
 natural enemies near field 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.790
 the first thing but good practices 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.130
 the appropriate soil management of the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.550
 Water is mania in the bush 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.800
 the ground right in you 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.930
 the idea that you have to clean up 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.190
 the completely clean area is wrong and 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.890
 gauchos leave the strip of vegetation 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.690
 also saw Rene introduce 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.160
 plants that are beneficial to 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.690
 natural enemies , right? 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.760
 as we have here example that in the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.130
 area here everyone saw right 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.260
 so basically the way you 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.170
 will fatally favor enemies 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.990
 natural and will reduce to buy them 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.140
 junior beauty thank you very much for your 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.450
 contribution and why you like it 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.550
 this video of a gem below and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.050
 subscribe to the organic university channel 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.050
 ok see you soon
