offering that vibration absorption that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
offering that vibration absorption that
eventually<00:00:55.050> we'll<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.739> hands<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
eventually we'll get to your hands and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
eventually we'll get to your hands and
create<00:00:56.309> sort<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> numbness<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.629> really

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
create sort of that numbness you really

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.150 
create sort of that numbness you really
won't<00:00:57.930> find<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> defi<00:00:58.890> advanced

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
won't find that with the defi advanced

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
won't find that with the defi advanced
SL<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.760> soaks<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.270> those<00:01:00.480> vibrations

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
SL it really soaks up those vibrations

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
SL it really soaks up those vibrations
that<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.350> normally<00:01:01.710> kill<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.100> hands

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that would normally kill your hands

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.219 
that would normally kill your hands
really<00:01:02.879> shorten<00:01:03.300> your<00:01:03.420> ride<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:04.199> of

that<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:17.580> able<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.939> add<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.140> technology

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that we're able to add that technology

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.679 
that we're able to add that technology
while<00:01:19.830> still<00:01:20.159> lightening<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> frame<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
while still lightening the frame so this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
while still lightening the frame so this
is<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> lightest<00:01:22.470> rode<00:01:22.650> frame<00:01:22.890> we've<00:01:23.070> ever

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is the lightest rode frame we've ever

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
is the lightest rode frame we've ever
been<00:01:23.490> able<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> produce<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.810> we've<00:01:24.930> added

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
been able to produce but we've added

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
been able to produce but we've added
just<00:01:25.799> brake<00:01:26.009> technology<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just brake technology to it that's a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
just brake technology to it that's a
pretty<00:01:27.330> impressive<00:01:27.630> feature<00:01:28.110> best<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.040> both

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
pretty impressive feature best of both
