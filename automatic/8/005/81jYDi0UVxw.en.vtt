00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.110 
obviously I want to be satisfied with my
race<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.709> as<00:03:05.830> well<00:03:05.980> as<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:06.760> when<00:03:07.000> it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
race and do as well as I can but when it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.920 
race and do as well as I can but when it
comes<00:03:07.269> down<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.750> know<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> think

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
comes down to it you know I think

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.320 
comes down to it you know I think
everyone<00:03:08.350> goes<00:03:08.440> in<00:03:08.620> wanting<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.950> win<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.820> don't

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
everyone goes in wanting to win I don't

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.600 
everyone goes in wanting to win I don't
know<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> competitor<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.080> doesn't<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:12.430> yeah<00:03:12.580> I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
know a competitor that doesn't so yeah I

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.920 
know a competitor that doesn't so yeah I
think<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.120> would<00:03:13.239> be<00:03:13.390> I've<00:03:13.600> been<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
think it would be I've been on the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.240 
think it would be I've been on the
podium<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.260> couple<00:03:14.500> times<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.830> year<00:03:15.070> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
podium a couple times this year and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.979 
podium a couple times this year and
doing<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.580> at<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.760> Olympics<00:03:16.090> would<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.360> the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
doing it at the Olympics would be the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.130 
doing it at the Olympics would be the
icing<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.380> cake<00:03:17.470> for<00:03:18.100> sure
