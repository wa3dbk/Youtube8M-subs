00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
opportunity and it's square the new moon

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.540 
opportunity and it's square the new moon
is<00:04:34.960> squared<00:04:35.229> Jupiter<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.830> it's<00:04:36.069> square<00:04:36.310> pluto

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
is squared Jupiter and it's square pluto

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.529 
is squared Jupiter and it's square pluto
so<00:04:37.479> pluto<00:04:38.169> can<00:04:39.099> be<00:04:39.520> well<00:04:40.120> there's<00:04:40.300> things

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
so pluto can be well there's things

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.089 
so pluto can be well there's things

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
change but Pluto wants transformation

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.330
