self<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.020> feel<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> lot

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
self now this one does feel a lot

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.670 
self now this one does feel a lot
cheaper<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> very<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.360> small<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.350> it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
cheaper and is very very small so it's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
cheaper and is very very small so it's
probably<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> previous

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
probably not as good as the previous

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.920 
probably not as good as the previous
stands<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.400> again<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.030> never<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
stands but then again you never know we

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.390 
stands but then again you never know we
have<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> first<00:01:22.259> test<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> see

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
have to first test to an out and see

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.980 
have to first test to an out and see
what<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.060> does<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.810> little

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
what it can do does have these little

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
what it can do does have these little
vents<00:01:25.350> yeah<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.979> keep<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> cooler<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.970> suppose

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
vents yeah to keep it cooler I suppose

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510

you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.799> by<00:01:28.979> locking

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you know what they mean by locking

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
you know what they mean by locking
because<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> doesn't<00:01:30.150> seem<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.540> any<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
because it doesn't seem to be any way to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
because it doesn't seem to be any way to
lock<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.680> seems<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.270> grip

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
lock this seems have a pretty good grip

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.069 
lock this seems have a pretty good grip
on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> table<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
on the table this one will go like that

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
on the table this one will go like that
which<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> does

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
which is in like that like it does

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
which is in like that like it does
actually<00:01:39.119> stick<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.799> it
