seven<00:00:08.189> bearings<00:00:09.019> now<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> did<00:00:10.650> get<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.889> new<00:00:10.920> set

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
seven bearings now I did get a new set

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.620 
seven bearings now I did get a new set
of<00:00:11.370> these<00:00:11.550> these<00:00:11.790> RS<00:00:12.059> tf's

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
of these these RS tf's

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.740 
of these these RS tf's
and<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.290> 52<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.280> new<00:00:14.429> Shake<00:00:14.700> Junt<00:00:14.940> so

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
and a 52 and I do have new Shake Junt so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.269 
and a 52 and I do have new Shake Junt so
it<00:00:15.839> kind<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> tells<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.560> something<00:00:16.920> already

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
it kind of tells you something already

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.359 
it kind of tells you something already
that<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.789> them<00:00:17.940> again<00:00:18.890> I'm<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.070> using<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
that I got them again I'm just using the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.820 
that I got them again I'm just using the
iPhone<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.180> because<00:00:21.510> my<00:00:22.050> JBC<00:00:22.560> needs

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
iPhone for this because my JBC needs

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.849 
iPhone for this because my JBC needs
charged<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.109> well<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.500> could<00:00:25.680> just

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
charged and I was well you could just

you can check out my skate vids to see
how<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> skate<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.400> whatnot

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199

you know check them out and okay I'm
gonna<00:00:36.059> start<00:00:36.329> off<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.290> bearings<00:00:37.710> they

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
gonna start off with the bearings they

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.010 
gonna start off with the bearings they
are<00:00:38.850> very<00:00:39.649> very<00:00:40.649> nice<00:00:40.890> bearings<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:45.020> they

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
are very very nice bearings and they

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
are very very nice bearings and they
roll<00:00:46.260> great<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:47.460> spin<00:00:47.850> great<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.420> mean

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
roll great they spin great I mean

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.470 
roll great they spin great I mean
they're<00:00:49.170> they're<00:00:49.590> great<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> I'll<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.300> give

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
they're they're great and I'll just give

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.819 
they're they're great and I'll just give
it<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> spin<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:54.469> just

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.340 

that's<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.430> tiny<00:00:59.640> spin<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.840> I've

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that's just a little tiny spin and I've

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
that's just a little tiny spin and I've
scared<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:01.890> bearings<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.760> September<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
scared these bearings from September of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.820 
scared these bearings from September of
2011<00:01:04.610> until<00:01:05.610> June<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> 2012<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.560> actually

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
2011 until June of 2012 and I'm actually

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.760 
2011 until June of 2012 and I'm actually
probably<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:08.820> these<00:01:09.409> wills<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
probably gonna put these wills and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
probably gonna put these wills and
bearings<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.310> mini<00:01:11.490> board<00:01:12.409> that's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
bearings on my mini board that's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.760 
bearings on my mini board that's
probably<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
probably what I'm gonna do and the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
probably what I'm gonna do and the
bearings<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.340> handle<00:01:20.610> impact<00:01:21.000> very<00:01:21.360> good

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
bearings can handle impact very good

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.490 
bearings can handle impact very good
like<00:01:22.409> I've<00:01:22.590> done<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.659> six<00:01:24.659> foot<00:01:24.900> drop<00:01:25.229> with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
like I've done a six foot drop with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.760 
like I've done a six foot drop with
these<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.070> few<00:01:26.939> times<00:01:27.180> I've<00:01:27.630> done<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.259> 5<00:01:28.530> foot

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
these a few times I've done some 5 foot

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.749 
these a few times I've done some 5 foot
drops<00:01:29.100> I've<00:01:29.460> done<00:01:30.409> quite<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> few<00:01:31.650> drops<00:01:32.130> with

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
drops I've done quite a few drops with

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870 
drops I've done quite a few drops with
these<00:01:32.939> wills<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.630> stair<00:01:33.930> sets<00:01:34.880> repeatedly

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
these wills and stair sets repeatedly

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.630 
these wills and stair sets repeatedly
and<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:38.159> did<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.640> break<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.640> they

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and I did not break any of them they

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.630 
and I did not break any of them they
actually<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:42.090> wet<00:01:42.450> twice<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.350> water<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
actually got wet twice with water so I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.770 
actually got wet twice with water so I
just<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> baby

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
just put them in a little bit of baby

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.289 
just put them in a little bit of baby
oil<00:01:46.189> they're<00:01:47.189> fine<00:01:47.549> they're<00:01:47.960> they're<00:01:48.960> great

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
oil they're fine they're they're great

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
oil they're fine they're they're great
they<00:01:51.299> hold<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:55.310> they're<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
they hold up very good and they're the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.899 
they hold up very good and they're the
best<00:01:56.640> bearings<00:01:57.119> I've<00:01:57.270> had<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.659> far

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
best bearings I've had so far

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
best bearings I've had so far
they're<00:01:59.909> completely<00:02:00.360> amazing<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.409> going

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
they're completely amazing now I'm going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
they're completely amazing now I'm going
to<00:02:04.619> talk<00:02:04.740> about<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.640> bones<00:02:05.880> stf

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
to talk about the will the bones stf

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.499 
to talk about the will the bones stf
will<00:02:07.079> these<00:02:07.350> wills<00:02:07.680> were<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.399> 51<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> got

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
will these wills were a 51 when I got

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.750 
will these wills were a 51 when I got
I'm<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:09.929> thing<00:02:10.020> I've<00:02:10.289> noticed<00:02:10.760> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
I'm the only thing I've noticed that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.850 
I'm the only thing I've noticed that
could<00:02:12.209> possibly<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.930> negative<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
could possibly be negative is that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
could possibly be negative is that
we're<00:02:14.130> down<00:02:14.340> really<00:02:14.790> fast<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.240> also<00:02:15.510> depends

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
we're down really fast but also depends

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.270 
we're down really fast but also depends
on<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.050> surface<00:02:16.410> you're<00:02:16.560> skating<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.040> how

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
on what surface you're skating on how

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.420 
on what surface you're skating on how
often<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.700> skate<00:02:18.090> me<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> skate<00:02:19.530> quite<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.190> bit

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
often you skate me I skate quite a bit

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.200 
often you skate me I skate quite a bit
on<00:02:20.960> my<00:02:21.960> driveway<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.650> not<00:02:23.370> real<00:02:23.670> rough<00:02:23.970> but

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
on my driveway is not real rough but

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.140 
on my driveway is not real rough but
it's<00:02:24.330> also<00:02:24.450> not<00:02:24.720> real<00:02:24.900> smooth<00:02:25.290> either<00:02:26.150> because

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
it's also not real smooth either because

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.250 
it's also not real smooth either because
that's<00:02:27.300> usually<00:02:27.450> where<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> skate<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:30.260> they

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that's usually where I skate at and they

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.390 
that's usually where I skate at and they
got<00:02:31.410> pretty<00:02:31.620> small<00:02:31.890> they're<00:02:32.070> probably<00:02:32.220> about

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
got pretty small they're probably about

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.240 
got pretty small they're probably about
40<00:02:33.350> something<00:02:34.350> millimeter<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.100> they're

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
40 something millimeter now they're

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.350 
40 something millimeter now they're
probably<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.670> 40<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.900> 42<00:02:37.320> maybe<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.250> 41<00:02:38.959> and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
probably like a 40 or 42 maybe a 41 and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.790 
probably like a 40 or 42 maybe a 41 and
now<00:02:42.360> oh<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:43.050> are<00:02:43.170> things<00:02:43.320> about<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> will

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
now oh there are things about the will

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.970 
now oh there are things about the will
is<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:44.220> positive<00:02:44.550> did<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.570> get<00:02:45.930> any<00:02:46.230> flat

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
is all positive did not get any flat

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.270 
is all positive did not get any flat
spots<00:02:47.370> whatsoever<00:02:48.320> other<00:02:49.320> rules<00:02:49.650> i've<00:02:49.830> had<00:02:50.040> i

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
spots whatsoever other rules i've had i

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.199 
spots whatsoever other rules i've had i
usually<00:02:50.970> flat<00:02:51.240> spot<00:02:51.570> them<00:02:51.780> doing<00:02:51.959> tail<00:02:52.260> slides

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
usually flat spot them doing tail slides

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.090 
usually flat spot them doing tail slides
because<00:02:54.209> i<00:02:54.360> do<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.570> lot<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.870> tail<00:02:55.170> slides<00:02:55.530> it's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
because i do a lot of tail slides it's

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.800 
because i do a lot of tail slides it's
probably<00:02:56.700> my<00:02:56.940> favorite<00:02:57.120> slide<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
probably my favorite slide is a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.720 
probably my favorite slide is a
frontside<00:02:58.230> tailslide<00:02:58.820> and<00:03:00.440> i<00:03:01.440> would<00:03:01.860> my<00:03:02.459> flat

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
frontside tailslide and i would my flat

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240 
frontside tailslide and i would my flat
spot<00:03:03.000> flat<00:03:03.780> spot<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> few<00:03:04.350> set<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> wheels<00:03:04.800> doing

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
spot flat spot a few set of wheels doing

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.050 
spot flat spot a few set of wheels doing
that<00:03:06.140> power<00:03:07.140> slotted<00:03:07.709> these<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.190> crazy<00:03:08.489> like

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
that power slotted these like crazy like

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.780 
that power slotted these like crazy like
when<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.300> was<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.480> senior<00:03:09.870> trip<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:11.610> was

when I was on senior trip and I was

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
when I was on senior trip and I was
skating<00:03:12.030> over<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.690> uh<00:03:14.989> I'm<00:03:15.989> having<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.290> brain

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
skating over and uh I'm having a brain

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.470 
skating over and uh I'm having a brain
fart<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.800> it's<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.190> Tennessee<00:03:17.640> pitching

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
fart here it's in Tennessee pitching

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.140 
fart here it's in Tennessee pitching
forward<00:03:18.690> yes<00:03:19.370> there's<00:03:20.370> there<00:03:20.880> was<00:03:20.910> some

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
forward yes there's there was some

vids I was doing some good powers I only

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.090 
vids I was doing some good powers I only
got<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.570> few<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:34.110> camera<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:34.769> I've<00:03:34.890> done

got like a few on camera but I've done

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.729 
got like a few on camera but I've done
longer<00:03:35.580> ones<00:03:35.930> than<00:03:36.930> what<00:03:37.110> you'll<00:03:37.260> see<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.560> that

vid and did not flat spot whatsoever

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.120 
vid and did not flat spot whatsoever
it's<00:03:43.290> amazing<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:45.709> also<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.830> nice<00:03:46.980> thing

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
it's amazing and also the nice thing

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.320 
it's amazing and also the nice thing
about<00:03:47.190> them<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:48.450> they<00:03:48.570> rule<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.230> nice<00:03:50.330> but

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
about them is that they rule so nice but

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.030 
about them is that they rule so nice but
when<00:03:51.510> they<00:03:51.630> do<00:03:51.690> get<00:03:51.989> small<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.560> like<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:52.830> size

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
when they do get small to like this size

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.210 
when they do get small to like this size
they<00:03:53.280> do<00:03:53.340> get<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.850> small<00:03:54.299> will<00:03:54.690> roll<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.860> mean

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
they do get that small will roll I mean

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.380 
they do get that small will roll I mean
like<00:03:56.370> don't<00:03:56.549> get<00:03:56.640> me<00:03:56.700> wrong<00:03:56.760> they'd<00:03:57.030> still

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
like don't get me wrong they'd still

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.900 
like don't get me wrong they'd still
roll<00:03:57.660> beastly<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:59.040> they<00:03:59.160> get<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.430> small

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
roll beastly but they get that small

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.509 
roll beastly but they get that small
will<00:04:00.239> drag<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:02.250> every<00:04:02.549> small<00:04:02.610> will<00:04:03.180> gets<00:04:04.489> and

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.770 

but<00:04:08.519> something<00:04:08.820> really<00:04:08.940> nice<00:04:09.180> does<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.660> they

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
but something really nice does that they

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.289 
but something really nice does that they
slide<00:04:10.200> when<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.190> want<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.790> they<00:04:11.850> grip<00:04:12.120> when

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
slide when I want to and they grip when

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.180 
slide when I want to and they grip when
I<00:04:12.329> want<00:04:12.570> them<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.680> perfect<00:04:13.920> balance

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
I want them to it's the perfect balance

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.270 
I want them to it's the perfect balance
of<00:04:14.459> hardness<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.150> slide<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.079> grip<00:04:16.350> they're

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
of hardness of slide and grip they're

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.740 
of hardness of slide and grip they're
83-b<00:04:19.519> gyro<00:04:20.519> meter<00:04:20.760> which<00:04:21.150> comes<00:04:21.390> out<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.570> be

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
83-b gyro meter which comes out to be

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.710 
83-b gyro meter which comes out to be
like<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> chart<00:04:23.310> well<00:04:23.580> after<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
like a on the a chart well after on the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.000 
like a on the a chart well after on the
a<00:04:24.750> chart<00:04:25.289> after<00:04:25.740> it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
a chart after it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.830 
a chart after it
100a<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:27.270> gets<00:04:27.480> very<00:04:27.840> inconsistent<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:30.240> you

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
100a it gets very inconsistent so you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.170 
100a it gets very inconsistent so you
need<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.140> B<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:32.070> if<00:04:32.160> it's<00:04:32.310> over<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> hundred<00:04:32.760> a

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
need the B for if it's over a hundred a

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.200 
need the B for if it's over a hundred a
it<00:04:33.600> comes<00:04:33.780> out<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.290> be<00:04:34.350> like<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.100> think<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.180> a

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
it comes out to be like I think on the a

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.870 
it comes out to be like I think on the a
chart<00:04:36.630> somewhere<00:04:37.170> between<00:04:38.510> 103<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.660> 105<00:04:40.880> but

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
chart somewhere between 103 and 105 but
