perspective<00:01:13.200> today<00:01:19.100> like<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.189> said<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
perspective today like I said with the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
perspective today like I said with the
racing<00:01:21.060> stuff<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.080> mesh<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
racing stuff it's got the mesh in the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
racing stuff it's got the mesh in the
window<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> looks<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:23.909> used<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
window so it looks like they used a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
window so it looks like they used a
racing<00:01:24.810> casting<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.830> made<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
racing casting and just made it a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.499 
racing casting and just made it a
highway<00:01:26.549> patrol<00:01:26.970> car<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.979> bad<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.670> think

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
highway patrol car so not bad I think

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.870

thought that'd be fun because the green

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.980 
thought that'd be fun because the green
is<00:05:21.750> burned<00:05:22.440> out<00:05:22.740> I've<00:05:23.490> just<00:05:23.700> got<00:05:23.880> red<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.330> blue
