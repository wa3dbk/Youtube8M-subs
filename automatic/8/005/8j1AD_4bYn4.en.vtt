 l 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
 London 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.449
 to be continued 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.279
 in its beginnings in formula 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.240
 it makes me think the friendly 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.880
 a big concession from a big marion to turin I was always in 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.260
 because you had rabies to say a little to the old-fashioned 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.100
 so here you go 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.960
 it's the lot of 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.250
 earle thing it reminds me a bit of my youth not in the same spirit 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.870
 if I had a family of to be so his wife such as the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 him and that the match s to death after the little of all this is eaten 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.800
 no lessons of always 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.090
 I always liked that 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.510
 the garage the car the thing 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.080
 a patient 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.110
 I've never had 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.760
 to satiate young people because that's it 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.190
 to make blows for families it's 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.610
 to really have more money to face 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 so for me it's not possible 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.020
 es2 then 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.100
 but here at genk 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 i know i do not have a lot of fun i'm not someone who wants 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.350
 which is very extravagant but I love alone in the car sports car 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 in a scene I'm having fun now 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.210
 between looters 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.890
 the bill 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.050
 I will play frankly if I had had there 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.560
 lucky to be able to and took part in tea where to go I 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 think that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.720
 the purpose of the game is the headscarf comfortable in the car 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.550
 you have to be well installed 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.760
 to be able to move on the track 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.819
 cook the trajectory is possible trajectory we will rework the look 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.449
 we put some blocks on the track and the goal of the game will be loved to go 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.529
 highest possible 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.359
 and the arrival to anticipate its trajectory 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.219
 we have to be in the bend already too late 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.829
 everything will be played before the turn 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.219
 so you have to work this riding look to increase the pace 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.430
 henriette status to understand steering automatisms by didier 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.239
 to reach 560 kilos 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.299
 150 shows 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.629
 so that's what's interesting 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.249
 a very unusual motorcycle engine 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.399
 the peculiarity of engine at the front 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.669
 it is a propulsion 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 the most important what i think and julia asked side 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.459
 as I do not know the music you do not know well the trajectories 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.049
 for volleyball standing against this text 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.529
 another thing 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.819
 alas the police cars to arrive in the future 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
 it makes noise is a good barometer to be stronger 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.469
 at 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.089
 it attracts a lot of eyes from the one where you answer his cell 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.669
 that's what we do and we'll say better 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.249
 cars like sacred 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.469
 who would pay for really 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.469
 good idea great feeling I enjoyed 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.509
 very soon we will have we reject it to score 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.330
 it's magic 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.639
 that's something not made the effort to learn that 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.750
 and there we have not at all at all it starts to know anyway 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:45.780
 rouette they are right and for that we go just before the tank 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.879
 the popular uprising the words of the lot 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.740
 but for the extraordinary to wait for them a little 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.339
 in the area he wanted to leave 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.550
 on the seven novels one can not promise 162 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.980
 these two cases probably this time that are welcome 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.499
 for angola before the back permanently questioned 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.669
 opposite that 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.729
 these buses what to predict a loan on roulette 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.619
 two horses 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:15.259
 the fleet thing 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.650
 extraordinary 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.060
 believe that the monster
