00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
damage but it really it gets to being a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.180 
damage but it really it gets to being a
lot<00:02:16.540> after<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> while

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.330 

so<00:02:25.820> not<00:02:26.000> really<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.270> high<00:02:26.480> dps<00:02:26.990> fight<00:02:27.340> because

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
so not really a high dps fight because

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.390 
so not really a high dps fight because
of<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.550> fact<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:31.430> some<00:02:34.840> such<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.400> you

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
of the fact that it's some such a you

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.770 

if<00:05:16.920> you're<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.370> this<00:05:17.520> encounter<00:05:18.270> and

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
if you're in this encounter and

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.870 
if you're in this encounter and
somebody's<00:05:19.440> not<00:05:19.680> doing<00:05:19.980> that<00:05:20.010> grade<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.460> DPS

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
somebody's not doing that grade of DPS

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.270 
somebody's not doing that grade of DPS
don't<00:05:21.210> worry<00:05:21.420> about<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.810> because<00:05:22.080> in<00:05:22.320> all

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
don't worry about it because in all

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.900 
don't worry about it because in all
reality<00:05:23.520> it's<00:05:24.030> not<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.390> high<00:05:24.630> DPS<00:05:25.170> fight<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:26.790> be

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
reality it's not a high DPS fight to be

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.290 
reality it's not a high DPS fight to be
honest<00:05:28.340> so<00:05:29.340> if<00:05:29.460> somebody's<00:05:29.820> not<00:05:29.850> doing

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
honest so if somebody's not doing

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.830 
honest so if somebody's not doing
particularly<00:05:31.140> well<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.620> their<00:05:31.920> dps<00:05:32.280> charts

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
particularly well on their dps charts

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.250 
particularly well on their dps charts
don't<00:05:33.840> really<00:05:34.050> worry<00:05:34.260> about<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:36.110> because<00:05:37.110> the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
don't really worry about it because the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.220 
don't really worry about it because the
main<00:05:37.440> part<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.770> this<00:05:37.890> is<00:05:38.100> survivability<00:05:39.230> which

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
main part of this is survivability which

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.660 
main part of this is survivability which
I<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:41.960> guess<00:05:42.960> I've<00:05:43.110> got<00:05:43.230> a<00:05:43.260> bit<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.620> singers<00:05:44.490> on

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
I I guess I've got a bit of singers on

00:05:44.670 --> 00:06:10.129 
I I guess I've got a bit of singers on
well<00:05:45.630> geared<00:05:45.960> for<00:05:46.170> this

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.200 

as<00:06:11.139> you<00:06:11.350> see<00:06:11.560> here<00:06:11.770> nobody's<00:06:12.190> dpsing<00:06:12.669> my<00:06:12.910> spike

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
as you see here nobody's dpsing my spike

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:41.629 
as you see here nobody's dpsing my spike
really<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.979> that's<00:06:15.130> not<00:06:15.460> that<00:06:15.699> good

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.640 

as<00:06:42.210> you<00:06:42.360> see<00:06:42.539> here<00:06:42.780> I've<00:06:42.870> gotta<00:06:43.050> grow<00:06:43.379> which<00:06:43.530> is

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
as you see here I've gotta grow which is

00:06:43.650 --> 00:07:25.270 
as you see here I've gotta grow which is
not<00:06:43.800> good<00:06:44.009> at<00:06:44.909> all<00:06:44.969> to<00:06:45.780> be<00:06:45.810> honest

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.020 

so<00:07:25.970> we're<00:07:26.150> just<00:07:26.180> going<00:07:26.420> to<00:07:26.480> finish<00:07:26.660> this<00:07:26.810> up<00:07:27.170> a

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
so we're just going to finish this up a

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.460 
so we're just going to finish this up a
five<00:07:29.030> percent<00:07:29.389> just<00:07:29.810> go<00:07:29.930> on<00:07:30.020> down<00:07:30.050> fairly

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
five percent just go on down fairly

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.650 
five percent just go on down fairly
quick<00:07:30.800> and<00:07:31.100> I<00:07:31.820> think<00:07:32.150> this<00:07:32.270> is<00:07:32.360> gonna<00:07:32.450> be<00:07:32.570> the

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 
quick and I think this is gonna be the

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.050 
quick and I think this is gonna be the
fight<00:07:33.970> so<00:07:34.970> I<00:07:35.000> hope<00:07:35.180> you<00:07:35.389> enjoyed<00:07:35.960> it<00:07:35.990> and

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:39.889 
hopefully I'll be able to finish these

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:51.220 
hopefully I'll be able to finish these
