as<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:08.770> is<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.040> great<00:03:09.250> way<00:03:09.489> to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
as well this is a great way to

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.050 
as well this is a great way to
incorporate<00:03:10.000> some<00:03:10.540> protein<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.370> CSI<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.430> um

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
incorporate some protein and CSI you um

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.670

I<00:03:14.050> don't<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:16.170> didn't<00:03:17.170> get<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.470> much<00:03:17.650> of

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
I don't know I didn't get it much of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.520 
I don't know I didn't get it much of
this<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.030> probably<00:03:19.330> less<00:03:19.510> than<00:03:19.570> like<00:03:19.959> 200

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
this so it's probably less than like 200

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.050 
this so it's probably less than like 200
calories<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.250> don't<00:03:21.400> think<00:03:21.610> if<00:03:21.730> I'm<00:03:21.850> eat

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
calories and I don't think if I'm eat

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.250 
calories and I don't think if I'm eat
all<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.820> really<00:03:25.660> don't<00:03:26.020> it's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
all this I really I really don't it's

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.840 
all this I really I really don't it's
like<00:03:27.450> hmm

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
like hmm

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.310 
like hmm
but<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.000> pretty<00:03:31.360> good<00:03:31.570> there's<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.930> different

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
but it's pretty good there's a different

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.530 
but it's pretty good there's a different
taste<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.709> live<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.160> just<00:03:33.700> keep<00:03:34.030> reminding<00:03:34.150> me

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
taste to live I just keep reminding me

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.600 
taste to live I just keep reminding me
of<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.720> righteous<00:03:35.170> retreat<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.040> liquidy

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
of a righteous retreat like a liquidy
