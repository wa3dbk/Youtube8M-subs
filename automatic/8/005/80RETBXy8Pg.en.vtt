articulation<00:03:39.590> why<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.129> thing<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.659> really

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
articulation why is this thing is really

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.300 
articulation why is this thing is really
really<00:03:42.019> good<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:42.949> it<00:03:43.430> does<00:03:43.639> hindered<00:03:44.299> by<00:03:44.510> this

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
really good but it does hindered by this

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.189 
really good but it does hindered by this
jacket<00:03:46.310> here<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:46.940> that's<00:03:47.239> why<00:03:47.389> you<00:03:47.989> can't

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199
