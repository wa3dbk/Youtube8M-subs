version of the wave okay let's just see
here<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.640> also<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.000> similar<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.470> apart

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
here it's also very similar and apart

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.760 
here it's also very similar and apart
from<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> fact<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:33.090> has<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.770> TDR

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

only ok so looks like a cheap version of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.440 
only ok so looks like a cheap version of
the<00:01:38.189> wave<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.740> Stella's<00:01:40.740> good<00:01:40.950> quality
