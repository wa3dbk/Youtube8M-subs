which<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:05.930> it's<00:00:06.930> identical<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.799> first<00:00:08.040> one

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
which is it's identical to the first one

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.779 
which is it's identical to the first one
the<00:00:10.460> only<00:00:11.460> difference<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:14.839> this<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.049> here

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
the only difference is this one here

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.670 
the only difference is this one here
there<00:00:17.789> aren't<00:00:18.000> enough<00:00:18.060> switch<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.260> pretty

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
there aren't enough switch it's pretty

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.220 
there aren't enough switch it's pretty
much<00:00:20.420> easy<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.750> access<00:00:22.250> see<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.850> there

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
much easy to access see that right there

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.800 
much easy to access see that right there
so<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.609> struggle<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.330> turn<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> on

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so I have I don't struggle to turn it on

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.519 
so I have I don't struggle to turn it on
and<00:00:27.960> off<00:00:28.429> it's<00:00:29.429> off<00:00:29.640> its<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.660> okay<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and off it's off its back on okay and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.970 
and off it's off its back on okay and
then<00:00:31.740> there's<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.160> extra<00:00:32.610> plug<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:34.079> let's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
then there's an extra plug in here let's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
then there's an extra plug in here let's
say<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.370> you're<00:00:35.489> gonna<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.510> find

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
say if you're gonna use it you can find

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.950 
say if you're gonna use it you can find
an<00:00:37.020> adapter<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> plug<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:39.030> cable

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
an adapter and you can plug that cable

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.510 
an adapter and you can plug that cable
in<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.290> you'd<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.590> able<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.950> connect<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
in here you'd be able to connect it to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
in here you'd be able to connect it to
another<00:00:41.700> cut<00:00:42.000> another<00:00:42.300> camera<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.770> have

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
another cut another camera if you have

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.299 
another cut another camera if you have
another<00:00:44.160> camera<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.390> adapter

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
another camera with a different adapter

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.700 
another camera with a different adapter
okay<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.780> other<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> same

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
okay and other than that it's the same

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.580 
okay and other than that it's the same
layout<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:51.539> pin<00:00:51.780> setting<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.620> bit

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
layout the pin setting is a little bit

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.220 
layout the pin setting is a little bit
both<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.190> set<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> same<00:00:57.230> pin

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
both of these are set the same pin

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.619 
both of these are set the same pin
settings<00:00:58.680> dip<00:00:59.399> switch<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
settings dip switch so I can use this

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
settings dip switch so I can use this
remote<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:02.039> switch<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.760> remote<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.790> here

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
remote to switch to this remote and here

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.750 
remote to switch to this remote and here
we<00:01:05.850> go

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.900 

and<00:01:10.880> less<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:14.150> less<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.810> have<00:01:14.870> to<00:01:15.050> change<00:01:15.910> the

the switch the dip switch between these

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.900 
the switch the dip switch between these
two<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.710> these<00:01:21.950> two<00:01:22.010> okay<00:01:23.800> so<00:01:24.800> why<00:01:25.250> don't<00:01:25.310> I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.650 
Ellison yes what's going on here so I
mean<00:02:34.160> if<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.180> look<00:02:35.360> at<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.660> it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
mean if you look at it it's a it's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.420 
mean if you look at it it's a it's
nothing<00:02:38.959> but<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.140> tower<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.130> steel

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
nothing but a tower but that is steel

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.930 
nothing but a tower but that is steel
and<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:41.390> while<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.590> air<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.790> your

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
and then while in the air you have your

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.680 
and then while in the air you have your
FM<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.750> AM<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.220> your<00:02:46.670> cellphone<00:02:47.180> towers

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
FM and AM and and your cellphone towers

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.890 
FM and AM and and your cellphone towers
and<00:02:47.840> all<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.110> stuff<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.680> was<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:49.040> lot<00:02:49.280> of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
and all that stuff so it was a lot of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.510 
and all that stuff so it was a lot of
frequency<00:02:50.900> high<00:02:51.320> frequency<00:02:51.350> all<00:02:52.100> over<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
frequency high frequency all over the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.520 
frequency high frequency all over the
map<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:53.720> why<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:53.989> probably<00:02:54.260> was

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
map that's why I probably was

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.870 
map that's why I probably was
interfering<00:02:55.190> with<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:56.180> unit<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.640> that's

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
interfering with this unit and so that's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.600 
interfering with this unit and so that's
why<00:02:59.650> that's<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.709> only<00:03:00.920> time<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.160> had<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> problem

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
why that's the only time I had a problem

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.420 
why that's the only time I had a problem
with<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:03.230> then<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> think<00:03:03.620> because<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.400> was

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
with it and then I think because I was

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.960 
with it and then I think because I was
on<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.970> tower<00:03:05.470> with<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.500> lot<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.860> frequency<00:03:07.430> all

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
on the tower with a lot of frequency all

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.059 
on the tower with a lot of frequency all
over<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.420> place<00:03:08.630> that's<00:03:09.020> what<00:03:09.200> causes<00:03:09.500> it

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
over the place that's what causes it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.179 
over the place that's what causes it
not<00:03:10.189> to<00:03:10.310> work<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.900> uninvited<00:03:12.469> works<00:03:12.650> fine<00:03:12.950> if

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
not to work but uninvited works fine if

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.379 
not to work but uninvited works fine if
you<00:03:13.519> want<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.909> buy<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:15.019> model<00:03:15.469> I<00:03:16.389> recommend
