00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.130
 game with cornflower second frame 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.240
 Syrian 2 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.350
 as well as 4 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.180
 the game and 6 now mostly play 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:30.000
 Such are the options for a Queen's Gambit 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:33.080
 like the classic construction love to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.489
 there are fewer options to study 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.870
 although I confess that you still need a lot 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.480
 Why study here I play such a scheme 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.250
 simple b6 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.080
 not always but particularly like that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.019
 stop in what pluses simply arrange 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.019
 According to the plan, the knight's figure is set to 7 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.339
 spend c5 sound stati he does not hit 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.070
 on d5 you can take us for 4 already 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:08.280
 and even on f3 take spoil the structure 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 not sure how good it is but not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 sure so check it all the same it's not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.540
 very strong weakening of this case 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.299
 My elephant can be povesomee creation 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.630
 I am sure that is direct super choosing for me 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:32.280
 exchange is a queen mind eyes for 7 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.679
 there would be 7 valid or other fields 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.939
 all cd can be played on the whole pool 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:44.369
 about 11 8 you must skip at least 2 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.560
 Lada 38 grams in a simple rule 28 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.520
 cons there after queen 4 can it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.740
 point 6 sag play a6 to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.740
 be able to play the start of the 5 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 4 namely there will be like a 6 tail 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.549
 some on occasion so here he is to her 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.079
 four can swap safely I don't think 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.380
 what is it straight strong pawn center for 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.819
 him pawns doubled still chestnut up 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.409
 5 I want to play the tricky hour so over 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:22.060
 think how to prevent this horse 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:22.599
 f6 to play is necessary to have a single 5 5 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.560
 simply 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:32.709
 Well, you need to bow to the horse 5 will choose so he 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.049
 wants to 5 still play the principle 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.180
 wants it right but wants new little 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:44.950
 get tons then the queen b3 problem is stubborn 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.909
 in his intention well done right what 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.849
 persists Brolin is that we also do not 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.599
 born yesterday though no time has come 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.919
 accelerate 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:01.269
 He wants to spend that hard again 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:07.480
 do something we let him spend it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:14.260
 plan for 4 ha I would have 5 we have a game 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:19.150
 here again we fail the pawns on queen 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:25.389
 flank so he up to 5 can play it seems 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.970
 so unpleasant oh oh what did that let u 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.299
 there are more blows to me here 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.329
 the bundle will be dead urgently needed 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.530
 point to 4 lean heavily urgently think 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.299
 water up to 70 play water 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:44.290
 cd8 well, either 4 need to think of alternatives 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.000
 there is a principle points 5s is very important this 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.629
 breakthrough to 5 around him will be all now 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.349
 spinning well or in 45 another plan for 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:58.520
 whites are waiting for me to play d4c 3 and here 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:07.000
 pawns are pulled down and so 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:12.370
 Vernayak something with a connection he was gone 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.209
 with we on 2 him peppers b4 he 's uncle everything 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.840
 Well done to 8, the game is simple, you need 5 I take 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.760
 100,000 times in a row 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.010
 it seems the bundle will be very unpleasant and 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.380
 we as an alternative to the shale 5 play on 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:33.160
 d5 to the right of the wedge to 6 very top will 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.040
 so difficult choice is unpleasant but still 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.860
 up to 5 I think it's worth playing 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:50.140
 I probably still proview risky 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:55.210
 is it really risky for me I won't hit 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:05:01.720
 I will beat there with a dead knot 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:05.110
 just 5 sun is always necessary just for 6 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.210
 4 principle just playing on foot to 6 she 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.130
 further until the opponentâ€™s time 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.660
 out with the connection maybe not 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.660
 lucky so time I had less 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.990
 So 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.610
 a little log compensation will wait here 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:34.440
 server 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:36.330
 can you come back well if not 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.020
 back then this is his problem 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:44.430
 it is solely therefore important to have 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:51.870
 good internet when playing on the internet 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:56.430
 actually this friends finish 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.100
 This video lesson from it you could in 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.950
 principle what to understand now all the time 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.980
 it turned out he was awarded the victory so 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.180
 here it can be understood firstly 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.710
 good placement for black queen 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.120
 gambite take arrangement very 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:20.310
 simple can i use when conditionally 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.840
 same 5 goes root to 7 rises elephant through 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.850
 b6 develops on b7 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.960
 but this arrangement is basically 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.320
 white buzues started on 5 black beat the food and 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.890
 then something like this to continue Heart 2 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.700
 5 black babies are played then 8 babies 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:42.050
 2 and 8 dead 4 and so simple 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.729
 arrangement and what are its advantages in that 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.190
 may be less you explore options already 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:51.720
 roughly have a game plan 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:55.100
 so in the case of the queen acre gambit you 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.590
 do not play with 6 Abela developed it is also 5 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.180
 just play this a6 setup 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.530
 it is also useful and the inclusion somewhere on 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:07.740
 options affect your favor 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:10.229
