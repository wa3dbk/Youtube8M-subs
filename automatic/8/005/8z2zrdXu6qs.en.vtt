00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.060 
love my nikon 24 to 7 f 2.8 lens now
this<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.880> an<00:00:21.000> f/4<00:00:21.510> lens<00:00:21.619> but<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> high

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
this is an f/4 lens but with the high

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.790 
this is an f/4 lens but with the high
ISO<00:00:23.640> capabilities<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.779> camera<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.350> with

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
ISO capabilities of this camera and with

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.089 
ISO capabilities of this camera and with
the<00:00:25.949> steady<00:00:26.160> shot<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.810> f/4<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> good

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the steady shot I think f/4 is a good

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.089 
the steady shot I think f/4 is a good
compromise<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.150> make<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.510> lens<00:00:31.109> smaller<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
compromise to make this lens smaller and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
compromise to make this lens smaller and
lighter<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.550> half<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.910> weight<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
lighter it's half the weight of the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.430 
lighter it's half the weight of the
nikon<00:00:34.440> lens<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.059> i'm<00:00:36.059> very<00:00:36.540> pleased<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
in between pictures of sharp

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
in between pictures of sharp
distortion<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.730> much<00:00:47.940> under<00:00:48.149> control

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
distortion is very much under control

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it's going to live on this camera the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.400 
it's going to live on this camera the
the<00:00:55.800> whole<00:00:55.949> package<00:00:56.489> balances<00:00:57.180> well<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.170> zoom

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the whole package balances well the zoom

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
the whole package balances well the zoom
ring<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.039> buttery<00:00:59.910> smooth<00:01:00.359> people<00:01:00.809> have

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
ring is just buttery smooth people have

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
ring is just buttery smooth people have
asked<00:01:01.230> me<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> zoom<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.430> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
asked me about the zoom and it's just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.750 
asked me about the zoom and it's just
buttery<00:01:03.059> smooth<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.199> I'm

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
buttery smooth there you see I'm

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.719 
buttery smooth there you see I'm
activating<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:07.590> doesn't<00:01:08.340> creep

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
activating it there and it doesn't creep

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.320 
activating it there and it doesn't creep
it<00:01:09.150> stays<00:01:09.869> where<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.330> everything

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it stays where you put it everything

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
it stays where you put it everything
about<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.840> lens<00:01:13.110> seems<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:14.010> extremely

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
about this lens seems to be extremely

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.469 
about this lens seems to be extremely
high<00:01:15.150> quality<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.530> weather<00:01:17.009> sealed<00:01:17.479> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
high quality it is weather sealed so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.080 
high quality it is weather sealed so
hopefully<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.229> won't<00:01:19.409> let<00:01:19.740> much<00:01:20.009> dust<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.820> when

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hopefully it won't let much dust in when

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210 
hopefully it won't let much dust in when
you're<00:01:21.240> zooming<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:21.960> some<00:01:22.740> cheaper

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you're zooming in and out some cheaper

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.950 
you're zooming in and out some cheaper
zoom<00:01:23.460> lenses<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.060> zooming<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.750> they

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
zoom lenses you zooming in and out they

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.539 
zoom lenses you zooming in and out they
act<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> vacuum<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.040> pull<00:01:26.280> dust

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
act like a vacuum and they pull dust

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
act like a vacuum and they pull dust
right<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.000> hopefully<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> won't<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
right in hopefully that won't be a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
right in hopefully that won't be a
problem<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> I'm<00:01:30.780> really
