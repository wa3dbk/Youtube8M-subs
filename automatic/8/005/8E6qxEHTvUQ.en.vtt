00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.529
 another deck opening of fresh blood 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.250
 yes, I've had a treat again and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.929
 Although a gates on there other world 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 it's a bit older 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 but I thought it was right 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 play strong so i had had at that time 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.010
 I already do that and there I am right 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 spotted so it's really only too 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.430
 recommend if you are a beginner 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 but also advanced 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.079
 and just as a beginner one comes too 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 very good in the corner we have here 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.059
 Of course, the whole leaflet the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.649
 blanket list and so on that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.129
 but we are not interested 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.989
 We are only interested in the cards 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.640
 and paths we can see then immediately 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.110
 this is the gripper here yes that is the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 MasterCard 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.160
 the master deck card and here we go 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.640
 times the cards through here we have the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.860
 whole dark worlds monster 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.189
 on it the whole deck is here kg 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.240
 grand prix or how to speak yourself 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.430
 Everybody actually has his own 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 I say here pronunciation is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.080
 also well known it is also 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.030
 in different rarities one of the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.670
 playing cards is also tragic 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 clearly sang gone definitely doubled 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.950
 king a very interesting card he 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.670
 becomes stronger the more environmental monster 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.049
 man on the field has rise because 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.680
 the apk points to 1000 times the number 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.189
 on 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.869
 and of course clean cards 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.579
 Of course, they should not be missing 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.100
 Business with the dark world 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.890
 enticements of darkness very strong 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 cards land in front of the window out too 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.280
 deck with very many strong players 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.470
 cards 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.530
