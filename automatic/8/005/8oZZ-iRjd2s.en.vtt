run that heat gun on there with
basically<00:07:02.260> 100<00:07:02.380> degrees<00:07:02.830> for<00:07:03.190> hair<00:07:03.850> dryer

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
basically 100 degrees for hair dryer

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.720 
basically 100 degrees for hair dryer
temp<00:07:04.680> just<00:07:05.680> a<00:07:05.800> little<00:07:06.010> bit<00:07:06.130> you<00:07:06.280> can<00:07:06.370> see<00:07:06.430> how

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
temp just a little bit you can see how

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.350 
temp just a little bit you can see how
that<00:07:06.910> fluff<00:07:07.210> out<00:07:08.640> and<00:07:09.640> give<00:07:09.880> you<00:07:09.970> a<00:07:10.000> little<00:07:10.120> bit

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
that fluff out and give you a little bit

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.600 
that fluff out and give you a little bit
of<00:07:10.480> motion<00:07:10.780> there<00:07:10.990> in<00:07:11.140> the<00:07:11.230> water<00:07:11.520> gives<00:07:12.520> you

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
of motion there in the water gives you

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:21.920 
of motion there in the water gives you
plenty<00:07:12.820> of<00:07:12.940> bulk<00:07:13.150> with<00:07:14.110> no<00:07:14.410> wait<00:07:15.270> flash<00:07:16.270> and

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.210 

the<00:07:22.930> hydraulic<00:07:23.290> action<00:07:23.740> in<00:07:23.860> that<00:07:23.980> water

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220 
the hydraulic action in that water

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.450 
the hydraulic action in that water
actually<00:07:25.470> pushes<00:07:26.470> that<00:07:26.590> back<00:07:26.830> as<00:07:27.070> you<00:07:27.190> strip

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.460 
actually pushes that back as you strip

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.719 
actually pushes that back as you strip
it<00:07:28.440> because<00:07:29.440> it's<00:07:29.620> a<00:07:29.710> pretty<00:07:29.950> emotional

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.810 

so

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820 
so

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.920 
so
there<00:07:35.390> you<00:07:35.570> have<00:07:35.750> it

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
there you have it

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.230 
there you have it
you

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.869 

just<00:07:41.240> a<00:07:41.330> little<00:07:41.479> idea<00:07:41.900> of<00:07:41.930> Carol<00:07:42.379> outside<00:07:42.879> my

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879
