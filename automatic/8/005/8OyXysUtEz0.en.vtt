this<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> an<00:00:19.620> open<00:00:19.980> E<00:00:20.130> major<00:00:20.490> chord<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this is an open E major chord in the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.599 
this is an open E major chord in the
first<00:00:21.510> position

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.249 

again<00:00:25.609> it's<00:00:25.789> another<00:00:26.029> six<00:00:26.390> string<00:00:26.689> cord<00:00:27.019> and

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
again it's another six string cord and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.040 
again it's another six string cord and
it<00:00:27.349> has<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.650> root<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.160> sixth<00:00:28.699> string<00:00:29.050> the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
it has the root on the sixth string the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.369 
it has the root on the sixth string the
fourth<00:00:30.349> string<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.710> first<00:00:33.949> string<00:00:35.379> so

fourth string and the first string so

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.990 
fourth string and the first string so
make<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.590> note<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:37.040> where<00:00:37.190> those<00:00:37.399> roots<00:00:37.790> are

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
make a note of where those roots are

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.729 
make a note of where those roots are
especially<00:00:38.420> when<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:38.899> move<00:00:39.079> them<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:39.559> can

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
especially when you move them so you can

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.189 
especially when you move them so you can
locate<00:00:39.920> specific<00:00:40.579> tones<00:00:41.239> within<00:00:41.540> each<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:42.110> the

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
locate specific tones within each of the

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.530 
locate specific tones within each of the
shapes<00:00:42.440> let's<00:00:43.399> move<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:43.760> up<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.239> key<00:00:44.420> of

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
shapes let's move this up to the key of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.840 
shapes let's move this up to the key of
C<00:00:44.780> from<00:00:45.110> e<00:00:45.879> first<00:00:46.879> we'll<00:00:47.059> reefing<00:00:47.479> er<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:49.040> then

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
C from e first we'll reefing er and then

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.619 
C from e first we'll reefing er and then
move<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.149> up<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.479> 8th<00:00:50.690> position<00:00:52.479> to<00:00:53.479> begin

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
move it up to the 8th position to begin

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.740 
move it up to the 8th position to begin
it<00:00:53.839> now<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.199> a<00:00:54.290> C<00:00:54.469> chord<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:56.269> it's<00:00:56.479> an<00:00:56.570> e

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
it now it's a C chord that is it's an e

important<00:01:01.549> guitar<00:01:01.850> concepts<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.570> first<00:01:02.780> is

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
important guitar concepts the first is

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.830 
important guitar concepts the first is
the<00:01:03.080> full<00:01:03.290> Barre<00:01:03.500> chord<00:01:04.180> which<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.210> used<00:01:05.600> in

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
the full Barre chord which is used in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.960 
the full Barre chord which is used in
many<00:01:06.080> Tunes<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.250> also<00:01:07.430> gives<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.939> the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
many Tunes and it also gives you the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.210 
many Tunes and it also gives you the
basic<00:01:08.479> blues<00:01:08.780> box<00:01:09.110> position<00:01:09.799> that<00:01:10.100> is

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
basic blues box position that is

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.270 
basic blues box position that is
probably<00:01:10.579> the<00:01:10.700> most<00:01:10.790> common<00:01:11.240> for<00:01:11.390> soloing<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.210 

a<00:01:16.280> pentatonic<00:01:16.579> scale<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.570> shape<00:01:21.100> now<00:01:22.100> in

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
a pentatonic scale in that shape now in

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.490 
a pentatonic scale in that shape now in
using<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.670> Blues<00:01:22.939> box<00:01:23.299> you'll<00:01:23.899> play<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.170> C

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
using the Blues box you'll play a C

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.179 
using the Blues box you'll play a C
major<00:01:24.740> chord<00:01:25.990> but<00:01:26.990> you'll<00:01:27.200> play<00:01:27.530> licks<00:01:28.040> that

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
major chord but you'll play licks that

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
major chord but you'll play licks that
sound<00:01:28.610> like<00:01:28.729> C<00:01:29.000> minor

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100 

inside<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.500> c-shape<00:01:42.240> here's<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.330> lick<00:01:43.630> inside

inside the c-shape here's a lick inside

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.960 
inside the c-shape here's a lick inside
that<00:01:44.380> shape<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:44.890> reminiscent<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.610> Stevie

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
that shape that's reminiscent of Stevie
