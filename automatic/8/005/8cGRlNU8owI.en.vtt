 Of medium size, I think that 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:39.890
 leaves entirely be a little big 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:50.350

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:54.400
 I grind strawberries I went over and washed 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:04.850
 be sure to lie strawberries liter 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.829
 a glass of sugar began to boil 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:02:00.010
 you can mix and leave let 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:03.280
 boil look my my strawberry 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.220
 sugar has already begun to boil and I will now 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.770
 boil it with the first glasses of sugar 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.640
 five minutes and you need to constantly like this 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.640
 stir 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.040
 look at me already on a big fire 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.670
 strawberry will buy five minutes exactly five 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:39.690
 minutes and now i add 2 glasses here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 sugar and also stir everything so far 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:57.150
 boil timed 55 minutes and cook on 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:03:09.030
 big fire already with the second glass 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 sugar for another 5 minutes and add the same 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.840
 the last third glass of sugar and all 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.580
 just as well 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.120
 boils boil and cook for 5 more minutes 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.120
 high heat 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.310
 See my strawberry jam already 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.240
 boils 15 minutes but if you take it all together 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.680
 now we could 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.540
 are we going to see if our jam is ready 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.540
 Now we check the signal and so we do 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:59.700
 here you see here this strip still 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.250
 a little quick and numb then I 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.890
 I think that we can make our jam 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.340
 just two or three more minutes 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.340
 was boiling 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:26.490
 well my jam is already turning off boiled 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:29.040
 two more minutes now let's see 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.380
 see it means that the jam is already 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.840
 ready I don't want her to be with me 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:41.460
 turned out so thick so I have it 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.980
 already rented only removed the jam look 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.380
 here are the jars they should be dry 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.480
 in which we will throw our 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.240
 jam and in which we will close 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.700
 and so over the steam you need them 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.700
 just a minute 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.700
 to hold 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.330
 By this I sterilized our banks 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.870
 use any method convenient for you 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.720
 can lay out jars and lids warmed 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.420
 oven and literally two or three minutes to 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.240
 they warmed up there very well later 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.890
 good way 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:48.360
 new to that microwave i heard but i 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:56.970
 so she never did and merge 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:59.640
 jam bath is that it is now a 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:04.830
 liquid can not be afraid she must 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:07.140
 freezes for me this is the most convenient and 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:17.910
 as i say express method 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:20.400
 cooking strawberry jam and there 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.370
 and that here I will add a little more 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.640
 jam here is this jar 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:31.460
 Now we sit with pancakes and here it is 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.460
 will be on the ground I'll close turn on 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:43.410
 can use such banks which 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.190
 immediately close look she 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.860
 freezes 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.310
 I think that in an hour or two she already 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.490
 completely freeze look after three 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:07:05.460
 hours and we already froze now 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:09.300
 let's see what I got as 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:12.030
 just the way i wanted but if you 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.460
 want her to have you a little bit 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:24.060
 mouth for a few minutes 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:34.440
 you a minute or two more now 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:36.350
