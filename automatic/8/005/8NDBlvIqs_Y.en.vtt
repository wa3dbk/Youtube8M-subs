00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.740
 favors point flight schools 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.410
 these simulators I want to write 600 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.990
 ready to be sold then a 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.540

 in schools I really fly with the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.590
 movement of the plane and therefore is not a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.810
 computer flight simulator but it is 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.740
