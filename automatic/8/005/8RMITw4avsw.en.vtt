00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 for and welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.140
 blaine dollars 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.880
 I will teach you how to serve you 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.549
 the three main broadcasters shots of 22 hours 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.740
 so already for the following pattern on the tablet 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.129
 but I had already done so that they did not know to modify in progress 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.339
 and so there for a list of several possible with honors 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.429
 so we go in this tutorial we will focus on three or ten 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.109
 hours 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.509
 the south and I surpass myself 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.649
 the different taste mirror 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.669
 and the damn time yes 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 if the faces surface 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.740
 from daron sperm actually saying the angles 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.560
 the batteries 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.760
 so it's mainly used for character modeling 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.930
 different runners 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.610
 level 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.370
 jobs 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 decision 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.260
 what he denies 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.110
 3 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.110
 so then and we can see also by the way you say 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.690
 the cube remained the same we see some say 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.520
 it's only 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 a report 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.460
 a product or partial since the site does not remove the subdivision the cube 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.330
 resume its original form 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
 fillon 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.220
 lust 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.420
 mirror which is often used for symmetrical objects and say pretty much 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 all objects made in 3d 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 read the change in power 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.520
 we will go into mode and say we may be stolen 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.920
 crypt cost 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.400
 so here 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.430
 we are going now 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.020
 all selected 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.940
 he qualified as May 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.850
 traces of the side 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 we could then vertice mix so here we have more than half of the cube 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.840
 so why have the potter of the cube we are afraid to use a mobile the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.399
 survival horror 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.969
 mekhissi only see a second 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.559
 side of worship was created 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:19.499
 and who is not afraid as if pete doherty 6 because otherwise modified because it's 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.019
 exact symmetry 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.300
 2 the first part here we diction converted six on one side 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.549
 it is changing fast exactly symmetrically on the other side j 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.379
 which makes it easy to create 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.549
 for example at the level of character creation 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.549
 change them in what the south he is young and she 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.779
 it emerges mainly from physics 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.689
 to create characters 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 perfectly cyclical 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
 now now we're going to see the modify their problems 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 Yes of course 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.129
 good I will apply and modify in progress to avoid mistakes 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.930
 so still not but that allow to make a perfect copy of 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.930
 subject 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.969
 neither vote copy we can think of succeeding- 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:25.029
 on which targets on the tour you can also do on the subject 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.029
 there 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 on the dl axis 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.679
 we can choose the spacing between the two copies 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.689
 and he can not also choose 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 the number which reassures 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.329
 Viasuisse 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.749
 he allows mayor to realize the little world of rather repetitive objects 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.489
 concrete example of a building that avoids us to create all floors 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.689
 to create a floor and we use the kovalainen function to do this all 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.579
 floors for example 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.290
 so that's all for this presentation of the three main 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.959
 modify the order
