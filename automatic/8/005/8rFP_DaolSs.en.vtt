and I came across a part of the book
that<00:00:06.509> basically<00:00:06.660> explains<00:00:07.500> my<00:00:07.770> deadlift<00:00:08.220> form

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
that basically explains my deadlift form

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.030 
that basically explains my deadlift form
perfectly<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.230> just<00:00:10.410> perfect

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
perfectly like this is just perfect

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.160 
perfectly like this is just perfect
this<00:00:11.190> explains<00:00:11.700> why<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.480> why<00:00:12.630> others<00:00:12.960> do

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this explains why I do it why others do

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.289 
this explains why I do it why others do
the<00:00:13.349> rounded<00:00:13.710> upper<00:00:13.950> back<00:00:14.190> thing<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.730> none<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the rounded upper back thing and none of

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.300 
the rounded upper back thing and none of
us<00:00:15.450> get<00:00:15.690> injured<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.170> anything<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.680> why

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
us get injured or anything like that why

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.420 
us get injured or anything like that why
we<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.880> under<00:00:18.210> such<00:00:18.539> heavy<00:00:18.750> loads<00:00:19.430> so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
we can do it under such heavy loads so

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.929 
we can do it under such heavy loads so
this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.600> page<00:00:21.869> 46<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.920> supple<00:00:23.550> leopard

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this is on page 46 of supple leopard

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.750 
this is on page 46 of supple leopard
check<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.960> book<00:00:25.140> out<00:00:25.350> read<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.609> want

check the book out read that if you want
to<00:00:26.849> read<00:00:26.970> more<00:00:27.150> about<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:28.470> gonna<00:00:28.560> go

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
to read more about this but I'm gonna go

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
to read more about this but I'm gonna go
over<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.070> basically<00:00:30.140> when<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> lift

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
over this basically when you lift

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
over this basically when you lift
something<00:00:31.590> from<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> braced<00:00:32.610> flexed<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.360> braced

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
something from a braced flexed or braced

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.410 
something from a braced flexed or braced
extended<00:00:34.350> position<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> brace<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
extended position you have to brace in

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.940 
extended position you have to brace in
that<00:00:36.540> arched<00:00:36.809> position<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.559> maintain<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that arched position and maintain that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.190 
that arched position and maintain that
position<00:00:38.700> through<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> full<00:00:39.629> range<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
position through the full range of the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
position through the full range of the
movement<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.969> when<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.300> into<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> braced

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
movement so when I get into a braced

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.310 
movement so when I get into a braced
flexed<00:00:43.469> position<00:00:44.660> basically<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.809> maintain

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
flexed position basically I maintain

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
flexed position basically I maintain
that<00:00:46.559> throughout<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> whole<00:00:47.100> deadlift<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that throughout the whole deadlift you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
that throughout the whole deadlift you
know<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> upper<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.590> curvature

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
know I have that upper back curvature

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.540 
know I have that upper back curvature
and<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> where<00:00:51.840> people<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.289> confused

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and this is where people get confused

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
and this is where people get confused
braced<00:00:53.550> flexion<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.300> extension<00:00:54.809> is
