00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
it up inside it's two pieces mayita this

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.860 
it up inside it's two pieces mayita this
again<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.520> gun<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.730> actually<00:03:47.180> rare<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.780> then

again the gun is actually rare and then
the<00:03:47.990> figure<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.320> can<00:03:48.500> find<00:03:48.740> rat<00:03:49.280> trap<00:03:49.580> for

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
the figure you can find rat trap for

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.660 
the figure you can find rat trap for
very<00:03:51.170> little<00:03:51.380> money<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:51.980> you're<00:03:52.430> not<00:03:52.520> going

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670
