00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.019
 Hi people 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 Today I'm here to do the video. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.660
 Digitizing my good hair I have one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.920
 Long time without touching my hair I had 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 made some lights to fans in the past 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 It was November if I 'm not mistaken and then 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.449
 since then there has been no entry 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.669
 exaggerated so I'm feeling that he 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 You need to give an update 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.290
 leave a little more bumpy 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.530
 the most suitable inhabitants to give a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 the color leave more glow so the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.190
 color is like this now and good I did once 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.649
 be nothing to see your hair at home and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.980
 I will now I want to see you now 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.980
 I'm going to try another incentive that is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.969
 from here I already opened what you want 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 This one on the blog you got static 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.520
 that establishes nations and is a pearl eye 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.830
 I have an eye for choice because the eye 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.439
 more drawn by a seated than I 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.960
 I prefer not ruled yellow then by 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.610
 I prefer this one who wants to see 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.610
 just follow it step by step now 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.550
 small bomb 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 I returned already I left around 15 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.040
 I liked the result because I 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.810
 I was so I wanted to have 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.890
 avoided more subtle 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.200
 thus totalizing varies according to the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.320
 eye of you from my hair he is with 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 the lights but not with so many lights 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.970
 so already with enough lights 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.060
 He's going to stay much more, he loves you so much. 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 more alive then when I have my 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.239
 natural hair along with the lights is it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.820
 take some of my hair I had 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.220
 Dark is the dark blond as with 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.890
 lights I had I liked quite and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.890
 he kind of neutralized then 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.170
 It was kind of strange so I liked it 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.120
 much of the state expects a result that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.610
 I wanted was to let the hair will 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.269
 manage to keep hair and served elton 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.019
 long time without doing nothing in my 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.700
 hair type light and everything 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.830
 so then only responds it's okay 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.250
 neutralized here the color nÃ© 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:13.530
 he also gave away the lights 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.340
 then it's proven now present 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.799
 I loved civilians, you do not want to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.459
 share my own that you and 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.459
 to the next
