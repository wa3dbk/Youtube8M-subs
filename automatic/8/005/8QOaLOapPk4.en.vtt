these two devices today now the
interesting<00:00:39.809> thing<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.370> website

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
interesting thing here is a website

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.410 
interesting thing here is a website
called<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.899> tech<00:00:43.559> took<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> discovered

called and and tech took and discovered

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
called and and tech took and discovered
that<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.200> samsung<00:00:46.920> galaxy<00:00:46.950> folks<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.820> put

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that the samsung galaxy folks have put

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600 
that the samsung galaxy folks have put
several<00:00:48.329> lines<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> code<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.710> Samsung

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
several lines of code into the Samsung

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.299 
several lines of code into the Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:50.640> Note<00:00:51.180> 3<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.570> had<00:00:52.469> made<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
Galaxy Note 3 and had made it so the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.119 
Galaxy Note 3 and had made it so the
processor<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.850> run<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.600> higher<00:00:54.930> speed

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
processor would run at a higher speed

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.340 
processor would run at a higher speed
when<00:00:56.129> certain<00:00:56.610> benchmarking<00:00:57.360> apps<00:00:57.600> were<00:00:57.930> run

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
when certain benchmarking apps were run

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.639 
when certain benchmarking apps were run
now<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.010> average<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.090> found<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.809> processor

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
now on average they found the processor

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
now on average they found the processor
speeds<00:01:01.980> were<00:01:02.129> increased<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
speeds were increased or the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.939 
speeds were increased or the
benchmarking<00:01:03.960> numbers<00:01:04.350> were<00:01:04.470> increased<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
benchmarking numbers were increased I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.760 
benchmarking numbers were increased I
should<00:01:05.129> say<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.420> zero<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> five<00:01:07.290> percent

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
should say by about zero to five percent

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
should say by about zero to five percent
more<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:09.030> cases<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.600> much<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.140> ten

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
more in some cases as much as ten

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
more in some cases as much as ten
percent<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.430> we're<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
percent so what we're going to do is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
percent so what we're going to do is
present<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> today<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.799> benchmarking

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
present to you today the benchmarking

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
present to you today the benchmarking
versus<00:01:14.880> comparisons<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.780> normally<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
versus comparisons that we normally do

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380 
versus comparisons that we normally do
on<00:01:16.409> phones<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> kind<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
on phones and we're going to kind of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
on phones and we're going to kind of
talk<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.470> five<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:19.920> ten<00:01:20.100> percent<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
talk about what five or ten percent is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300 
talk about what five or ten percent is
once<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> gets<00:01:21.840> locked<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.740> how<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
once it gets locked off and how it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.090 
once it gets locked off and how it
compares<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:24.000> iphone<00:01:24.420> 5s<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.860> we're<00:01:25.979> going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
compares see iphone 5s and we're going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
compares see iphone 5s and we're going
to<00:01:26.159> give<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.549> numbers<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.390> decide<00:01:27.720> what

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to give you the numbers to decide what

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.719 
to give you the numbers to decide what
you<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> we're<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you think about it we're not going to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.950 
you think about it we're not going to
say<00:01:29.850> they're<00:01:30.030> writing<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
say they're writing or I can see the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
say they're writing or I can see the
wrong<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.650> we're<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.950> present<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
wrong but we're going to present them to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
wrong but we're going to present them to
you<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.630> fun<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.110> and

took<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.489> god<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.139> pretty<00:03:56.139> much<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.470> note<00:03:56.739> 3<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
took a god and pretty much the note 3 it

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.210 
took a god and pretty much the note 3 it
looks<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:58.049> outpaced<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.290> most<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.100> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
looks like outpaced that most of the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.599 
looks like outpaced that most of the
time<00:04:00.600> in<00:04:01.600> fact<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:02.079> may<00:04:02.440> have<00:04:02.650> outpaced<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.489> all

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
time in fact it may have outpaced it all

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.479 
time in fact it may have outpaced it all
the<00:04:03.700> time<00:04:03.790> for<00:04:04.060> what<00:04:04.150> i<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.389> see<00:04:04.829> so<00:04:05.829> what<00:04:06.459> that

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
the time for what i can see so what that

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.020 
the time for what i can see so what that
tells<00:04:06.910> us<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.510> note<00:04:08.200> 3<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.500> fast<00:04:08.859> now<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:09.819> i

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
tells us is the note 3 is fast now if i

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.520 
tells us is the note 3 is fast now if i
take<00:04:10.239> ten<00:04:11.079> percent<00:04:11.560> off<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:11.980> which<00:04:12.190> is<00:04:12.220> what

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
take ten percent off that which is what

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.580 
take ten percent off that which is what
186<00:04:14.530> off<00:04:14.829> of<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.669> score<00:04:16.229> brings<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.380> down<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
186 off of that score brings it down to

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.900 
186 off of that score brings it down to
what<00:04:18.100> so

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
what so

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.190 
what so
or<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:20.940> 1700s<00:04:21.940> we'll<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.300> call<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.540> we're

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
or in the 1700s we'll just call it we're

now<00:06:00.100> what's<00:06:00.400> interesting<00:06:00.520> about<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.180> is<00:06:01.390> the

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
now what's interesting about this is the

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.080 
now what's interesting about this is the
rendering<00:06:02.230> for<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.590> note<00:06:02.770> 3<00:06:03.070> is<00:06:03.100> a<00:06:03.220> 1080p

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
rendering for the note 3 is a 1080p

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.020 
rendering for the note 3 is a 1080p
screen<00:06:04.750> it's<00:06:05.020> much<00:06:05.590> larger<00:06:05.890> and<00:06:06.310> of<00:06:06.790> course

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
screen it's much larger and of course
