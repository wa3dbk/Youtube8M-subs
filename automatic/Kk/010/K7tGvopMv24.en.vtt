down really fast

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.720 
down really fast
that's<00:03:19.700> like<00:03:19.970> controlled<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:22.190> then<00:03:22.340> left<00:03:22.550> and

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
that's like controlled and then left and

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.160 
that's like controlled and then left and
right<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.630> turn<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> different

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
right you can turn the different

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.870 
right you can turn the different
directions<00:03:24.290> it's<00:03:25.069> kind<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.400> like<00:03:25.520> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
directions it's kind of like the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.839 
directions it's kind of like the
original<00:03:26.569> Temple<00:03:26.989> Run<00:03:27.200> except<00:03:28.130> instead<00:03:28.610> of

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
original Temple Run except instead of

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.000 
original Temple Run except instead of
just<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.390> one<00:03:29.569> track<00:03:29.930> there's<00:03:30.380> three

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
just on the one track there's three

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.130 
just on the one track there's three
different<00:03:31.310> tracks<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:32.330> middle<00:03:32.840> left<00:03:32.989> and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
different tracks the middle left and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.000 
different tracks the middle left and
right<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:35.450> think<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:36.290> probably<00:03:36.530> wont<00:03:36.920> be

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
right so I think it's probably wont be

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.430 
right so I think it's probably wont be
the<00:03:37.040> most<00:03:37.160> fun<00:03:37.489> game<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.810> they<00:03:39.019> create<00:03:39.319> like

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
the most fun game that they create like

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.570 
the most fun game that they create like
there's<00:03:39.620> minion<00:03:40.040> rush

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
there's minion rush

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.040 
there's minion rush
there's<00:03:40.760> temple<00:03:41.510> run<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.840> they're<00:03:41.930> all

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
there's temple run and they're all

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.520 
there's temple run and they're all
pretty<00:03:42.739> much<00:03:42.860> similar<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.900> think<00:03:45.260> that

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
pretty much similar and I think that

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.900 
pretty much similar and I think that
this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:47.080> probably<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.410> best<00:03:48.860> in<00:03:49.160> my<00:03:49.370> opinion

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
this is probably the best in my opinion

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.229 
this is probably the best in my opinion
I<00:03:50.260> definitely<00:03:51.260> think<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:51.680> very<00:03:52.670> nice<00:03:53.030> so
