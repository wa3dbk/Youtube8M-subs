00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.259 
you do this thing came up too well the
logs<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.890> everything<00:04:18.160> came<00:04:18.280> up<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
logs and everything came up to the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.420 
logs and everything came up to the
burning<00:04:19.600> temperature<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.590> 15<00:04:21.400> minutes

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
burning temperature you know 15 minutes

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.590 
burning temperature you know 15 minutes
or<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:23.010> then<00:04:24.010> once<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.280> get<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.490> going<00:04:24.600> it

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
or so and then once you get it going it

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.370 
or so and then once you get it going it
takes<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:26.790> well<00:04:27.790> it's<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.300> seasoned<00:04:28.750> at<00:04:28.810> all<00:04:28.990> so

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
takes a well it's not seasoned at all so

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.900 
takes a well it's not seasoned at all so
it<00:04:29.500> takes<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.710> little<00:04:29.830> bit<00:04:29.950> longer<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.370> know

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
it takes a little bit longer you know

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.280 
it takes a little bit longer you know
maybe<00:04:31.030> another<00:04:31.180> half<00:04:31.419> hour<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:32.050> get<00:04:32.140> this

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
maybe another half hour to get this

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.880 
maybe another half hour to get this
thing<00:04:32.470> up<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.740> about<00:04:32.860> 225<00:04:33.669> 250<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.620> you

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
thing up to about 225 250 but as you

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.070 
thing up to about 225 250 but as you
season<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.940> gets<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.720> know<00:04:37.780> some<00:04:37.990> of

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
that soot in there and some of that

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.600 
that soot in there and some of that
smoke<00:04:39.520> flavor<00:04:39.669> in<00:04:39.970> there<00:04:41.160> much<00:04:42.160> much<00:04:42.400> better

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
smoke flavor in there much much better

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.659 
smoke flavor in there much much better
much<00:04:43.000> better<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.450> it'll<00:04:43.990> burn<00:04:44.110> less<00:04:44.169> fuel

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
much better and it'll burn less fuel

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.090 
much better and it'll burn less fuel
then<00:04:45.669> when<00:04:46.419> it's<00:04:46.570> when<00:04:47.500> it's<00:04:47.530> brand<00:04:47.830> new<00:04:47.890> like

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
gets seasoned it hold heat better it'll

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.389 
gets seasoned it hold heat better it'll
use<00:05:50.559> less<00:05:50.739> fuel<00:05:51.509> but<00:05:52.509> this<00:05:52.659> is<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:52.779> first<00:05:53.019> run

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:53.399 
use less fuel but this is the first run
