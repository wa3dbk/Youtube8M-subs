00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the coke off of the relic op this axe

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.029 
the coke off of the relic op this axe
head<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.499> and<00:00:34.789> then<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:40.039> there

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
head now and then and actually there

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.989 
head now and then and actually there
hasn't<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.699> change<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:47.550> still<00:00:47.850> have

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
hasn't been much change we still have

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.040 
hasn't been much change we still have
those<00:00:48.149> foreign<00:00:48.659> bodies<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:51.019> yeah<00:00:52.019> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
those foreign bodies on here yeah I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.469 
those foreign bodies on here yeah I
guess<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> looks<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.219> bit<00:00:53.429> of<00:00:53.579> rust

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
guess it looks like a little bit of rust

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.360 
guess it looks like a little bit of rust
removed<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.440> once<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.859> hit<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.249> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
removed and I once I hit it with the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.500 
removed and I once I hit it with the
brush<00:00:56.609> I'm<00:00:56.909> sure<00:00:57.120> it'll<00:00:57.649> be<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.679> lot<00:00:58.920> better<00:00:59.249> but

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.870 

as<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.839> said<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> comments<00:01:04.850> coke<00:01:05.850> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
as you said in the comments coke just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
as you said in the comments coke just
isn't<00:01:06.480> what<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> used<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.710> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
isn't what it used to be which is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.120 
isn't what it used to be which is
probably<00:01:08.220> good<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:09.030> belly<00:01:09.830> since<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.920> drink

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
probably good for my belly since I drink

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.730 
probably good for my belly since I drink
a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> coke<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> also<00:01:15.350> put<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.410> other

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a lot of coke but I also put some other

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.690 
a lot of coke but I also put some other
objects<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.700> well<00:01:19.100> those<00:01:20.100> cleaned<00:01:20.490> off

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
objects in as well those cleaned off

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
objects in as well those cleaned off
those<00:01:21.000> cantos<00:01:21.980> mold<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:24.750> does<00:01:25.050> look<00:01:25.260> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
those cantos mold that does look a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.749 
those cantos mold that does look a
little<00:01:25.500> better

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.069 

doing<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.820> little<00:01:34.000> more<00:01:34.149> research<00:01:34.210> online<00:01:34.810> I

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
doing a little more research online I

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.690 
doing a little more research online I
found<00:01:35.759> white<00:01:36.759> vinegar<00:01:38.189> recipe<00:01:39.189> for<00:01:39.549> white

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
found white vinegar recipe for white

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.179 
found white vinegar recipe for white
vinegar<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.350> baking<00:01:42.130> soda<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.920> drawn<00:01:45.159> a

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
vinegar and baking soda and I'm drawn a

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.730 
vinegar and baking soda and I'm drawn a
bling<00:01:45.549> but<00:01:45.939> I<00:01:46.000> put<00:01:46.240> in<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.539> last<00:01:46.960> comments<00:01:47.649> a

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
bling but I put in the last comments a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.080 
bling but I put in the last comments a
last<00:01:49.679> video<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:54.520> trying<00:01:54.819> to<00:01:54.880> get<00:01:54.969> all<00:01:55.060> that

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
last video just trying to get all that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:07.979 
last video just trying to get all that
coke<00:01:55.509> is<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:06.399> interesting<00:02:07.149> this<00:02:07.720> came

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
coke is really interesting this came

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.580 
coke is really interesting this came
from<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.319> church<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.750> those<00:02:10.989> like<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.319> little

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
from the church not those like a little

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.270 
from the church not those like a little
bit<00:02:11.739> better

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
bit better

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.000 
bit better
hopefully<00:02:13.150> it'll<00:02:13.870> take<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.380> wire<00:02:14.620> brush<00:02:14.980> to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
hopefully it'll take that wire brush to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.960 
hopefully it'll take that wire brush to
really<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.640> it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
really get it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.559 
really get it
better<00:02:16.510> clean<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:18.910> what<00:02:19.030> else<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.360> got<00:02:19.390> in

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
better clean see what else we got in

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.539 
better clean see what else we got in
there<00:02:19.720> should<00:02:20.049> be<00:02:20.170> another<00:02:20.380> conscience<00:02:21.190> more

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
there should be another conscience more

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:31.110 
there should be another conscience more
nails<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.690> coke<00:02:29.310> might<00:02:30.310> as<00:02:30.400> well<00:02:30.549> just<00:02:30.730> drink

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
nails so coke might as well just drink

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.199 
nails so coke might as well just drink
it<00:02:31.269> probably<00:02:32.049> not<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.319> best<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:37.030> gonna<00:02:37.090> be

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
it probably not the best we're gonna be

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.110 
it probably not the best we're gonna be
trying<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.750> electrical<00:02:38.500> or<00:02:39.400> electrolysis

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
trying the electrical or electrolysis

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.250 
trying the electrical or electrolysis
here<00:02:40.769> maybe<00:02:41.769> I'll<00:02:41.859> try<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.489> weekend

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
here maybe I'll try that this weekend

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.490 
here maybe I'll try that this weekend
it's<00:02:44.260> cold<00:02:44.590> as<00:02:44.769> hell<00:02:44.799> here<00:02:45.280> now<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:46.500> little

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's cold as hell here now and a little

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.160 
it's cold as hell here now and a little
bit<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.709> snow<00:02:47.829> but<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.370> not<00:02:48.519> going<00:02:48.790> anywhere

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
bit of snow but it's not going anywhere

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.949 
bit of snow but it's not going anywhere
our<00:02:50.170> water<00:02:50.470> outsides<00:02:51.010> freezing<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:54.959> don't

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
our water outsides freezing so don't

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.729 
our water outsides freezing so don't
know<00:02:56.139> I'm<00:02:56.470> past<00:02:57.340> December<00:02:57.880> now<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.739> it's

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
know I'm past December now and it's

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.559 
know I'm past December now and it's
research<00:03:00.220> time<00:03:00.609> so<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.000> probably<00:03:01.239> won't<00:03:01.389> be

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
research time so I probably won't be

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.830 
research time so I probably won't be
hunting<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.989> much<00:03:03.299> although<00:03:04.299> I'm<00:03:04.510> kind<00:03:04.780> of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
hunting that much although I'm kind of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.849 
hunting that much although I'm kind of
dying<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.440> back<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.239> church<00:03:07.239> dig

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
dying to get back to that church dig

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.960 
dying to get back to that church dig
probably<00:03:08.859> be<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.099> once<00:03:09.340> or<00:03:09.489> twice<00:03:09.700> this

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
probably be there once or twice this

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.210 
probably be there once or twice this

so<00:03:20.370> our<00:03:20.580> coke<00:03:20.850> experiment<00:03:22.190> although

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
so our coke experiment although

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.550 
so our coke experiment although
interesting<00:03:24.060> probably<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.810> waste<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.170> time

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.850 

although<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:30.330> see<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:33.380> stuff<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> bottom

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
although you see the stuff on the bottom

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.950 
although you see the stuff on the bottom
of<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:39.540> container<00:03:40.050> there<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.630> probably

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
of the container there this is probably

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.410 
of the container there this is probably
the<00:03:43.080> worst<00:03:43.290> I'm<00:03:44.250> sure<00:03:44.460> that'll<00:03:44.730> clean<00:03:45.030> up<00:03:45.210> now

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the worst I'm sure that'll clean up now

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.640 
the worst I'm sure that'll clean up now
I'm<00:03:45.540> pretty<00:03:45.690> good<00:03:45.990> with<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:47.490> brush<00:03:48.140> well<00:03:49.140> what
