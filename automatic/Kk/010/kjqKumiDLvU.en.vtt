00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969
 the 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.969
 the broadcaster 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 looking for a good one 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 the number of customers in the netherlands and in steps, it remains to be seen how it works 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.730
 is part of it 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.239
 the fair lasts from Friday, July 15, welcome welcome insurers benefit 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.140
 because of a relatively high interest rate 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.189
 nico bakker has the technical condition of the dutch insurers 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.720
 organized here is 4 this is the best state of this group of people 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.400
 not excited shortly on which insurance company again benefit from the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.550
 Rising interest in the capital market We have benefited from the high council 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.470
 Incomprehensibly a very simple reason that someone is covered by warranty products 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.060
 so many say it's after the end of the term 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.550
 You get in your head to get back and a fixed interest rate component is preferred 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.889
 We also need to be more attractive 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.530
 the longer the interest 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680
 thereby come to lie 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.780
 they can also benefit from it 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.860
 a higher interest rate 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 for the time being it seems the middle certain technically is the best 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.610
 31 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.540
 a choice of 3 stl 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 we have the background in sales 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.180
 I, one of the inventors, do not differ much from each other 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.180
 really sad that I have to say 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.570
 the honor of being there would be a wanting to start man who offers technical in itself 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.830
 seen and more interesting opportunities 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.310
 for the requirement of the reason that there has been a steady progress for a long time and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.160
 situation 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.230
 so a technical and instant process of higher tops and higher bottoms it is 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.770
 some resistance to the short term 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 between 16 and 16 half euros 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.960
 and dancing that gives a slight collision with the yellow 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.610
 does not mean that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.600
 the drents are completely destroyed, on the contrary, residents are still coming 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.070
 to be higher fractionally higher at this time is an expected ability 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.050
 soil formation very between 14 and the bike half a euro 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.069
 so in itself one at a playing field 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.519
 abyss are half under tire and more than six tenths comes up 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.500
 given the trendality, that was the headline of the subjective 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.439
 The term is always interesting to sacrifice weak days or weak moments 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.239
 and you simply purchase if the farmers above the 14 to 4 12 euros quotes 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.069
 every potency was told nicely nicer 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.429
 yes do that 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:25.969
 now the first san siro bombastic 16 to the sixteen half that is surely a one 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.889
 small one 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.150
 being taken out 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.410
 then I have no other reference points than the one to set up in the twenties 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.990
 zone 20 25 euros brother of 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.529
 against simple possibilities so if I think so beautiful then I think 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.049
 to step in now and wait to see if there is plenty of vacation 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.439
 media 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.450
 they run on four or note boarding for short-term purposes 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:53.129
 a little after more than sixteen and above sixteen for pick up before then 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.099
 the expected recovery has dropped by 20 yes to well into the twenties than should be expected 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.609
 to one year two years 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.759
 just note that the sizes move I think that the inland port months to the 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:06.999
 Possibilities include some money so booking the vacation of course we 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.119
 go with the second twice sns reaal 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.919
 yes sns reaal is now possible the player who has not participated in it for so long 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.430
 field 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.029
 that is why I wanted to include the day chart instead of the weekly chart 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.879
 the hedgehog was with the weekly chart 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.909
 and then gasoline and some interesting things 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.849
 in the first place, again, a reasonable trend movement 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:32.019
 the quoted costs for the rates are higher on the right than on the left so in good condition 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:32.980
 cation of one 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.389
 tendency to rise 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.910
 but the mobility is quite high, we still see left and right 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.959
 a nasty jump up and down 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.060
 once again on balance 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.929
 a the positive trend of haase 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:45.709
 with short term 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.870
 resistance for the min 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.359
 just under 18 euros 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059
 and control soil formation 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.080
 so around 17 so that means they have it right now 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.750
 less interesting to make a purchase 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.199
 because a spacious one is coming and the next few hours of rain 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.790
 That is the head of a risk that is doing 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.609
 less interesting proposition I would wait to be able to do soil formation in the 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.689
 near the seventeen that are the better switching moments 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.090
 piggyback to the hairdresser 18 and then came back 19 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.699
 that is expected in the short term 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 for example, a Dutch axa club has been taken over 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.169
 free technicians no longer offer the consequences 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.990
 no it may have to be reflected in the rate at the moment 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.439
 as said, both city councils stand 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.469
 remain seated we are that is the story bend went into positions 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.120
 this fund 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.510
 so no reason to get out 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.600
 but also not a direct reason for the transition to additional purchases at the dips 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.909
 arranged abroad annoyingly in recent years 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.479
 indicate 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.830
 clearly still my technical doubts about my 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.830
 and that is because the price winning phase is in transition 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.490
 current trends that weakened because we have the lower tops 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.280
 be put down 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.520
 have recently seen a top at over 36 then at hood 35 and now has 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.180
 the race struggling to steam through the 34 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.129
 so and diving downward pressure does increase 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.330
 does not mean that the band is definitive in the longer term 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.539
 beaten away for that, it is much too early 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.999
 then there is still room up to the stairs 30, in the extreme case nineteenth 75 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.930
 but then it really happened below that 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.080
 lies the contours of a down trend 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.159
 And yes, and that makes the fund less attractive at the moment 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.580
 before the medium-term cement yields short-term money you stop there 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.069
 up to 35 that is allowed but the finger on the pulse is desirable perhaps it is so 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.029
 noticed but 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.329
 it is quite restless in the banking world yes if there is anything left to worry about 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:47.409
 one of these three the screens are on the technical picture 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.339
 yes then federal states go because then an opponent takes their place 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.760
 hands 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.320
 then it must still determine the defects 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.630
 but the pricing there you have to put a question mark we just show 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.629
 let fischer be ignored for a moment 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:03.679
 and wait until peace returns and then go back to business 

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:06.860
 analyze I enjoy the Saint I do have 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.000
 we would like to receive the question or comments via redactie.wef nhd.nl 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.789
 nonsense mail address smit a good idea in the newsletter in the neighborhood tips 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.759
 for more costs a nice piquet
