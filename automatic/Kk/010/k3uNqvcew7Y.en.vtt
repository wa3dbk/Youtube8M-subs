wondering<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.420> difficulty<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> am<00:01:04.559> playing

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
wondering what difficulty I am playing

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.099 
wondering what difficulty I am playing
in<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.280> player<00:01:05.579> i<00:01:05.609> am<00:01:05.939> playing<00:01:06.179> on<00:01:06.389> superstar

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:07.109 
in my player i am playing on superstar

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.559 
in my player i am playing on superstar
and<00:01:07.319> the<00:01:07.740> reason<00:01:07.889> i<00:01:08.100> chose<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.639> go<00:01:08.819> superstar

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:09.569 
and the reason i chose to go superstar

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.870 
and the reason i chose to go superstar
this<00:01:09.959> year<00:01:10.259> because<00:01:10.740> last<00:01:10.889> I<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.399> playing<00:01:11.729> on

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
this year because last I was playing on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
this year because last I was playing on
hall<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.240> fame<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.139> was<00:01:13.259> really<00:01:13.670> frustrated

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
hall of fame and I was really frustrated

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
hall of fame and I was really frustrated
with<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.209> difficulty<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.899> felt<00:01:16.229> cheated<00:01:16.499> at

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
with that difficulty I felt cheated at

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
with that difficulty I felt cheated at
times<00:01:17.069> when<00:01:17.279> I<00:01:17.340> played<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:18.029> against<00:01:18.389> cpu

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
times when I played a good against cpu

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.109 
times when I played a good against cpu
so<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> reason<00:01:19.649> I<00:01:20.039> chose<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so that's the reason I chose to go to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.059 
so that's the reason I chose to go to
superstar<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.990> year<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.529> used<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
superstar this year to get used to the

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.359 
superstar this year to get used to the
game<00:01:23.310> gay<00:01:23.969> used<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> playing<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.740> player<00:01:26.069> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
game gay used to playing my player and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.279 
game gay used to playing my player and
hopefully<00:01:26.789> once<00:01:27.060> i<00:01:27.240> figure<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.569> out<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:28.200> will

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
hopefully once i figure that out i will

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.319 
hopefully once i figure that out i will
switch<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.889> to<00:01:28.920> hall<00:01:29.219> of<00:01:29.399> fame<00:01:29.579> probably

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
switch it to hall of fame probably

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
switch it to hall of fame probably
during<00:01:30.509> playoff<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.289> if<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
during playoff time if we make the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
during playoff time if we make the
playoffs<00:01:32.700> i<00:01:32.909> will<00:01:33.119> switch<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.389> hall<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.840> fame

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
playoffs i will switch the hall of fame

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.379 
playoffs i will switch the hall of fame
and<00:01:34.229> take<00:01:34.829> care<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.249> that<00:01:35.399> but<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:36.090> i'm

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389 
and take care of that but for now i'm

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:38.120 
and take care of that but for now i'm
sticking<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> superstar<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.770> i<00:01:38.069> think

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
sticking to superstar because i think

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
sticking to superstar because i think
that's<00:01:38.459> the<00:01:38.609> most<00:01:38.759> realistic<00:01:39.179> difficulty<00:01:39.779> at

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that's the most realistic difficulty at

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649 
that's the most realistic difficulty at
this<00:01:40.709> point<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.399> eventually<00:01:41.880> i<00:01:42.149> will<00:01:42.270> switch

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this point but eventually i will switch

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.029 
this point but eventually i will switch
to<00:01:42.689> hall<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.139> fame<00:01:43.319> so<00:01:43.529> don't<00:01:43.829> worry<00:01:43.889> about

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
to hall of fame so don't worry about

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.879 
to hall of fame so don't worry about
that<00:01:44.429> and<00:01:44.669> here<00:01:45.450> i<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:45.959> first<00:01:46.259> dynamic

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
that and here i get my first dynamic

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.219 
that and here i get my first dynamic
goal<00:01:47.099> of<00:01:47.279> my<00:01:47.429> career<00:01:47.849> and<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.779> believe<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
goal of my career and I believe it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
goal of my career and I believe it's
three<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.489> four<00:01:50.880> shots<00:01:51.209> I<00:01:51.419> have<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.659> make

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
three out of four shots I have to make

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.469 
three out of four shots I have to make
and<00:01:52.229> hopefully<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.039> can<00:01:53.219> make<00:01:53.429> them<00:01:53.819> because

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and hopefully I can make them because

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.449 
and hopefully I can make them because
