with<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.010> id0<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.310> with<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.780> addy<00:02:23.990> Peter<00:02:24.320> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
with the id0 and with the addy Peter and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.250 
with the id0 and with the addy Peter and
basically<00:02:25.760> with<00:02:25.940> any<00:02:26.090> boot<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.510> general<00:02:26.930> this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
basically with any boot in general this

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.170 
basically with any boot in general this
is<00:02:27.320> going<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.740> have<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.100> most<00:02:28.130> wear<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.970> tear

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
is going to have the most wear and tear

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.830 
is going to have the most wear and tear
on<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.480> boot<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.520> mean<00:02:31.520> leather<00:02:32.060> id0<00:02:32.570> since

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
on the boot I mean leather id0 since

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.560 
on the boot I mean leather id0 since
it's<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.500> thin<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:34.070> actually<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.300> wire

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
it's so thin you actually see this wire

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.540 
it's so thin you actually see this wire
down<00:02:35.810> after<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> day<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.770> after<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.370> day<00:02:37.520> of

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
down after a day like after a day of

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.520 
down after a day like after a day of
using<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.510> paint<00:02:38.780> will<00:02:39.080> chip<00:02:39.320> off

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
using them like the paint will chip off

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
using them like the paint will chip off
so<00:02:40.460> that's<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.240> nice<00:02:41.480> touch<00:02:41.780> by<00:02:42.170> ideas<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.340> really

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
so that's a nice touch by ideas I really

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.460 
so that's a nice touch by ideas I really
don't<00:02:43.730> follow<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.180> predator<00:02:44.780> line<00:02:45.020> as<00:02:45.230> well

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
don't follow the predator line as well

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.400 
don't follow the predator line as well
as<00:02:45.650> other<00:02:46.360> lines<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.720> I'm<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:48.020> sure<00:02:48.170> if<00:02:48.290> this

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
as other lines so I'm not sure if this

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.190 
as other lines so I'm not sure if this
has<00:02:48.590> always<00:02:48.740> been<00:02:48.920> there<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.780> me<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
has always been there but to me is the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.710 
has always been there but to me is the
first<00:02:51.380> time<00:02:51.470> I've<00:02:51.620> actually<00:02:51.710> ordered<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.820> real

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
first time I've actually ordered a real

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.480 
first time I've actually ordered a real
pair<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.020> predators<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> really

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
pair of predators and this is a really

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.070 
pair of predators and this is a really
nice<00:02:55.610> touch<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.120> have<00:02:56.240> that<00:02:56.420> clear<00:02:56.690> little

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
nice touch to have that clear little

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.220 
nice touch to have that clear little
coating<00:02:57.440> right<00:02:57.950> there<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.130> little<00:02:58.370> plastic

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
coating right there a little plastic

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.310 
coating right there a little plastic
rubbery<00:03:00.230> thing<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.740> keep<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.370> from<00:03:01.490> separating

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
rubbery thing to keep it from separating

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.630 
rubbery thing to keep it from separating
because<00:03:03.320> honestly<00:03:03.800> that's<00:03:03.890> where<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.520> get

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
because honestly that's where you get

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.170 
because honestly that's where you get
the<00:03:04.700> most<00:03:04.790> wear<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.450> tear<00:03:05.630> out<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.900> your<00:03:06.050> boots

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
the most wear and tear out of your boots

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.780 
the most wear and tear out of your boots
the<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.600> leather<00:03:08.810> itself<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.440> stores<00:03:09.790> it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the the leather itself it stores it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.650 
the the leather itself it stores it's
not<00:03:11.240> i'm<00:03:11.780> not<00:03:11.990> really<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.290> fan<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:13.390> how<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.540> not

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
not i'm not really a fan of how it's not

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.450 
not i'm not really a fan of how it's not

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.420 
kayla you know i love k leather with a
passion<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.570> bit<00:03:18.380> disappointed<00:03:18.950> how<00:03:19.130> i

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
passion and a bit disappointed how i

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.630 
passion and a bit disappointed how i
deed<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:21.260> starting<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.310> pull<00:03:22.430> away<00:03:22.460> from

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
deed is a starting to pull away from

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.050 
deed is a starting to pull away from
that<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:24.400> they're<00:03:25.400> going<00:03:25.550> into<00:03:25.790> taurus

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
that and they're going into taurus

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.880 
that and they're going into taurus
leather<00:03:26.240> which<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.900> guess<00:03:26.930> more<00:03:27.290> durable

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
leather which is I guess more durable

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.550 
leather which is I guess more durable
but<00:03:28.880> with<00:03:29.240> durability<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:30.110> just<00:03:30.350> don't<00:03:30.470> get

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
but with durability you just don't get

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.530 
but with durability you just don't get
that<00:03:30.620> soft<00:03:31.040> Kayla<00:03:31.370> their<00:03:31.640> touch<00:03:31.850> anymore<00:03:32.090> but

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
that soft Kayla their touch anymore but

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.540 
that soft Kayla their touch anymore but
we'll<00:03:33.140> see<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:34.100> mean<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:34.340> lightweight

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
we'll see that mean it's lightweight

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.580 
we'll see that mean it's lightweight
it's<00:03:36.220> water-resistant<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.600> we'll<00:03:39.260> see<00:03:39.410> how<00:03:39.440> it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
it's water-resistant so we'll see how it

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.700 
it's water-resistant so we'll see how it
does<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.820> it's<00:03:41.120> still<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.960> mean<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:42.230> decent

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
does but it's still I mean it's decent

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.160 
does but it's still I mean it's decent
you<00:03:42.860> know<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:44.030> little<00:03:44.660> leather<00:03:44.930> on<00:03:45.140> my

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
you know but the little leather on my

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.980 
you know but the little leather on my
idea<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.890> actually<00:03:46.220> softer<00:03:46.550> than<00:03:46.670> this<00:03:46.990> but

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
idea is actually softer than this but

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.630 
idea is actually softer than this but
then<00:03:48.110> again<00:03:48.230> these<00:03:48.470> have<00:03:48.740> been<00:03:48.920> used<00:03:49.340> at<00:03:49.580> all

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
then again these have been used at all

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.140 
then again these have been used at all
so<00:03:50.120> we'll<00:03:50.660> see<00:03:51.130> but<00:03:52.130> overall<00:03:52.700> I'm<00:03:53.030> pretty

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
so we'll see but overall I'm pretty

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.230 
so we'll see but overall I'm pretty
impressed<00:03:53.390> my<00:03:53.960> my<00:03:54.680> first<00:03:55.180> impression<00:03:56.180> on

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
impressed my my first impression on

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.060 
impressed my my first impression on
these<00:03:56.360> pretty<00:03:56.690> impressed

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.640 

they<00:04:01.070> fit<00:04:01.400> really<00:04:01.580> well<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:03.200> I'll<00:04:03.350> keep<00:04:03.530> you
