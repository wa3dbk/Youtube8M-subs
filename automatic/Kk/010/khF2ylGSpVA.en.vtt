have holes in them so what I'm going to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.150 
have holes in them so what I'm going to
be<00:00:12.240> covering<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.660> video<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.559> how<00:00:14.099> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
be covering in this video is a how to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.039 
be covering in this video is a how to
prevent<00:00:14.549> your<00:00:14.639> shoes<00:00:14.940> from<00:00:15.299> developing<00:00:15.870> holes

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
prevent your shoes from developing holes

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.570 
prevent your shoes from developing holes
in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.199> first<00:00:16.440> place<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.890> obviously<00:00:17.460> you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
in the first place and obviously you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.279 
in the first place and obviously you
can't<00:00:17.730> prevent<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.029> forever<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.109> will

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
can't prevent this forever but this will

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.050 
can't prevent this forever but this will
definitely<00:00:19.590> delay<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> time<00:00:20.460> until<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:20.970> get

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
definitely delay the time until they get

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.810 
definitely delay the time until they get
holes<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> fix<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> holes<00:00:23.640> in

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
holes and be how to fix the holes in

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.009 
holes and be how to fix the holes in
your<00:00:23.910> shoes<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.300> already<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
your shoes that you already have and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.410 
your shoes that you already have and
therefore<00:00:25.560> making<00:00:25.949> them<00:00:26.160> last<00:00:26.369> longer<00:00:26.460> first

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
therefore making them last longer first

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.790 
therefore making them last longer first
let's<00:00:27.630> talk<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:27.779> how<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> prevent<00:00:28.289> holes<00:00:28.650> in

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
let's talk about how to prevent holes in

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
let's talk about how to prevent holes in
the<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.099> place<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> shoe

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the first place here we have a shoe

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.080 
the first place here we have a shoe
skate<00:00:31.560> shoe<00:00:31.740> never<00:00:32.130> been<00:00:32.340> skated<00:00:32.759> or<00:00:32.850> more<00:00:33.030> on

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
skate shoe never been skated or more on

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
skate shoe never been skated or more on
anything<00:00:33.300> brand-new<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> skate

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
anything brand-new and I want to skate

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.069 
anything brand-new and I want to skate
it<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:35.820> want<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> hole<00:00:36.899> in

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it but I don't want it to have a hole in

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
it but I don't want it to have a hole in
like<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.559> weeks<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.129> here's<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.730> got<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
like two weeks so here's what you got to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
like two weeks so here's what you got to
do<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.450> prevent<00:00:39.719> holes<00:00:39.989> all<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.559> need<00:00:40.739> is

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
do to prevent holes all you need is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.970 
do to prevent holes all you need is
superglue<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:42.200> lot<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> people<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.649> worry

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
superglue a lot of people don't worry

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
superglue a lot of people don't worry
about<00:00:44.250> their<00:00:44.399> shoes<00:00:44.640> until<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.120> actually

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
about their shoes until they actually

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
about their shoes until they actually
start<00:00:45.629> getting<00:00:45.780> holes<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.920> big

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
start getting holes which is a big

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
start getting holes which is a big
problem<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.780> too

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
problem because then it's not really too

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
problem because then it's not really too
late<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.160> could<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.460> made<00:00:50.640> your

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
late but it's you could have made your

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
late but it's you could have made your
shoes<00:00:50.940> last<00:00:51.149> longer<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> first<00:00:51.809> place<00:00:52.070> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
shoes last longer in the first place the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
shoes last longer in the first place the
best<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> prevent<00:00:53.820> holes<00:00:54.090> near<00:00:54.360> new<00:00:54.449> shoes

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
best way to prevent holes near new shoes

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.540 
best way to prevent holes near new shoes
is<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.289> superglue<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> carefully

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is to take your superglue and carefully

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
is to take your superglue and carefully
superglue<00:00:57.000> over<00:00:57.270> all<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> seams<00:00:57.809> I'm<00:00:58.289> goofy

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
superglue over all the seams I'm goofy

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
superglue over all the seams I'm goofy
so<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.039> gonna<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.280> doing<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> my<00:00:59.850> right

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
so I'm gonna be doing this on my right

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.790 
so I'm gonna be doing this on my right
shoe<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.960> that's<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> shoe<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.620> gets

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
shoe because that's the shoe that gets

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.950 
shoe because that's the shoe that gets
destroyed<00:01:02.129> first<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.879> I'm<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.660> take

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
destroyed first so I'm gonna do is take

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
destroyed first so I'm gonna do is take
the<00:01:04.080> superglue<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.739> carefully<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:05.820> all

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the superglue and carefully go over all

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.020 
the superglue and carefully go over all
the<00:01:06.119> seams<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.750> rip<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> anywhere

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the seams that would rip so anywhere

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
the seams that would rip so anywhere
where<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> board<00:01:10.020> would<00:01:10.350> come<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.650> talk

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
where the board would come and talk

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.580 
where the board would come and talk
contact<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> shoe<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.869> some

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
contact with the shoe just put some

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.550 
contact with the shoe just put some
superglue<00:01:14.010> covering<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> threads

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
superglue covering all the threads

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.370 
superglue covering all the threads
anywhere<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> shoe<00:01:17.820> ripping<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
anywhere that you see the shoe ripping I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
anywhere that you see the shoe ripping I
like<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.590> put<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> thin<00:01:20.220> layer<00:01:20.450> enough<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like this put a thin layer enough to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.010 
like this put a thin layer enough to
make<00:01:21.810> sort<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> protective<00:01:22.680> shield<00:01:22.950> over<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
make sort of a protective shield over it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
make sort of a protective shield over it
also<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.409> place<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> toe

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
also a good place to do it is on the toe

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
also a good place to do it is on the toe
cap<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.240> that's<00:01:27.509> where<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> lot<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> rips

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
cap because that's where a lot of rips

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
cap because that's where a lot of rips
happen<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.579> along<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> seam

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
happen just put it right along the seam

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.370 
happen just put it right along the seam
there

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.720 

as<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:38.650> see<00:01:38.830> it's<00:01:39.010> almost<00:01:39.250> invisible<00:01:39.640> to

as you can see it's almost invisible to

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.490 
as you can see it's almost invisible to
the<00:01:39.820> human<00:01:39.850> eye<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:40.450> around<00:01:40.690> all<00:01:40.960> these<00:01:41.200> seams

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
the human eye but around all these seams

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.730 
the human eye but around all these seams
here<00:01:41.830> up<00:01:42.730> on<00:01:42.880> top<00:01:43.150> around<00:01:43.660> here<00:01:43.990> on<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.590> toe

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
here up on top around here on the toe

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.710 
here up on top around here on the toe
cap<00:01:44.980> I<00:01:45.160> put<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.370> thin<00:01:45.700> line<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.180> superglue<00:01:46.540> as<00:01:46.690> a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
cap I put a thin line of superglue as a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.320 
cap I put a thin line of superglue as a
protective<00:01:47.200> coat<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.790> that's<00:01:48.970> all<00:01:49.120> you<00:01:49.210> really

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
protective coat so that's all you really

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.490 
protective coat so that's all you really
have<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.540> do<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.840> prevent<00:01:50.020> your<00:01:50.170> new<00:01:50.290> shoes

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
have to do to prevent your new shoes

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.870 
have to do to prevent your new shoes
from<00:01:50.680> developing<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.190> hole<00:01:51.370> just<00:01:51.640> put

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
from developing a hole just put

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.550 
from developing a hole just put
superglue<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:52.330> any<00:01:52.570> seams<00:01:52.930> or<00:01:53.170> anywhere<00:01:53.530> that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
could develop a rip or a tear and the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.180 
could develop a rip or a tear and the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
superglue acts the sort of a shield to

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.610 
superglue acts the sort of a shield to
prevent<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.550> river<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.910> tear<00:01:58.620> obviously

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
prevent the river of the tear obviously

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.020 
prevent the river of the tear obviously
this<00:01:59.710> won't<00:01:59.830> make<00:02:00.010> your<00:02:00.100> shoes<00:02:00.310> last<00:02:00.550> forever

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
this won't make your shoes last forever

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.730 
this won't make your shoes last forever
once<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.450> superglue<00:02:01.780> wears<00:02:02.050> off<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.560> shoes

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
once the superglue wears off the shoes

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.380 
once the superglue wears off the shoes
going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.010> start<00:02:03.190> wearing<00:02:03.370> down<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.180> what<00:02:04.300> you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
going to start wearing down so what you

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.850 
going to start wearing down so what you
can<00:02:04.570> do<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.900> you<00:02:04.990> can<00:02:05.110> either<00:02:05.170> reapply<00:02:05.800> the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
can do is you can either reapply the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.560 
can do is you can either reapply the
superglue<00:02:06.310> if<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:06.640> not<00:02:06.790> formed<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.180> whole<00:02:07.360> yet

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
superglue if it's not formed a whole yet

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.540 
superglue if it's not formed a whole yet
but<00:02:08.050> if<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.229> has<00:02:08.380> formed<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.800> hole<00:02:08.979> then<00:02:09.250> move<00:02:09.429> on

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
but if it has formed a hole then move on

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.370 
but if it has formed a hole then move on
to<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.790> step<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.149> video<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:11.320> I'm

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
to this step of the video so now I'm

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.570 
to this step of the video so now I'm
going<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.560> talk<00:02:11.650> about<00:02:11.770> what<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.100> do<00:02:12.190> once<00:02:12.459> your

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
going to talk about what to do once your

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550 
going to talk about what to do once your
shoe<00:02:12.730> already<00:02:12.940> has<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.240> hole<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.170> what<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.410> need

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
shoe already has a hole so what you need

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.740 
shoe already has a hole so what you need
for<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.160> shoe<00:02:15.670> goo<00:02:15.910> which<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.450> be<00:02:16.540> found

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
for this is shoe goo which can be found

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.449 
for this is shoe goo which can be found
at<00:02:16.900> most<00:02:17.080> local<00:02:17.290> hardware<00:02:17.709> stores<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.280> some

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
at most local hardware stores and some

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.940 
at most local hardware stores and some
skate<00:02:18.730> shops<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:20.110> also<00:02:20.320> helpful<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.830> have

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
skate shops it's also helpful to have

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.800 
skate shops it's also helpful to have
duct<00:02:21.310> tape<00:02:21.490> or<00:02:21.760> any<00:02:21.880> sort<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.150> tape<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.600> block

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
duct tape or any sort of tape to block

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.090 
duct tape or any sort of tape to block
off<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.170> hole<00:02:23.350> when<00:02:23.560> you're<00:02:23.650> applying<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
off the hole when you're applying the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.210 
off the hole when you're applying the
shoe<00:02:24.250> view<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> first<00:02:26.230> step<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.740> taking<00:02:26.980> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
shoe view so the first step is taking a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.680 
shoe view so the first step is taking a
little<00:02:27.340> piece<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.730> duct<00:02:27.910> tape<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.540> big

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
little piece of duct tape just big

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.090 
little piece of duct tape just big
enough<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.900> cover<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.320> hole<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.800> if<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:30.010> this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
enough to cover the hole so if in this

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.520 
enough to cover the hole so if in this
case<00:02:30.160> I'm<00:02:30.490> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.700> let's<00:02:31.570> say<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.320> much

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
case I'm going to let's say that much

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.790 
case I'm going to let's say that much
tape<00:02:33.570> take<00:02:34.570> your<00:02:34.750> tape<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.170> place<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.650> over

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
tape take your tape and place it over

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.440 
tape take your tape and place it over
the<00:02:35.980> hole<00:02:36.280> from<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> inside<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.240> shoe

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
the hole from the inside of the shoe

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.970 
the hole from the inside of the shoe
it's<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> little<00:02:38.440> hard<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.680> get<00:02:38.830> there

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it's a little hard to get there

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.229 
it's a little hard to get there
sometimes<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:39.660> just<00:02:40.660> push<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:42.239> then

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
sometimes but just push it then

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.090 
sometimes but just push it then
sometimes<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.410> showing<00:02:44.739> through

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
sometimes do it showing through

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.949 
sometimes do it showing through
depending<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.550> how<00:02:45.640> big<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.820> hole<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.120> right

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
depending on how big the hole is right

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.540 
depending on how big the hole is right
there<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.200> can<00:02:47.320> tell<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.830> tapes<00:02:48.040> blocking<00:02:48.459> it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
there I can tell the tapes blocking it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.790 
there I can tell the tapes blocking it
off<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.910> what<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.900> does<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.500> prevents

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
off and what this does is it prevents

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.850 
off and what this does is it prevents
the<00:02:50.980> shoe<00:02:51.160> goo<00:02:51.310> from<00:02:51.489> leaking<00:02:51.880> into<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.090> hole

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the shoe goo from leaking into the hole

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.810 
the shoe goo from leaking into the hole
once<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> have<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> hole<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.550> your<00:02:54.640> shoe

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
once you have the hole in your shoe

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.640 
once you have the hole in your shoe
covered<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.330> inside<00:02:55.660> with<00:02:55.840> tape<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.530> want

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
covered on the inside with tape you want

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.710 
covered on the inside with tape you want
to<00:02:56.769> take<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.980> shoe<00:02:57.160> goo<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.610> slowly<00:02:58.269> apply<00:02:58.600> it

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
to take the shoe goo and slowly apply it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.340 
to take the shoe goo and slowly apply it
to<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.989> hole

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
to the hole

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.960 
to the hole
there's<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.070> really<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.610> or<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.880> wrong

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
there's not really a right or a wrong

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
there's not really a right or a wrong
way<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.360> apply<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.840> just<00:03:02.500> put<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.130> on<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.459> hole

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
way to apply it just put it on the hole

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.199 
way to apply it just put it on the hole
around<00:03:05.650> any<00:03:06.340> place<00:03:06.580> that's<00:03:06.760> getting<00:03:06.970> worn

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
around any place that's getting worn

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.960 
around any place that's getting worn
down<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.840> want<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.110> shoe<00:03:08.260> goo<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.650> there

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
down you want the shoe goo to be there

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.490 
down you want the shoe goo to be there
so<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.000> always<00:03:10.239> put<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> hole<00:03:10.959> obviously

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
so I always put it on the hole obviously

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.170 
so I always put it on the hole obviously
I<00:03:11.530> put<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:11.980> some<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.340> old<00:03:12.489> seams<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.030> are

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
I put on some of the old seams that are

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.090 
I put on some of the old seams that are
beginning<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.510> rip<00:03:13.800> don't<00:03:14.800> worry<00:03:14.980> about

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
beginning to rip don't worry about

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.620 
beginning to rip don't worry about
evening<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.550> out<00:03:15.670> anything<00:03:15.940> yet<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.420> comes

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
evening it out anything yet that comes

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.070 
evening it out anything yet that comes
next<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.519> apply<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.549> generous<00:03:19.000> amount<00:03:19.090> because

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
next so apply a generous amount because

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.870 
next so apply a generous amount because
this<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.620> essentially<00:03:21.220> what's<00:03:21.400> saving<00:03:21.760> your

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
this is essentially what's saving your

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.900 
this is essentially what's saving your
shoe<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:23.070> apply<00:03:24.070> anywhere<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.580> think<00:03:24.820> you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
shoe so apply anywhere you think you

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.110 
shoe so apply anywhere you think you
sure<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.180> might<00:03:25.360> need<00:03:25.510> it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.580 

so<00:03:29.120> now<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.330> have<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:29.540> big<00:03:29.810> gloopy<00:03:30.080> mess<00:03:30.409> on

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so now you have this big gloopy mess on

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110 
so now you have this big gloopy mess on
your<00:03:30.620> shoe<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.099> obviously<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.760> doesn't<00:03:31.909> look

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
your shoe and obviously it doesn't look

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.850 
your shoe and obviously it doesn't look
good<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.480> have<00:03:32.720> black<00:03:32.989> shoe<00:03:33.260> goo<00:03:33.439> because<00:03:33.680> my

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
good I have black shoe goo because my

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.740 
good I have black shoe goo because my
shoes<00:03:34.129> black<00:03:34.459> sometimes<00:03:35.209> they<00:03:35.360> make<00:03:35.480> clear

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
shoes black sometimes they make clear

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.420 
shoes black sometimes they make clear
shoe<00:03:35.989> goo<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.379> can<00:03:36.530> get<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:37.280> next

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
shoe goo that you can get to the next

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.399 
shoe goo that you can get to the next
step<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:38.060> take<00:03:38.180> your<00:03:38.329> ice<00:03:38.510> cube<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.049> slowly

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
step is to take your ice cube and slowly

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.319 
step is to take your ice cube and slowly
smooth<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.950> out<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:40.519> with<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.849> ice<00:03:40.970> cube

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
smooth it out so here with the ice cube

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.500 
smooth it out so here with the ice cube
just<00:03:42.110> run<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.799> over<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.250> shoe<00:03:43.430> qu<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:43.909> what

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
just run it over to the shoe qu and what

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.509 
just run it over to the shoe qu and what
this<00:03:44.659> does<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.709> don't<00:03:45.950> know<00:03:46.099> what<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.400> is

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
this does is I don't know what it is

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.000 
this does is I don't know what it is
about<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.849> ice<00:03:46.909> cube<00:03:47.269> but<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.440> doesn't<00:03:48.799> stick

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
about the ice cube but it doesn't stick

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.649 
about the ice cube but it doesn't stick
to<00:03:49.159> the<00:03:49.190> shoe<00:03:49.400> goo<00:03:49.549> at<00:03:49.670> all<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.269> allows<00:03:50.510> you

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
to the shoe goo at all so it allows you

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.050 
to the shoe goo at all so it allows you
to<00:03:50.750> evenly<00:03:51.079> smooth<00:03:51.409> it<00:03:51.530> out<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:52.519> run<00:03:52.940> it

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
to evenly smooth it out so just run it

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.740 
to evenly smooth it out so just run it
all<00:03:53.180> around<00:03:53.480> until<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:55.280> shoe<00:03:55.489> goo<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.819> smooth

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
all around until your shoe goo is smooth

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.349 
all around until your shoe goo is smooth
and<00:03:57.049> spread<00:03:57.409> thin<00:03:57.680> around<00:03:57.829> any<00:03:58.549> holes<00:03:59.090> or

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
and spread thin around any holes or

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.339 
and spread thin around any holes or
tearing<00:03:59.690> parts<00:04:01.510> make<00:04:02.510> sure<00:04:02.659> to<00:04:02.780> get<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.989> edges

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
tearing parts make sure to get the edges

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.470 
tearing parts make sure to get the edges
a<00:04:03.379> lot<00:04:03.620> where<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.549> shoe<00:04:04.730> goo<00:04:04.879> ends<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.359> meets

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
a lot where the shoe goo ends and meets

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.030 
a lot where the shoe goo ends and meets
the<00:04:05.629> shoe<00:04:05.810> make<00:04:06.079> sure<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.290> flatten<00:04:06.500> those<00:04:06.799> down

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
the shoe make sure to flatten those down

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.849 
the shoe make sure to flatten those down
so<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.730> shoe<00:04:07.879> goo<00:04:08.030> doesn't<00:04:08.299> peel<00:04:08.480> off<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.739> now

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
so the shoe goo doesn't peel off so now

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.009 
so the shoe goo doesn't peel off so now
the<00:04:12.920> shoe<00:04:13.159> goo<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.459> all<00:04:13.579> spread<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.629> smoothed

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
the shoe goo is all spread and smoothed

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.340 
the shoe goo is all spread and smoothed
out<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:17.389> duct<00:04:17.570> tape<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.900> still<00:04:18.109> on<00:04:18.260> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
out and the duct tape is still on the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.930 
out and the duct tape is still on the
inside<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.889> hole<00:04:19.070> right<00:04:19.250> there<00:04:19.489> it's

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
inside of the hole right there it's

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.400 
inside of the hole right there it's
preventing<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.539> sugar<00:04:20.780> from<00:04:20.930> leaking<00:04:21.139> in

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
preventing the sugar from leaking in

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.020 
preventing the sugar from leaking in
don't<00:04:21.769> take<00:04:21.949> the<00:04:22.039> duct<00:04:22.190> tape<00:04:22.430> out<00:04:22.610> until<00:04:22.910> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
don't take the duct tape out until the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.129 
don't take the duct tape out until the
shoes<00:04:23.210> dried<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:26.150> then<00:04:26.300> all<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.720> is<00:04:26.900> you

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
shoes dried so then all you do is you

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:27.760 
shoes dried so then all you do is you
take<00:04:27.289> your<00:04:27.350> shoe

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
take your shoe

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.520 
take your shoe
set<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.580> down<00:04:28.610> preferably<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.479> Sun<00:04:29.720> let<00:04:30.440> it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
set it down preferably in the Sun let it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.589 
set it down preferably in the Sun let it
sit<00:04:30.740> for<00:04:30.770> 24<00:04:31.039> hours<00:04:31.610> until<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.150> shoes<00:04:32.330> fully

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
sit for 24 hours until the shoes fully

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.510 
sit for 24 hours until the shoes fully
dried<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.410> could<00:04:33.740> take<00:04:33.979> more<00:04:34.190> if<00:04:34.370> you're

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
dried it could take more if you're

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.460 
dried it could take more if you're
living<00:04:34.639> in<00:04:34.849> like<00:04:35.000> cold<00:04:35.270> rainy<00:04:35.539> weather<00:04:35.780> could

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
living in like cold rainy weather could

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.529 
living in like cold rainy weather could
take<00:04:36.620> less<00:04:36.860> if<00:04:37.039> it's<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.190> nice<00:04:37.340> sunny<00:04:37.580> day<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:38.300> I

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
take less if it's a nice sunny day so I

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.240 
take less if it's a nice sunny day so I
usually<00:04:38.960> let<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.139> sit<00:04:39.289> for<00:04:39.410> 24<00:04:39.770> hours<00:04:40.039> just<00:04:40.190> to

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
usually let it sit for 24 hours just to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.129 
usually let it sit for 24 hours just to
make<00:04:40.370> sure<00:04:40.400> it's<00:04:40.669> safe<00:04:40.880> once<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.870> shoe<00:04:42.020> is

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
make sure it's safe once the shoe is

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.930 
make sure it's safe once the shoe is
dried<00:04:42.380> just<00:04:42.680> go<00:04:42.830> on<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.010> inside<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.550> peel<00:04:43.789> out

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
dried just go on the inside and peel out
