00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
guys think about that but honestly I

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.090 
guys think about that but honestly I
think<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.369> it's<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.869> know<00:01:19.990> co-op<00:01:20.470> for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
think that it's just you know co-op for

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.770 
think that it's just you know co-op for
instance<00:01:21.520> it's<00:01:21.909> only<00:01:22.090> gonna<00:01:22.240> be<00:01:22.390> two<00:01:22.570> player

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
instance it's only gonna be two player

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.899 
instance it's only gonna be two player
co-op<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:23.290> last<00:01:23.590> gen<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.070> it's<00:01:24.369> gonna<00:01:24.490> be<00:01:24.640> four

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
co-op on last gen and it's gonna be four

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.730 
co-op on last gen and it's gonna be four
player<00:01:25.150> co-op<00:01:25.240> on<00:01:25.689> next<00:01:26.140> gen<00:01:26.290> so<00:01:26.409> that's<00:01:26.590> what

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
player co-op on next gen so that's what

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.289 
player co-op on next gen so that's what
I'm<00:01:26.860> thinking<00:01:27.159> it<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.369> but<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.640> could<00:01:27.670> be<00:01:27.880> the

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
I'm thinking it is but it could be the

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.820 
I'm thinking it is but it could be the
touchpad<00:01:28.540> could<00:01:28.960> be<00:01:29.049> used<00:01:29.229> for<00:01:29.409> something<00:01:29.590> we

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
touchpad could be used for something we

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.960 
touchpad could be used for something we
don't<00:01:29.920> know<00:01:30.100> like<00:01:30.250> functions<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:30.700> little

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
don't know like functions this little

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.160 
don't know like functions this little
touchpad<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.540> guys<00:01:31.659> are<00:01:31.810> seeing<00:01:31.990> on
