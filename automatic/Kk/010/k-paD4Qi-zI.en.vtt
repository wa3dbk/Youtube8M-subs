don't go outside like I did and usually

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.800 
don't go outside like I did and usually
that<00:03:30.820> would<00:03:30.910> be<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> stupid<00:03:31.269> dissonant

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
that would be a stupid dissonant

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.120 
that would be a stupid dissonant
decision<00:03:32.290> especially<00:03:32.500> if<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.769> played<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.100> on

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
overkill so yeah just um just escape

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.979 
overkill so yeah just um just escape
really<00:03:37.630> that's<00:03:37.959> all<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.530> need<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.769> do<00:03:42.840> for<00:03:43.840> me

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989
