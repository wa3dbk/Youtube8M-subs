practical it's not I'm all about

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
practical it's not I'm all about
efficiency<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.710> good<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.159> makes

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
efficiency if it's if it's good it makes

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
efficiency if it's if it's good it makes
my<00:01:35.490> life<00:01:35.640> more<00:01:35.880> simple<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.960> freakin<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.069 
thing I like about this is that I can
put<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.270> protein<00:01:48.720> after<00:01:48.899> my

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
put it in and have my protein after my

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.389 
put it in and have my protein after my
workout<00:01:49.470> part<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.310> cup<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.189> not

workout part of my cup but it's not

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.770 
workout part of my cup but it's not
really<00:01:53.640> useful<00:01:53.759> I'd<00:01:54.000> rather<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.450> bring<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
really useful I'd rather just bring a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
really useful I'd rather just bring a
baggie<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.290> something<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.829> put<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.219> here

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
baggie or something and put it in here

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
baggie or something and put it in here

I always feel like I'm filling this up

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
I always feel like I'm filling this up
more<00:02:08.520> than<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.840> blender<00:02:10.140> bottle

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
more than if I take the blender bottle
