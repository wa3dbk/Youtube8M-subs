00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.150
 One in the following pictures one might think it is the Manex now 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.910
 really parcours athletes because of themselves so through the city as there is 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.109
 no obstacles just overcome 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.519
 And Parkour is so trendy that even the new James Bond Daniel Craig is now 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 is trimmed to the obstacle runner and in Berlin 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.350
 Everyone could learn that now because the elite of pop group professionals has to 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.350
 Trial training invited Aigner goes to the report 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.929
 for them the way over the wall is not a shortcut to the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.149
 last bus to get well that's recreational sport 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.550
 called Parkour 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.820
 Sandra 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.590
 Stephen and Moses live almost every obstacle on a narrow 4 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.710
 spray pike over concrete canyons and have a lot of fun 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 the pre-installed concert locomotion 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 Fisher without any aids 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.310
 Bensheim 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.540
 it was easy to move everything too fast 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.210
 concrete reasons for this and remain in office 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 No more a restriction should be a possibility 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.670
 The city's cliff divers they for such jumps have the parking meter 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.140
 Runner trained for a long time 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.330
 the sport comes from France 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.180
 and he is the inventor 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.410
 since the source of the pro has been several times for spectacular scenes in 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.800
 Cinematographic films also set an example for the Germans 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.910
 I know that it was said that the first time loading began again as 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.860
 five years ago 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.799
 that's a whole 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.799
 I really do not need something 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.400
 trained with him 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.190
 specifically that you can almost bitterly make his jumps 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.390
 Exactly and now there is a great opportunity for all who want to become so good 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.120
 because the master from France has traveled to Berlin especially too 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.140
 Bring beginners the modern obstacle course 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.380
 in a converted hall 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.359
 for the beginner is and how relatively easy going on but now 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 you can see the seagulls and the vastness of the internet in office 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.569
 this is also noticeable as she starts to jump on the meter-high wooden box 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.819
 Ottilie crew though the jump but also the pole keep the balance that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 he does not succeed 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.479
 who is so easy to knight all the time 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.809
 but at least he is careful 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.769
 unlike some others 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.769
 which simply underestimates the obstacles 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.399
 Coach Steve McClaren the 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:41.349
 You need to 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.439
 negligence 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.569
 Christmas negligence too, people maybe they are old 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.059
 at least pain cost of a choice 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.639
 Prime Office lesson 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.439
 he is mine 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.600
 and that's what actor Daniel Craig has learned 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.810
 he too has taken lessons as a new James Bond instructor in the course 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.779
 David Bell is proud of that 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.889
 to be mad at the company 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.489
 the bigger me that i should when than i have seen others except 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.720
 can learn me Parkour 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.670
 Although I do not know her motivation for not leading her that way 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.560
 Class if it already needs the intelligence services as a coach around 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.839
 Parkour to learn 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.999
 Jan Marco Thines have now completed their lesson 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.999
 They want to go outside tomorrow 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.829
 Reason contradiction among the professionals from Nidda have got 7000 spectators 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 but in a lively 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.339
 and maybe they too soon meet such artists in the 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:36.779
 Urban jungle 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.529
 do not worry because these people are just trying to play 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.149
 Robert f 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:46.489
 that can only be a hollywood star
