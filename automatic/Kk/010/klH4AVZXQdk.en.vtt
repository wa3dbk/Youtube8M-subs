open<00:02:45.880> here<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.780> keyring<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.280> boots<00:02:48.519> got<00:02:48.730> a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
open here on the keyring the boots got a

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.860 
open here on the keyring the boots got a
very<00:02:49.209> high<00:02:49.420> floor<00:02:49.800> most<00:02:50.800> them<00:02:51.070> they<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.690> can

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
very high floor most them they you can

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.140 
very high floor most them they you can
see<00:02:52.900> how<00:02:53.260> high<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.500> floor<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.820> doesn't<00:02:54.970> go

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
see how high the floor is it doesn't go

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.840 
see how high the floor is it doesn't go
back<00:02:55.360> very<00:02:55.569> far<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:57.550> here<00:02:59.100> and<00:03:00.100> as<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.519> can<00:03:00.580> see

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
back very far in here and as you can see

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.699 
back very far in here and as you can see
because<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.269> kind<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.480> got<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> sporty

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
because it's kind of got the sporty

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.880 
because it's kind of got the sporty
shape<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:04.030> got<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.269> rake<00:03:04.600> here<00:03:04.989> where<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
shape you got this rake here where the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.750 
shape you got this rake here where the
windscreen<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.420> doesn't<00:03:07.660> allow<00:03:07.750> you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
windscreen is and it doesn't allow you

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
much room in the boot but otherwise it's

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.759 
much room in the boot but otherwise it's
a<00:03:12.580> good<00:03:12.730> car<00:03:13.000> because<00:03:13.480> 33<00:03:13.900> miles<00:03:14.290> per<00:03:14.470> gallon

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
and in the real world it does that not

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.890 
and in the real world it does that not
just<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.350> clean<00:03:17.560> figure<00:03:18.060> I've<00:03:19.060> been<00:03:19.239> pretty

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
just a clean figure I've been pretty

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.490 
just a clean figure I've been pretty

this car of the qx70 yes sir it's a good
car<00:03:27.220> I'm<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.299> sure<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:28.690> feels<00:03:28.900> special

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
car I'm not sure if it feels special

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.020 
car I'm not sure if it feels special
enough<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:30.360> 44,000<00:03:31.360> pounds<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:33.030> it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
enough for 44,000 pounds but it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.770 
enough for 44,000 pounds but it
certainly<00:03:35.130> handles<00:03:36.130> better<00:03:36.400> than<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.480> lot<00:03:37.630> of

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
certainly handles better than a lot of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.360 
certainly handles better than a lot of
TVs<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.299> road<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.720> its<00:03:40.900> ps2<00:03:41.739> resistance

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
TVs on the road is its ps2 resistance

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.960 
TVs on the road is its ps2 resistance
and<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.980> let<00:03:45.130> down<00:03:45.280> slightly<00:03:45.549> on<00:03:45.730> some

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
and it's let down slightly on some

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.599 
and it's let down slightly on some
practical<00:03:46.680> practicality<00:03:47.680> areas<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:48.430> it's

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
practical practicality areas but it's

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.870 
practical practicality areas but it's
it's<00:03:48.940> over<00:03:49.209> always<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.420> good<00:03:49.630> car
