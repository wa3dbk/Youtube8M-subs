00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
within three months I think that's been

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.470

the most remarkable thing about this
whole<00:01:24.660> thing<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.230> that<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.680> player

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
whole thing I think that just one player

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.290 
whole thing I think that just one player
because<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.280> throughout<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.180> have

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
because I think throughout when you have

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.470 
because I think throughout when you have
success<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.870> think<00:01:28.160> certain<00:01:29.160> guys<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
success I think certain guys will you

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.650 
success I think certain guys will you
know<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.810> gotta<00:01:31.080> have<00:01:31.230> impact<00:01:31.650> games<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.660> they

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
know I gotta have impact games that they

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.540 
know I gotta have impact games that they
move<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> forward<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.770> team<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.430> than

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
move you forward as a team but more than

move you forward as a team but more than
anything<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.660> group

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
anything I think it's just the group

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.280 
short time that we can build a team that
everyone's<00:01:45.240> focused<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.900> common<00:01:46.260> goal

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
everyone's focused on one common goal

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.910 
everyone's focused on one common goal
and<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> most<00:01:48.420> important<00:01:48.810> thing<00:01:48.920> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
and that's the most important thing that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.630 
and that's the most important thing that
I<00:01:49.950> feel<00:01:50.360> good<00:01:51.360> about<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.870> moment<00:01:52.080> now<00:01:52.640> we

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
I feel good about at this moment now we

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.100 
I feel good about at this moment now we
have<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> long<00:01:54.000> season<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.570> almost<00:01:54.750> feels<00:01:54.990> like

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
have a long season I almost feels like

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.540 
have a long season I almost feels like
everything<00:01:55.620> is<00:01:55.710> over<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.400> it's

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
everything is over but it's not it's

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.340 
everything is over but it's not it's
just<00:01:56.730> beginning<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.120> us<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.900> only<00:01:58.050> played

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
just beginning for us we only played

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.560 
just beginning for us we only played
four<00:01:58.590> games<00:01:58.830> there's<00:01:59.730> a<00:01:59.850> lot<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.030> room<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.300> make

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
four games there's a lot of room to make

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.870 
four games there's a lot of room to make
because<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:01.050> do<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.350> high<00:02:02.010> expectations<00:02:02.370> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
because we do have high expectations and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420 
because we do have high expectations and
goals<00:02:02.940> for<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.480> season<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.190> now<00:02:05.190> it's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
goals for the season and now it's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
goals for the season and now it's
important<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.840> quickly<00:02:07.080> we<00:02:07.560> try<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
important that really quickly we try to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.499 
important that really quickly we try to
put<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.159> behind<00:02:08.340> us<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.940> learn<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
put this behind us and we learn from it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.120 
put this behind us and we learn from it
you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.960> you<00:02:10.229> playing<00:02:10.500> games<00:02:10.740> like<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
you know you playing games like this

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.370 
you know you playing games like this
under<00:02:11.460> stressful<00:02:11.730> situations<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:13.050> makes<00:02:13.290> you

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
under stressful situations it makes you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.809 
under stressful situations it makes you
better<00:02:13.560> as<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.770> team<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.220> I

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
better as a team and I

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.199 
better as a team and I
think<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:17.280> games<00:02:17.549> would<00:02:17.760> definitely<00:02:18.120> help

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
think this games would definitely help

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.339 
think this games would definitely help
us<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:22.590> our<00:02:23.040> goal<00:02:23.249> to<00:02:23.400> try<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:24.209> achieve<00:02:24.359> the

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
us in our goal to try to achieve the

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.790 
us in our goal to try to achieve the
things<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.709> we've<00:02:25.829> set<00:02:26.040> forth<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.370> MLS
