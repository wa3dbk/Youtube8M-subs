00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.670 
I'm going to take my channel locks and
reinstall<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.690> permanent<00:02:28.080> tension<00:02:28.410> spring

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
reinstall the permanent tension spring

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.759 
reinstall the permanent tension spring
clamp<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:30.019> as<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.320> see<00:02:31.380> there's<00:02:31.709> a

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
clamp now as you can see there's a

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.250 
clamp now as you can see there's a
pattern<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.760> hose<00:02:33.000> for<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.450> clamp<00:02:33.780> has

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
pattern on this hose for the clamp has

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.680 
pattern on this hose for the clamp has
been<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.070> entire<00:02:35.340> life<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.910> vehicle<00:02:36.060> more

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
been the entire life of the vehicle more

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.350 
been the entire life of the vehicle more
than<00:02:36.840> likely<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.890> hose<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.670> used<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.180> being

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
than likely that hose is used to being

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.900 
than likely that hose is used to being
in<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.810> position<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.530> really<00:02:41.489> wants<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> be

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
in that position and really wants to be

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.789 
in that position and really wants to be
back<00:02:42.239> in<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.690> position<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.470> we're<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
back in that position so we're going to

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.729 
back in that position so we're going to
do<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.070> line<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.370> our<00:02:44.670> hose<00:02:44.910> clamp<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
do is line up our hose clamp with the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.430 
do is line up our hose clamp with the
pattern<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.660> will<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.110> do<00:02:52.230> some

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
pattern on it you will have to do some

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.199 
pattern on it you will have to do some
wiggling<00:02:52.829> they<00:02:53.250> don't<00:02:53.430> give<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> lot<00:02:54.060> of

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
wiggling they don't give you a lot of

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.060 
wiggling they don't give you a lot of
extra<00:02:54.540> space<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.200> permanent<00:02:55.470> tension

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
extra space on a permanent tension

extra space on a permanent tension
spring<00:02:56.549> clamp

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.730 

what<00:03:03.570> I'm<00:03:03.690> doing<00:03:03.960> now<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.110> lining<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
what I'm doing now is lining up the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.310 
what I'm doing now is lining up the
pattern<00:03:05.160> with<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.400> hose<00:03:05.730> clamp<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
pattern with the hose clamp and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.320 
pattern with the hose clamp and
releasing<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.320> once<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.950> place<00:03:08.330> right

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
releasing it once it's in place right

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.180 
releasing it once it's in place right
there<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.740> proper<00:03:14.010> service

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
there and that is the proper service

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.820 
there and that is the proper service
procedure<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:15.180> reconnecting<00:03:16.080> your<00:03:16.380> overflow
