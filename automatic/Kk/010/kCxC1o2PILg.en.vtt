00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.780
 Hello, today we will deal with 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.330
 Assembling our Jim Ida will build bridges 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.210
 let's assemble the camera box install the motor 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 there are so many cogs here but 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 not everyone here is still an extra package 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.770
 gears on the box actually let's 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.990
 let's get going first build bridges 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.880
 both and then we will deal with the box 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.530
 installing a motor on it so bridges 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.530
 here of course with bearings 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:01:01.450
 and so now we set up workshops in 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:08.140
 fist holder bearing and second 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.830
 fist holder so now let's 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.880
 set 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.390
 large gear remains in the center 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.310
 there are no differentials 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.140
 drive here are different lengths so you need 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.710
 see what instructions where 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.500
 put 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:35.590
 and so basically everything is collected all 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 spinning now add from the womb again 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.170
 as this will castrol lmx greens and 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.280
 all this on the perimeter we coat 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.280
 sealant to prevent water from entering 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:08.350
 we wipe the whole thing and get down to 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.830
 fists well in fists naturally too 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:19.050
 bearings are getting inserted into the workshop 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.050
 would fasten on two screws 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.159
 so all one bridge is ready this is the front one 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:35.290
 as we see here fists 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:39.220
 installed everything turns everything works 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.170
 Now let 's build the suspension 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.629
 accordingly, the instructions write to us 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.500
 what is the suspension how many plates 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.140
 need to put 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 and that in the end we get to soft 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.409
 standard hard time 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.680
 Well, I do not know that there is someone that but I want 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.099
 soft suspension so I will insert 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.099
 soft 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.270
 So on the first bridge and spring 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.760
 installed as saying software but of course 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.440
 not super soft ie before suspension on 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.810
 tags here will be a little bit far 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.490
 Dubova and now we are engaged in the second bridge 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.790
 set serva sulfur removed from 100 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.209
 pen therefore will not be super yes super not 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.770
 super cool so take two thrust steering 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.770
 also going to night all according to the instructions 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.709
 so fasten the pad for gray to 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.560
 our bridge 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:10.930
 only two screws are holding the pad 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.489
 installed and sergo on four screws 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.489
 so it will be attached 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.210
 and now let's do the assembly boxes on it 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.080
 I will install a motor 35 turns 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.990
 Saturn 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.050
 Well, let's say something average, I think 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.050
 enough 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.930
 So we add lubricants to the box, but here 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.940
 it needs a little bit because the box 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:19.540
 will be directly connected with om pionon and 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:21.840
 everything will be open and all around the perimeter 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.470
 we coat with sealant again to 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 protect from water 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.640
 now take the bases for the box here 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:48.520
 See which design is the best ah yes 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:50.830
 there will be 4 wheels below and if we 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.890
 somewhere we will sit on the center there and theoretically 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.330
 we can drive and now the box 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.330
 set on the basis of 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.120
 and so now we undertake a motor 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.280
 set a pignon on it 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:12.220
 Pignon was included and fastened to 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:21.099
 our boxes do not forget to exhibit 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:22.870
 the gap well here and so somewhere is enough like me 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:28.960
 say 15-20 percent 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:30.819
 tooth lengths leave and now us 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.699
 it remains to close the last cover 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:41.050
 Again, we coat with sealant so as not to 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:42.789
 water all fell 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.169
 accordingly the box is collected 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:50.699
 motor installed front axle 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:54.340
 assembled here we have installed sergo 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:57.180
 gray now we check you can not 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.009
 connecting to the receiver take sergo tester 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.419
 servo tester connect 4 fingertips 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:06.669
 battery and rotate well as we see 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:12.340
 everything works no problem neither 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:14.139
 snacking anything is very simple 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.330
 check without any receivers 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.520
 useful stuff really will not need 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.190
 bother with connecting heaps 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.360
 wires 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.319
 actually here and so the assembly took 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.580
 somewhere of the order of two hours let's say this and 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.940
 the next series will collect all 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.940
 rest
