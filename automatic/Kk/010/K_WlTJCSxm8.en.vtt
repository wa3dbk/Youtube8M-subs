00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
the ipsw and you would have to locate

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.460 
the ipsw and you would have to locate
that<00:01:32.680> ipsw<00:01:34.299> so<00:01:35.299> that's<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.630> only<00:01:35.690> time<00:01:36.080> given

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
that ipsw so that's the only time given

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.530 
that ipsw so that's the only time given
the<00:01:36.560> fact<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.100> iOS<00:01:37.490> 5<00:01:37.700> betas<00:01:38.150> are<00:01:38.299> not

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
the fact that the iOS 5 betas are not

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.109 
the fact that the iOS 5 betas are not
public<00:01:39.140> they're<00:01:39.409> still<00:01:39.650> private<00:01:40.369> that's<00:01:40.880> why

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
public they're still private that's why

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.359 
public they're still private that's why
you<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.780> do<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.950> only<00:01:43.100> those

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
you have to do that so the only those

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.100 
you have to do that so the only those
two<00:01:43.400> options<00:01:44.060> out<00:01:44.240> there<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.659> we're<00:01:44.840> going<00:01:45.020> to

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
two options out there so we're going to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.260 
two options out there so we're going to
go<00:01:45.200> into<00:01:45.380> extra<00:01:45.830> since<00:01:46.280> jailbreak<00:01:46.760> i<00:01:46.909> already

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
go into extra since jailbreak i already

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.359 
go into extra since jailbreak i already
cover<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.750> just<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:48.409> when<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.740> extras

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369

cover that just now so when the extras
now<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.780> see<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.049> have<00:01:51.200> just

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
now and as you can see you have just

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.010 
now and as you can see you have just
boot<00:01:51.920> tethered<00:01:52.400> right<00:01:52.640> now<00:01:52.909> that<00:01:53.540> are<00:01:53.570> that

boot tethered right now that are that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.840 
boot tethered right now that are that
option<00:01:54.560> might<00:01:54.710> look<00:01:54.950> familiar<00:01:55.159> that's<00:01:55.670> when

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
option might look familiar that's when

server the query option is i think
that's<00:04:18.510> also<00:04:18.810> for<00:04:19.260> checking<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.830> but<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.370> use

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
that's also for checking to but you use

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.810 
that's also for checking to but you use
your<00:04:20.910> EC<00:04:21.450> ID<00:04:21.720> number<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.890> check<00:04:22.920> for<00:04:23.610> your

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
your EC ID number to check for your

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.620 
your EC ID number to check for your
blobs

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.220 
hit boom see like that random photo they
met<00:06:11.670> but<00:06:11.850> you<00:06:11.970> it<00:06:12.180> looks<00:06:12.390> like<00:06:12.540> you<00:06:12.690> have<00:06:12.720> to<00:06:13.080> be

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
met but you it looks like you have to be

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.130 
met but you it looks like you have to be
in<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:14.100> dimension<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.700> has<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:15.060> be<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.240> 320<00:06:15.930> x

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
in the dimension it has to be a 320 x

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.370 
in the dimension it has to be a 320 x
480<00:06:16.880> so<00:06:17.880> you<00:06:17.970> can<00:06:18.210> see<00:06:18.390> my<00:06:18.570> picture<00:06:18.990> was<00:06:19.170> not

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
480 so you can see my picture was not

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.650 
480 so you can see my picture was not
compatible<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:20.670> that's<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.240> low<00:06:21.420> but

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
compatible and and that's the low but

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.030 
compatible and and that's the low but
actually<00:06:21.960> going<00:06:22.140> to<00:06:22.260> see<00:06:22.440> when<00:06:22.620> you<00:06:22.770> boot<00:06:23.010> your

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
actually going to see when you boot your

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.360 
actually going to see when you boot your
device<00:06:23.550> kettle<00:06:24.030> which<00:06:24.210> is<00:06:24.390> cool<00:06:24.690> this<00:06:25.650> ecid

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
device kettle which is cool this ecid

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.250 
device kettle which is cool this ecid
