about<00:01:40.350> creating<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.829> biggest<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.310> best<00:01:41.460> game

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
about creating the biggest and best game

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.310 
about creating the biggest and best game
it's<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.180> learning<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.689> process<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's about learning the process of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's about learning the process of
creating<00:01:43.649> game<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> working<00:01:44.670> together

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
creating game and working together

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.450 
creating game and working together
cohesively<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.810> team<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.470> dev<00:01:46.649> side<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
cohesively as a team the dev side of it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
cohesively as a team the dev side of it
and<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.820> program<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> programmers<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and the program like the programmers and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.450 
and the program like the programmers and
the<00:01:49.170> artists<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.560> come<00:01:49.710> together<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.310> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the artists they come together and we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100 
the artists they come together and we
all<00:01:50.579> make<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> game<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> its<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.720> finding

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
all make a game and its really finding

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660 
all make a game and its really finding
that<00:01:52.229> cohesive<00:01:52.619> bond<00:01:52.979> between<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> two

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that cohesive bond between the two

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
that cohesive bond between the two
different<00:01:53.970> types<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> personalities<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
different types of personalities on that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.410 
different types of personalities on that
really<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.790> come<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.240> life

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
really make this really come to life

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
really make this really come to life
ness<00:01:57.930> quest<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.439> believe<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:59.399> came

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
ness quest I believe really came

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.190 
ness quest I believe really came
together<00:01:59.820> even<00:02:00.420> though<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> game<00:02:01.020> was

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
together even though that the game was

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.690 
together even though that the game was
sliced<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> things

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
sliced and there was a lot of things

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160 
sliced and there was a lot of things
that<00:02:02.969> really<00:02:03.149> need<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.540> come<00:02:03.810> from<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> game

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
that really need to be come from a game

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.289 
that really need to be come from a game
because<00:02:04.320> they<00:02:04.500> weren't<00:02:04.680> working<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.490> work

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
because they weren't working we work

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.670 
because they weren't working we work
with<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> dev<00:02:07.049> team<00:02:07.290> did<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> really

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
with it and a dev team did a really

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.770 
with it and a dev team did a really
spectacular<00:02:07.950> job<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.239> one<00:02:09.390> thing<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
spectacular job and the one thing that I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
spectacular job and the one thing that I
really<00:02:09.810> want<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> point<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.310> fact

they're building their engines from

that<00:02:24.300> already<00:02:24.900> exist<00:02:25.350> these<00:02:25.800> guys<00:02:26.100> are

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that already exist these guys are

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.070 
that already exist these guys are
building<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.030> engine<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.540> scratch<00:02:27.870> from

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
building the engine from scratch from

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
building the engine from scratch from
the<00:02:28.230> rendering<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.280> collision<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.180> every

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the rendering to the collision to every

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
the rendering to the collision to every
single<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.900> makes<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.470> engine

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
single thing that makes up this engine

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.530 
single thing that makes up this engine
including<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.580> exporters<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.150> everything

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
including the exporters and everything

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
including the exporters and everything
else<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.350> within<00:02:34.530> five<00:02:34.860> months

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
else and this is all within five months

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.980 
else and this is all within five months
so<00:02:35.850> these<00:02:35.970> guys<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.390> put<00:02:36.660> their<00:02:36.810> all<00:02:36.840> into

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
so these guys really put their all into

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.690 
so these guys really put their all into
this<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.650> honestly<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.280> believe<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
this and honestly I believe that

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.280 
this and honestly I believe that
everything<00:02:39.060> came<00:02:39.330> together<00:02:39.510> at<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> end<00:02:39.960> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
everything came together at the end and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.290 
everything came together at the end and
I'm<00:02:40.950> telling<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.430> I'll<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:41.700> honest<00:02:42.120> there

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
I'm telling you I'll be honest there

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.700 
I'm telling you I'll be honest there
were<00:02:42.390> times<00:02:42.630> where<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.870> was<00:02:42.990> really<00:02:43.230> worried<00:02:43.530> I

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
were times where I was really worried I

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.810 
were times where I was really worried I
thought<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.160> development<00:02:44.610> team<00:02:44.640> was

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
thought that the development team was

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.280 
thought that the development team was
going<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.120> fired<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.510> couple<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.810> times<00:02:45.960> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
going to get fired a couple of times I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.230 
going to get fired a couple of times I
thought<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.460> game<00:02:47.610> wasn't<00:02:47.940> really

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
thought that like the game wasn't really

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.730 
thought that like the game wasn't really
coming<00:02:48.510> out<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.810> what<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.020> had<00:02:49.230> expected

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
coming out to what I had expected

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.070 
coming out to what I had expected
because<00:02:50.430> my<00:02:50.670> expectations<00:02:51.450> were<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.840> high

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
because my expectations were so high

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.840 
because my expectations were so high
because<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.590> really<00:02:52.920> want<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.220> go<00:02:53.340> into<00:02:53.490> final

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
because I really want to go into final

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.250 
because I really want to go into final
project<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.390> really<00:02:54.570> make<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.990> most

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
project and really make the most

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.710 
project and really make the most
spectacular<00:02:55.530> game<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.520> really<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.480> it's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
spectacular game and really it's it's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.800 
spectacular game and really it's it's
students<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:59.010> learn<00:02:59.220> we<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.540> learned

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
students that just learn we just learned

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.540 
students that just learn we just learned
how<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.960> do<00:03:01.140> everything<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.740> having<00:03:02.400> my

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
how to do everything so having my

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.310 
how to do everything so having my
aspirations<00:03:03.120> set<00:03:03.300> really<00:03:03.600> high<00:03:03.630> was<00:03:03.990> probably

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
aspirations set really high was probably

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.990 
aspirations set really high was probably
the<00:03:04.440> biggest<00:03:04.590> mistake<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.130> made<00:03:05.310> for<00:03:05.430> myself<00:03:05.610> is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the biggest mistake I made for myself is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.690 
the biggest mistake I made for myself is

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
because I expected so much more and I

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.310 
because I expected so much more and I
think<00:03:09.120> everybody<00:03:09.480> else<00:03:09.660> expected<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.260> much

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
more from our game too it's just we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.340
