many<00:00:00.690> people<00:00:00.870> think<00:00:01.230> self-driving<00:00:02.159> cars<00:00:02.520> are

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
many people think self-driving cars are

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.940 
many people think self-driving cars are
science<00:00:03.120> fiction<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.350> reality<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:04.859> that

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
science fiction but the reality is that

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.130 
science fiction but the reality is that
already<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:05.670> we're<00:00:06.089> testing<00:00:06.330> self-driving

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
already today we're testing self-driving

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.259 
already today we're testing self-driving
cars<00:00:07.470> like<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> one<00:00:07.950> behind<00:00:08.130> me<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.940> real

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
cars like the one behind me in real

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.009 
cars like the one behind me in real
traffic<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.870> roads<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.650> Gothenburg<00:00:11.130> Sweden

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.750 

so<00:00:15.589> right<00:00:15.769> now<00:00:15.799> we're<00:00:16.160> in<00:00:16.189> the<00:00:16.309> prototype

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
so right now we're in the prototype

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.510 
so right now we're in the prototype
vehicle<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:17.380> we're<00:00:18.380> driving<00:00:18.470> in<00:00:19.039> Gothenburg

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
vehicle and we're driving in Gothenburg

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.130 
vehicle and we're driving in Gothenburg
on<00:00:19.759> the<00:00:19.939> typical<00:00:20.359> road<00:00:20.480> that<00:00:20.660> a<00:00:20.689> lot<00:00:20.869> of<00:00:20.900> people

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
on the typical road that a lot of people

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.519 
on the typical road that a lot of people
use<00:00:21.710> for<00:00:21.919> their<00:00:22.099> daily<00:00:22.220> commuting<00:00:22.759> and<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:24.380> can

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
use for their daily commuting and I can

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.769 
use for their daily commuting and I can
show<00:00:24.650> how<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.829> activated<00:00:25.340> system<00:00:25.489> one<00:00:26.360> simple

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
also the steering in this case I still

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.959 
also the steering in this case I still
will<00:00:33.620> have<00:00:33.739> to<00:00:33.890> supervise<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.640> system

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
will have to supervise the system

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.459 
will have to supervise the system
because<00:00:35.210> this<00:00:35.239> is<00:00:35.480> an<00:00:35.570> early<00:00:35.660> prototype<00:00:35.989> with

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
because this is an early prototype with

because this is an early prototype with
our<00:00:36.620> intention<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.190> that<00:00:37.370> in<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.670> final

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
our intention is that in the final

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.090 
our intention is that in the final
product<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.480> driver<00:00:39.020> can<00:00:39.260> actually<00:00:39.649> release

product a driver can actually release

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.400 
product a driver can actually release
the<00:00:40.550> steering<00:00:40.940> wheel<00:00:41.120> without<00:00:41.840> having<00:00:42.289> to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
the steering wheel without having to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.860 
the steering wheel without having to
supervise<00:00:42.860> such<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:43.879> he<00:00:44.030> or<00:00:44.180> she<00:00:44.210> can<00:00:44.719> do

supervise such that he or she can do

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.840 
supervise such that he or she can do
something<00:00:45.170> else<00:00:45.320> with<00:00:45.440> their<00:00:45.590> time<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:49.640> car

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
something else with their time the car

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.729 
something else with their time the car
uses<00:00:50.270> radar<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.110> camera<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.560> ladder

has to be so robust the Travis can rely

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.510 
has to be so robust the Travis can rely
on<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.030> car<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.420> drive<00:00:59.570> in<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.809> safe<00:01:00.020> way<00:01:00.520> it
