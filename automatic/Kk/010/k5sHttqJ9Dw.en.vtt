creating<00:00:01.650> an<00:00:01.740> event<00:00:02.010> for<00:00:02.399> an<00:00:02.490> animation<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.090> a

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
creating an event for an animation is a

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.240 
creating an event for an animation is a
very<00:00:03.389> straightforward<00:00:03.629> process<00:00:04.080> we<00:00:04.950> simply

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
very straightforward process we simply

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.940 
very straightforward process we simply
need<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.460> create<00:00:06.359> an<00:00:06.540> event<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> key<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.560> we

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
need to create an event and key and we

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.129 
need to create an event and key and we
need<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.580> script<00:00:09.090> file<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.990> has<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
need to have a script file that has a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.110 
need to have a script file that has a
function<00:00:10.710> inside<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.340> would<00:00:11.460> call<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.910> on

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
function inside that would call up on

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.140 
function inside that would call up on
our<00:00:12.480> event<00:00:13.160> so<00:00:14.160> let's<00:00:14.190> go<00:00:14.400> ahead<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.580> start

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
our event so let's go ahead and start

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.240 
our event so let's go ahead and start
that<00:00:15.360> we've<00:00:16.139> got<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.410> object<00:00:16.770> right<00:00:16.949> now<00:00:17.070> with

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
that we've got an object right now with

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.980 
that we've got an object right now with
the<00:00:17.310> basic<00:00:17.640> animation<00:00:18.119> applied<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:20.689> we<00:00:21.689> do

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the basic animation applied to it we do

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.189 
the basic animation applied to it we do
not<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.199> any<00:00:22.800> event<00:00:23.070> Keys<00:00:23.689> created<00:00:24.689> yet<00:00:24.990> but

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
not have any event Keys created yet but

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
not have any event Keys created yet but
let's<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.470> ahead<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.710> create<00:00:25.800> our<00:00:26.480> script

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
let's go ahead and create our script

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.460 
let's go ahead and create our script
file<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.930> us<00:00:28.019> we're<00:00:28.109> gonna<00:00:28.230> go<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> our

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
file for us we're gonna go to our

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.740 
file for us we're gonna go to our
projects<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.220> create<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.599> gonna

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
projects to our create we're just gonna

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
projects to our create we're just gonna
create<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> Java<00:00:31.349> Script<00:00:31.790> will<00:00:32.790> change<00:00:33.030> our<00:00:33.149> new

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
create a Java Script will change our new

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:46.100 
create a Java Script will change our new
behavior<00:00:33.600> script<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:35.100> our<00:00:36.860> event<00:00:37.860> script<00:00:45.110> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
behavior script to our event script and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
behavior script to our event script and
inside<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.770> editor<00:00:47.100> window<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.579> simply

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
inside of the editor window we're simply

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.139 
inside of the editor window we're simply
going<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.770> create<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.950> function<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.120> can

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
going to create a function that we can

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.200 
going to create a function that we can
use<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.110> event<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.340> let's<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.149> one

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
use for our event so let's do this one

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.660 
use for our event so let's do this one
we're<00:00:54.510> simply<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:58.550> we'll<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
we're simply going to do we'll do a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.200 
we're simply going to do we'll do a
print<00:01:00.120> event<00:01:00.570> function<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.969> inside<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
print event function and inside of this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.820 
print event function and inside of this
we<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.510> pass<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> variable<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
we can pass a variable if we want we

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:15.130 
we can pass a variable if we want we
could<00:01:04.979> pass<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.430> let's<00:01:05.729> say

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.280 

we'll<00:01:15.680> pass<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.160> a<00:01:16.250> number<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:20.110> inside<00:01:21.110> of

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
we'll pass in a number and inside of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.840 
we'll pass in a number and inside of
this<00:01:21.440> function<00:01:24.100> we'll<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:25.280> print<00:01:25.490> out<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
this function we'll just print out to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:38.200 
this function we'll just print out to
the<00:01:25.880> console<00:01:35.440> do<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.470> Hello<00:01:36.800> event<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.580> we'll

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
the console do a Hello event and we'll

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.840 
the console do a Hello event and we'll
add<00:01:38.480> in<00:01:38.810> our<00:01:40.360> argument<00:01:41.360> from<00:01:41.870> our<00:01:42.080> function

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.640 

and<00:01:46.850> in<00:01:47.030> our<00:01:47.210> statement<00:01:47.720> we'll<00:01:48.140> save<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.500> one

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
and in our statement we'll save this one

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.860 
and in our statement we'll save this one
out

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.750 

oK<00:01:53.870> we've<00:01:54.380> created<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.920> script<00:01:55.190> now<00:01:55.430> we<00:01:55.490> want<00:01:55.670> to

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
oK we've created a script now we want to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.760 
oK we've created a script now we want to
apply<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.060> script<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.570> our<00:01:56.690> cube<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.530> let's<00:01:57.650> go

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
apply the script to our cube so let's go

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.280 
apply the script to our cube so let's go
ahead<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:57.979> put<00:01:58.159> this<00:01:58.220> component<00:01:58.760> over<00:01:58.850> here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
ahead and put this component over here

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.830 
ahead and put this component over here
we've<00:02:00.290> got<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.560> loaded<00:02:00.710> up<00:02:01.010> here<00:02:01.600> now<00:02:02.600> when<00:02:02.750> we

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
we've got it loaded up here now when we

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.140 
we've got it loaded up here now when we
go<00:02:02.960> back<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.619> our<00:02:03.650> cube<00:02:04.490> inside<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.060> our

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
go back to our cube inside of our

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.330 
go back to our cube inside of our
animation<00:02:05.630> view<00:02:05.930> we're<00:02:06.619> gonna<00:02:06.710> find<00:02:07.010> just<00:02:07.190> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
animation view we're gonna find just a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
animation view we're gonna find just a
spot<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.670> we<00:02:07.880> want<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.090> call<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.479> up<00:02:08.690> I'm

function<00:02:32.450> inside<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.140> here<00:02:33.320> our<00:02:33.800> print<00:02:34.070> event

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
function inside of here our print event

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.960 
function inside of here our print event
with<00:02:35.150> an<00:02:35.269> integer<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.739> when<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.100> select<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.940> we

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
with an integer and when we select it we

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.940 
with an integer and when we select it we
can<00:02:38.269> see<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.570> we<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.720> actually<00:02:38.989> use<00:02:39.769> this

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
can see that we can actually use this

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.130 
can see that we can actually use this
integer<00:02:40.280> value<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.000> pass<00:02:41.840> through

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
integer value and pass through

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.420 
integer value and pass through
information<00:02:42.680> if<00:02:42.950> we<00:02:43.040> need<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.220> pass

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
information if we need to pass

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.740 
information if we need to pass
information<00:02:43.670> through<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.360> could<00:02:44.570> be<00:02:44.690> an

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
information through this could be an

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.979 
information through this could be an
audio<00:02:45.380> file<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:46.330> variable<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.390> string<00:02:47.750> whatever

it might be whatever the need is for

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.900 
it might be whatever the need is for
that<00:02:50.480> function<00:02:50.959> will<00:02:51.739> pass<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.160> let's<00:02:52.489> say<00:02:52.610> 10

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.120 

I'll<00:02:55.910> close<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.590> right<00:02:57.950> now

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
I'll close that one out so right now

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.979 
I'll close that one out so right now
this<00:02:58.459> event<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.060> gonna<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.299> calling<00:02:59.570> up<00:02:59.780> that

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
this event is gonna be calling up that

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.900 
this event is gonna be calling up that
function<00:03:00.440> from<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.769> script<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.760> was

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
function from the script that was

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.250 
function from the script that was
applied<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.690> cube<00:03:02.959> object<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.140> can

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
applied to the cube object and we can

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.259 
applied to the cube object and we can
watch<00:03:06.350> our<00:03:06.530> status<00:03:06.860> line<00:03:07.040> down<00:03:07.220> here<00:03:07.250> when<00:03:08.150> we

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
watch our status line down here when we

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.259 
watch our status line down here when we
play<00:03:11.680> we're<00:03:12.680> gonna<00:03:12.769> get<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.670> point<00:03:13.970> right

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
play we're gonna get to this point right

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.930 
play we're gonna get to this point right
in<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:16.070> let's<00:03:16.250> go<00:03:16.430> ahead<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.700> pull<00:03:16.820> up

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
in here and let's go ahead and pull up

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.360 
in here and let's go ahead and pull up
our<00:03:18.250> console<00:03:19.250> window<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.709> our<00:03:24.829> console

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
our console window and in our console

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.670 
our console window and in our console
window<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:26.810> can<00:03:26.989> watch<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.620> action<00:03:27.650> happen

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
window we can watch the action happen

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.140 
window we can watch the action happen
there<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:30.769> go

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
there we go

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.940 
there we go
when<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.239> got<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.570> frame<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.440> prints<00:03:33.829> out

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
when we got to that frame it prints out

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.050 
when we got to that frame it prints out
the<00:03:33.980> hello<00:03:34.430> event<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.680> our<00:03:36.910> argument<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:37.940> we

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
the hello event and our argument that we

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.680 
the hello event and our argument that we
passed<00:03:38.269> through<00:03:38.570> with<00:03:38.720> 10

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.780 

so<00:03:43.690> there<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.020> lot<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.650> uses<00:03:45.010> for<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.340> event

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
so there are a lot of uses for the event

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.780 
so there are a lot of uses for the event
key<00:03:46.660> it's<00:03:47.290> useful<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:48.220> you're<00:03:48.340> passing<00:03:48.700> in

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
key it's useful if you're passing in

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.240 
key it's useful if you're passing in
sound<00:03:49.090> files<00:03:49.420> if<00:03:49.780> you're<00:03:49.989> passing<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.590> just

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
sound files if you're passing in just

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.050 
sound files if you're passing in just
about<00:03:51.489> any<00:03:51.880> kind<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.239> information<00:03:53.819> be<00:03:54.819> sure<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
about any kind of information be sure to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.699 
about any kind of information be sure to
take<00:03:55.300> advantage<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.230> think<00:03:56.470> once<00:03:56.650> you

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
take advantage of it I think once you

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.140 
take advantage of it I think once you
actually<00:03:57.010> set<00:03:57.220> up<00:03:57.250> your<00:03:57.489> projects<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.060> you

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
actually set up your projects and you

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.540 
actually set up your projects and you
start<00:03:58.390> working<00:03:58.720> on<00:03:58.840> them<00:03:59.100> this<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.250> something

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
start working on them this is something

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.770 
start working on them this is something
that<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:00.760> definitely<00:04:00.940> want<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.450> integrate

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
that you definitely want to integrate

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.600 
that you definitely want to integrate
into<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:03.340> pipeline<00:04:03.640> into<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.330> process
