iPhone here is finishing up first and

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.430 
iPhone here is finishing up first and
then<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> Lumia<00:02:00.869> device<00:02:01.110> I

actually<00:02:01.530> thought<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.160> Lumia<00:02:02.430> device

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
actually thought that the Lumia device

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.820 
actually thought that the Lumia device
almost<00:02:02.970> would<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.720> bit<00:02:03.840> quicker<00:02:04.020> but

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
almost would be a little bit quicker but

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.330 
almost would be a little bit quicker but
this<00:02:05.580> time<00:02:05.820> around<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.140> definitely<00:02:07.920> not

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
this time around that is definitely not

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.220 
this time around that is definitely not
the<00:02:09.330> case<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.360> thing<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.570> really<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.050> hope

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the case so one thing I really do hope

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.310 
the case so one thing I really do hope
the<00:02:13.380> Apple<00:02:13.650> fix<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.040> iOS<00:02:14.340> 8<00:02:14.630> but<00:02:15.630> they<00:02:15.840> are<00:02:16.080> not

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the Apple fix in iOS 8 but they are not

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.370 
the Apple fix in iOS 8 but they are not
going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.550> would<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:18.750> widgets<00:02:19.230> or

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380

something

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320 
something
that<00:02:20.070> would<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.370> interesting<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.239> are

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
that would be interesting but they are

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.870 
that would be interesting but they are
not<00:02:21.450> gonna<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.110> mean<00:02:22.410> they're<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:23.010> going

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
not gonna do it I mean they're not going

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880
