00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
I'm gonna do in a blackhawk because

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189 
I'm gonna do in a blackhawk because
that's<00:00:22.109> usually<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.680> most<00:00:23.330> flown<00:00:24.330> transport

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that's usually the most flown transport

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.570 
that's usually the most flown transport
helicopter<00:00:25.740> whatever<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> call<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
helicopter whatever you want to call it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.410 
helicopter whatever you want to call it
in<00:00:27.320> Arma<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:31.009> basically<00:00:32.180> instead<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> just

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
in Arma and basically instead of just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.590 
in Arma and basically instead of just
bailing<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:35.100> alone<00:00:35.600> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
bailing out like so if you're alone and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.810 
bailing out like so if you're alone and
you're<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.410> trees<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:37.950> something<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you're over trees or something like that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.369 
you're over trees or something like that
like<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.750> were<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> lose<00:00:40.050> engine

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
like right now if I were to lose engine

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
like right now if I were to lose engine
power<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.969> probably<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> good

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
power this would probably be a good

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.940 
power this would probably be a good
place<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> bail<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.360> alone<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.350> if

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
place to bail but if you're alone but if

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
place to bail but if you're alone but if
you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> back<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> don't

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you have people in the back that don't

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.770 
you have people in the back that don't
have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> parachute<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.530> something<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:51.239> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
have a parachute or something you just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.090 
have a parachute or something you just

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
ride it out to the book to the ground

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
ride it out to the book to the ground
you<00:00:53.699> might<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.090> able<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> save<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.750> might

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:44.830 
keep the nose up hold Z the whole time
to<00:01:25.010> reduce<00:01:25.670> airspeed<00:01:32.140> backwards<00:01:33.140> now<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:43.840> what

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
to reduce airspeed backwards now so what

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200 
to reduce airspeed backwards now so what
I<00:01:44.869> did<00:01:44.990> there<00:01:45.320> was<00:01:45.800> right<00:01:46.520> before<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:46.820> hit<00:01:47.149> the

ground I kept my nose up the whole time
about<00:01:50.929> 10<00:01:51.229> degrees<00:01:51.320> up<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:54.399> before<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:56.240> hit<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
about 10 degrees up and before I hit the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.169 
about 10 degrees up and before I hit the
ground<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.770> pulled<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.100> nose<00:01:58.280> up<00:01:58.460> way<00:01:58.880> high<00:01:58.910> so

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
ground I pulled the nose up way high so

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the tail would hit first well they're

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.529 
the tail would hit first well they're
going<00:02:01.460> forward<00:02:01.820> or<00:02:01.910> backward<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.300> doesn't

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
going forward or backward it doesn't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.969 
going forward or backward it doesn't
matter<00:02:02.720> cuz<00:02:02.960> obviously<00:02:03.110> right<00:02:03.500> there<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.710> was

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
matter cuz obviously right there I was

tail<00:02:06.979> hit<00:02:07.190> first<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:08.590> then<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.009> rest<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
tail hit first and then the rest of the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.360 
tail hit first and then the rest of the
helicopter<00:02:10.789> came<00:02:10.970> down<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.530> lot<00:02:13.130> less

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
helicopter came down and I a lot less

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.770 
helicopter came down and I a lot less
damage<00:02:13.610> than<00:02:13.790> if<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.060> were<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.420> straight<00:02:14.750> down

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
damage than if I were just straight down

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.630 
damage than if I were just straight down
landed<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:17.140> lot<00:02:18.140> better<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.620> do<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.250> your

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
landed a lot better to do this your

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640 
landed a lot better to do this your
helicopter<00:02:20.090> will<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.510> will<00:02:20.660> take<00:02:20.870> damage<00:02:21.260> but

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
helicopter will it will take damage but

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.620 
helicopter will it will take damage but
it<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> lot<00:02:22.489> better<00:02:22.670> than<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.000> entire<00:02:23.120> crew

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630
