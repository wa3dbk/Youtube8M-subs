00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.260
 ships to say 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
 ladies and gentlemen nonsense simply count the home computer 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:11.489
 came to the conclusion last month 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:18.220
 that the Netherlands is becoming the most populous country in Europe is the computer 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.900
 gives a few hard digits 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.279
 what are they to be afraid of k 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.149
 Dutch banks went 61 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.719
 not too scared seventy percent of the population 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.750
 the 25 percent 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.740
 do not know 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.950
 5 percent 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.940
 polar lights in those figures in 19 81 twenty years later 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.130
 not afraid 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.830
 one percent 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.350
 scared 82 percent of the Dutch 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 I do not know 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.450
 seventeen percent 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.330
 but wait a moment, seventeen percent 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.110
 do not know if that actually so I am afraid 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.700
 so I disagree so 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.219
 we tell the rescue work 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.300
 39 percent are scared 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.520
 those numbers are still flattering and parked and percent to amp 39 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.820
 cent 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.620
 anp to be true all those dutch people 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.630
 afraid of where they are often 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.830
 a few the park 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.340
 they are afraid of it 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 nuclear weapons for diseases 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.640
 before death 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 for the future the future after death 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.400
 for spiders 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.100
 for chipboard 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 for the dentist 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.850
 and for gypsies k 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 music etc 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 some fears are debut 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.910
 other side of the last few years 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.230
 we are here in the netherlands for the gypsies 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.640
 for 650 years now 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.870
 scared but that does not need to be scared of gypsies scraping 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.900
 because gypsies are safe in the prison of persons 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.659
 yet it has been decades 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.270
 and that is because mrs hs is not just scared of gypsies 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.870
 but again I choose scared and legally scared 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.479
 hence she says 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.360
 that being can never say the only thing I can not do is say come then 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.199
 fair is fair 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.709
 That's true they said held in interviews 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 Wednesday 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.409
 it was a strange region 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.490
 I can not say come but delicious in the Netherlands 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.469
 come to see me here is now a private see 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.679
 However, that writes coffee time from 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.089
 do you think a cup of tea with a kitchen marie 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:32.729
 whether you not only just once again in the Netherlands kv kortrijk it 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.729
 all I can do now is say come but be honest be honest 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:41.019
 come here with a day to say very high like that of it 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.570
 Paradise inhabitant has almost all here so wonderful in the Netherlands 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.720
 you are not allowed to, yes, you are not allowed to die alone 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.480
 became a hero and he brought a child in limete and is no longer a party 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.589
 then year 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:58.540
 the equestrian gypsies in prison some find this country 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.779
 the free boys 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.240
 and who have the freedom of our religion 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.080
 that seems to be doing less well to find out which flu the site reports 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.130
 can get a location so everything is not solved yet 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.069
 it is being worked on 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.039
 but that the minister 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.859
 dare to claim 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.379
 that it is here 19 81 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.659
 would be wonderful in the Netherlands 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.519
 before the cigarette 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.879
 that is to be scared of 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.610
 yes and talking about banks the other nondeju people our age will 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.010
 you can still fully remember this year you will certainly have that villa in October 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.430
 19 61 in the letterbox 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.560
 that was just really nice in the front door how you can bring a mistake 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.540
 making sparv a difficult job utrecht but then the government wanted us 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.309
 to protect 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.769
 these are thinking 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.619
 yes to their talk to name of fantasia when the man was still there some fun 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.269
 now the minister wiegel no longer wants to protect us 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.689
 only who do you think you should not play a role 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.160
 because he is afraid that people have become scared or that it is lower 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.780
 so be responded there have not been a week come by during one 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.129
 rush in rotterdam 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.329
 the joke maker we are not talking about 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.849
 because the best joke is alpine made in 61. I also got it by Harry 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.859
 peasants worth gold that issued this pamphlet 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.949
 thinking for the youngest day yes but still it is a whole problem 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.840
 with nuclear energy 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.190
 we now also have it and armament is coming 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.020
 the core 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.979
 armament that is of course also harry mulisch the foundation that pamphlet it 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.539
 Next for all it must be the regulated preparation of the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.740
 of which the protection and part are 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.860
 give way 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.360
 for a collective anxiety attack a strike by the total world population 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.290
 a massive demonstration and start walking after an hour 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.290
 considered the only preservation of the human gender 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.749
 that was just the one 60 when digital mail was not received but 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.170
 maybe I am here now from that enlightening chaos 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.530
 in February 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.569
 at the Labor Party Congress 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.360
 just before that out for so offers 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.330
 well as there as an enrichment of our time in cafe position 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.240
 be taken over 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.639
 then it turns out the woman saw Rhodes through the neighborhoods wits I choose cafe 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.600
 standpoint by hits of unilateral disarmament 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.529
 nuclear weapons now I am fine with that 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.449
 yes that's fine but just but 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.550
 if that happens 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.320
 then stops running at the end 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.400
 the turn 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.600
 yes and that is why those positions must now be aligned 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.779
 we all want to get away from within the labor party 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:40.990
 the first group 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.219
 that deal that have nuclear weapons first 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.429
 to be able to do omaha anp is actually the first thing to love 

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:49.249
 can separate 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.249
 Donner there is a group that wants those nuclear weapons 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.199
 also with reservation 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.350
 this is actually 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.819
 only on the relationship with cruise missiles 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.180
 that is a lot to say 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.270
 now they want to have it 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.529
 but we want to get rid of it in four years 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.729
 so that is actually a run to nothing to the engagement and then there is 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.319
 another group that says we want them to have imtech within limits 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.319
 maximum 8 years from the stake 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.279
 3 of the core tasks 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.919
 next to the consultants are 8 years with something then it is saying and that is 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.629
 for bees and then you don't want anything anymore so if you want to get rid of it then you have to 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.719
 that it is now from I must equally offers I have such a suspicion about it 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:32.719
 be right back 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.610
 a shame this way 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.069
 disgust whoever is interested in 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.199
 politics 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.059
 well then i got it 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.059
 our core task but all alone 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.999
 Labour Party 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:51.550
 now finally leave a us 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.460
 liberating 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.069
 hear sound 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.069
 break bauer has passed through that fear 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.740
 in July 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.520
 can those gypsies 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.229
 of world politics 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.529
 away with the nuclear weapons
