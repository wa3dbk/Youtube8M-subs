now I just need to check something

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.070 
now I just need to check something
though<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:17.810> yep<00:00:18.810> perfect<00:00:20.210> good<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.539> good

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

for<00:00:22.109> us<00:00:22.439> now<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:27.150> way<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> connect<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
for us now the way you connect all the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.140 
for us now the way you connect all the
circuits<00:00:28.410> will<00:00:28.590> different<00:00:29.039> well<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> mean<00:00:29.939> will

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
circuits will different well I mean will

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.229 
circuits will different well I mean will
vary<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.980> have

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
vary because of the way that you have

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.229 
vary because of the way that you have
your<00:00:33.239> terrain<00:00:34.219> like<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.520> i<00:00:35.550> had<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> change

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
your terrain like that i had a change

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.920 
your terrain like that i had a change
because<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> hill<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.469> couldn't<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.160> this

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
because of the hill I couldn't do this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.610 
because of the hill I couldn't do this
but<00:00:40.640> it's<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.180> worth<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.660> well

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
but it's all going to be worth it well

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:57.610 
but it's all going to be worth it well
we<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.789> daresay<00:00:45.390> close<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.559> done<00:00:50.600> ok

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.529

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
now I need to run this thing through a

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:10.420 
now I need to run this thing through a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.590 
congratulations you're going to get a
little<00:04:50.850> explanation<00:04:51.270> weiming<00:04:52.140> this<00:04:53.540> okay<00:04:54.540> so

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600

little explanation weiming this okay so
basically<00:04:56.930> i'm<00:04:57.930> trying<00:04:58.380> i'm<00:04:58.530> making<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.070> area

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
basically i'm trying i'm making the area

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.580 
basically i'm trying i'm making the area
for<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.580> lava<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.970> go<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.390> mean<00:05:01.050> you'll<00:05:01.200> see<00:05:01.380> me

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
for the lava to go I mean you'll see me

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.670 
for the lava to go I mean you'll see me
put<00:05:01.980> it<00:05:02.130> but<00:05:02.360> you'll<00:05:03.360> just<00:05:03.540> think<00:05:03.750> some<00:05:04.320> people

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
put it but you'll just think some people

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.800 
put it but you'll just think some people
who<00:05:04.920> skip<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.370> may<00:05:05.730> think<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.450> just<00:05:06.660> put<00:05:06.780> a

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
who skip this may think I just put a

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.480 
who skip this may think I just put a
solid<00:05:07.140> wall<00:05:07.320> but<00:05:07.620> no<00:05:07.800> this<00:05:08.100> is<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> very

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
solid wall but no this is a very

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.060 
solid wall but no this is a very
important<00:05:08.940> step<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.330> process<00:05:10.040> you<00:05:11.040> have

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
important step to the process you have

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.400 
important step to the process you have
to<00:05:11.280> make<00:05:11.430> an<00:05:11.580> area<00:05:11.880> for<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.180> lava<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.020> go<00:05:13.370> so

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
to make an area for the lava to go so

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.560 
to make an area for the lava to go so
this<00:05:16.410> is<00:05:16.440> what<00:05:16.919> that<00:05:17.340> is<00:05:17.520> for<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.090> now<00:05:18.450> i'm

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
this is what that is for and now i'm

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.030 
this is what that is for and now i'm
going<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.750> go<00:05:18.870> back<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.110> fast<00:05:19.530> forwarding

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
going to go back to fast forwarding

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.380 
going to go back to fast forwarding
y'all<00:05:21.230> I<00:05:22.230> don't<00:05:22.950> know<00:05:23.070> step<00:05:23.760> away<00:05:23.880> for<00:05:24.210> a

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
y'all I don't know step away for a

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.990 
y'all I don't know step away for a
