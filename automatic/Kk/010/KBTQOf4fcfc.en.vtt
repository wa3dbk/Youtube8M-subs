00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
bottom is our two feet that looks very

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.850 
bottom is our two feet that looks very
dope<00:02:13.670> more<00:02:13.909> silver<00:02:14.299> paint<00:02:14.540> applications<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
dope more silver paint applications the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.559 
dope more silver paint applications the
blue<00:02:16.069> actually<00:02:16.489> seems<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.849> have<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.299> kind

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
blue actually seems to have like a kind

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.300 
blue actually seems to have like a kind
of<00:02:17.659> a<00:02:17.780> glassy<00:02:18.349> look<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:18.890> when<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.040> open

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
of a glassy look to it and when you open

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.770 
of a glassy look to it and when you open
the<00:02:19.400> figure<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.760> these<00:02:20.000> two<00:02:20.239> pieces<00:02:20.450> right

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the figure up these two pieces right

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.059 
the figure up these two pieces right
here<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.140> are<00:02:21.200> attached<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> sides

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
here that are attached to the sides

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.979 
here that are attached to the sides
these<00:02:22.370> are<00:02:22.430> counted<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.180> accessories<00:02:23.840> which

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
these are counted as accessories which

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.270 
these are counted as accessories which
is<00:02:24.140> kind<00:02:24.439> of<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.620> bummer<00:02:24.830> because<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.189> just

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
is kind of a bummer because it's just

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.070 
is kind of a bummer because it's just
part<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.610> his<00:02:25.730> regular<00:02:25.939> Lake<00:02:26.390> really<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.989> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
part of his regular Lake really in the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.750 
part of his regular Lake really in the
back<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.379> our<00:02:27.470> two's<00:02:27.709> feet<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.310> there's<00:02:28.580> our

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
back of our two's feet and there's our

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.550 
back of our two's feet and there's our
two's<00:02:29.000> butt<00:02:29.420> hole<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> then<00:02:29.930> some<00:02:30.200> more<00:02:30.230> solar

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
two's butt hole and then some more solar

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.899 
two's butt hole and then some more solar
paint<00:02:30.799> applications<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.340> lot<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.580> nothing

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
paint applications a lot of nothing

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.000 
paint applications a lot of nothing
right<00:02:31.939> there<00:02:32.090> yeah<00:02:32.720> as<00:02:32.900> expected<00:02:33.409> r2<00:02:33.950> is

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
right there yeah as expected r2 is

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.370 
right there yeah as expected r2 is
articulation<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.790> pretty<00:02:35.090> damn<00:02:35.390> limited<00:02:35.750> his

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
articulation is pretty damn limited his

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.400 
articulation is pretty damn limited his
head<00:02:36.709> rotates<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.000> right<00:02:38.540> towards

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
head rotates to the right towards

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.450 
head rotates to the right towards
his<00:02:39.560> right<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.070> I'm<00:02:40.130> gonna<00:02:40.280> call<00:02:40.430> that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
his right so I'm gonna call that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.790 
his right so I'm gonna call that
clockwise<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.140> could<00:02:42.260> also<00:02:42.410> move<00:02:42.680> it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
clockwise and you could also move it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.440 
clockwise and you could also move it
counterclockwise<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:44.210> you<00:02:44.300> keep

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
counterclockwise but if you keep

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.480 
counterclockwise but if you keep
rotating<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:45.170> counterclockwise<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
rotating it counterclockwise what it

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.120 
rotating it counterclockwise what it
does<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.030> releases<00:02:47.360> his<00:02:47.750> foot<00:02:48.380> which<00:02:49.100> is

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
does is it releases his foot which is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.980 
does is it releases his foot which is
pretty<00:02:49.460> cool<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.570> we<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.690> that

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
pretty cool so I like that we have that

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.180 
pretty cool so I like that we have that
function<00:02:51.290> right<00:02:51.590> there<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:51.980> want<00:02:52.130> to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
function right there if you want to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.980 
function right there if you want to
leave<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.670> up<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.910> little<00:02:53.210> bit<00:02:53.360> more<00:02:53.570> you<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:53.720> do

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
leave it up a little bit more you can do

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.690 
leave it up a little bit more you can do
that<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.740> rotate<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.160> all<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.340> way<00:02:55.460> to<00:02:55.490> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that we rotate it all the way to the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.800 
that we rotate it all the way to the
left<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.030> there<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.330> go

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
left and there you go

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.480 
left and there you go
he<00:02:57.110> has<00:02:57.230> really<00:02:57.530> nice<00:02:57.680> wheels<00:02:58.100> underneath

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
he has really nice wheels underneath

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.160 
he has really nice wheels underneath
here<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.880> course<00:02:59.060> these<00:02:59.300> legs<00:02:59.600> right<00:02:59.810> here<00:03:00.020> can

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
here of course these legs right here can

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.710 
here of course these legs right here can
move<00:03:00.320> forward<00:03:00.740> back<00:03:01.130> actually<00:03:01.430> 360<00:03:02.210> over<00:03:02.450> here

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
move forward back actually 360 over here

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.680 
move forward back actually 360 over here
and<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.290> feet<00:03:03.530> move<00:03:03.920> down<00:03:04.280> up<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:05.120> much

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
and then the feet move down up that much

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.930 
and then the feet move down up that much
jazz<00:03:05.990> hands<00:03:06.290> r2d2<00:03:06.800> are<00:03:07.160> two<00:03:07.340> rolls<00:03:07.580> quite

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
jazz hands r2d2 are two rolls quite

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.000 
jazz hands r2d2 are two rolls quite
nicely<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.360> that's<00:03:08.930> kind<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.200> fun<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:09.830> kind

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
nicely so that's kind of fun it's kind

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.050 
nicely so that's kind of fun it's kind
of<00:03:10.040> neat<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.430> foot<00:03:10.610> right<00:03:10.730> here<00:03:10.940> is

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
of neat the foot right here is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.490 
of neat the foot right here is
articulated<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.840> can<00:03:11.930> move<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.110> forwards

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
articulated so you can move it forwards

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.930 
articulated so you can move it forwards
and<00:03:12.710> backwards<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.250> little<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.490> now<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.820> this

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
and backwards a little bit now and this

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.580 
and backwards a little bit now and this
is<00:03:14.060> all<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.300> way<00:03:14.390> out<00:03:14.420> over<00:03:14.780> here<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.410> can

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
is all the way out over here you can

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.470 
is all the way out over here you can
move<00:03:15.740> it<00:03:15.890> left<00:03:16.130> but<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.910> foot<00:03:17.150> right<00:03:17.300> here

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
move it left but the foot right here

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.290 
move it left but the foot right here
will<00:03:17.660> still<00:03:18.140> touch<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.980> ground<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.790> even

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
will still touch the ground so even

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.120 
will still touch the ground so even
though<00:03:20.390> he's<00:03:20.570> moving<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.320> way<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.710> doesn't

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
though he's moving this way it doesn't

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.760 
though he's moving this way it doesn't
really<00:03:22.310> totally<00:03:22.670> ruin<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:23.540> look<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.530> him

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
really totally ruin that look for him

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.470 
really totally ruin that look for him
turning<00:03:25.070> left<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.580> could<00:03:25.730> still<00:03:26.030> make<00:03:26.300> that

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
turning left you could still make that

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.000 
turning left you could still make that
sound<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.050> go<00:03:27.170> click<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.680> can<00:03:27.830> get<00:03:27.920> him

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
sound and go click so you can get him

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.350 
sound and go click so you can get him
looking<00:03:28.250> all<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.610> way<00:03:28.700> around<00:03:29.000> even<00:03:29.270> though

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
looking all the way around even though

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.540 
looking all the way around even though
it's<00:03:29.510> kind<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.780> scary<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:30.440> it'll<00:03:31.010> be<00:03:31.100> fine<00:03:31.340> and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
it's kind of scary but it'll be fine and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.430 
it's kind of scary but it'll be fine and
the<00:03:31.760> function<00:03:32.120> still<00:03:32.360> works<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.020> that's<00:03:33.230> cool

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
the function still works so that's cool

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.140 
the function still works so that's cool
as<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.950> mentioned<00:03:34.250> before<00:03:34.310> these<00:03:34.640> parts<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.060> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
as I mentioned before these parts to the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.940 
as I mentioned before these parts to the

you<00:03:37.040> can<00:03:37.130> see<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.430> slot<00:03:37.670> for<00:03:37.880> this<00:03:38.060> piece<00:03:38.330> is<00:03:38.570> a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
you can see the slot for this piece is a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.910 
you can see the slot for this piece is a
little<00:03:38.930> bit<00:03:39.050> bigger<00:03:39.230> than<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.440> one<00:03:39.740> over

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.910 
in and it goes in quite nicely which is
pretty<00:03:44.480> cool<00:03:44.720> but<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.290> could<00:03:45.410> actually<00:03:45.530> take

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
pretty cool but you could actually take

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.380
