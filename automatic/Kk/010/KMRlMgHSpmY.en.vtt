you<00:03:21.630> fly<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.080> normal<00:03:22.380> mode<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:24.630> were<00:03:24.780> you

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
you fly in the normal mode that were you

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470 
you fly in the normal mode that were you
doing<00:03:25.670> that's<00:03:26.670> why<00:03:26.790> we're<00:03:26.910> fine<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.270> grass

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.030 
doing that's why we're fine on the grass
so<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.930> doesn't<00:03:28.200> break<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.650> land<00:03:28.830> it's

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
so it doesn't break if you land it's

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.170 
so it doesn't break if you land it's
just<00:03:29.570> take<00:03:30.570> off<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> gas<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:32.670> no<00:03:32.820> guessing
