00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 you 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.949
 the first time I sing in public 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.960
 was the graduation of the institute and I thought 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.910
 that he was going to have an unbearable fear and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.489
 I was really surprised that it was not like that 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.840
 I think it was like the road to 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 lessons the music and you can do something 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 with them 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.630
 Y 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.350
 I think I've been so scattered that 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.670
 I have been removing everything that was on top 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.740
 of music and what has been left 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.910
 in the end I do not have a process for all 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.040
 the songs but it is true that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.540
 I take great care of the lyrics although I really 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.090
 for me the most important thing is music 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.090
 what is playing inside is music 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.590
 I looked more like operating brains or 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 dissecting frogs or doing things like that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.030
 a little more disgusting but in the end 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.960
 what has stolen me the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.960
 time so 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 the campaign ended successfully that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.369
 we meet the objective in time and nothing 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.990
 We have now finished recording and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.990
 I think it will come out next month 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.630
 I think he has his own concept like that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.850
 that follows the same line in terms of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 melodies are perceived to me at all times 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.110
 but it has its own concept of why 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.189
 it has been a comb a disc is its own 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.909
 of your own history 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.909
 life 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.270
 true 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 and I believe that each person is born with a 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.579
 special talent and will not find 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.400
 nothing that I can do as well as I 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.750
 what's inside of me then I think that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.650
 just find the talent and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.650
 bet on him 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.420
 of 2015 let's be first we start 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.870
 like in festivals in summer we have 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.040
 sonorama and the festival of the senses and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.330
 we will be closing some other date and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.860
 We will also start with the tour of 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.860
 presenting for two tomorrow
