is beneficial in many ways number one it

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.840 
is beneficial in many ways number one it
allows<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.619> frequencies<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.460> tweeter<00:01:27.700> to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
allows the frequencies of the tweeter to

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.670 
allows the frequencies of the tweeter to
play<00:01:28.060> lower<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:29.110> gives<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> better

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
play lower that gives you a better

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.320 
play lower that gives you a better
blending<00:01:30.220> between<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.670> low<00:01:30.820> frequency

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
blending between the low frequency

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.300 
blending between the low frequency
driver<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.020> tweeter<00:01:32.290> gives<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.070> better

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
driver and the tweeter gives you better

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.490 
driver and the tweeter gives you better
smoother<00:01:33.850> mid-range<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.660> overall<00:01:35.350> better

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
smoother mid-range and overall better

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.779 
smoother mid-range and overall better
output<00:01:36.070> number<00:01:36.670> two<00:01:37.000> because<00:01:37.300> it's<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.570> larger

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
output number two because it's a larger

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.550 
output number two because it's a larger
diaphragm<00:01:39.789> itself<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.720> voice<00:01:41.140> coil<00:01:41.440> is

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
diaphragm itself the voice coil is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.859 
diaphragm itself the voice coil is
larger<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.670> allows<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.300> have<00:01:43.630> better

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
larger that allows you to have better

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.120 
larger that allows you to have better
power<00:01:44.110> handling<00:01:44.560> better<00:01:44.890> heat<00:01:45.100> dissipation

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
power handling better heat dissipation

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.240 
power handling better heat dissipation
so<00:01:45.909> again<00:01:46.149> you<00:01:46.270> get<00:01:46.509> better<00:01:47.380> sound<00:01:47.619> quality

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
so again you get better sound quality

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.350 
so again you get better sound quality
and<00:01:48.580> reliability<00:01:49.570> with<00:01:49.869> computers<00:01:50.320> as<00:01:50.470> well

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and reliability with computers as well

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.490 
and reliability with computers as well

and a quarter inch and up have a unit of
a<00:02:03.220> tweeter

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
a tweeter

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.999 
a tweeter
it's<00:02:04.090> actually<00:02:04.599> mounted<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.259> angle<00:02:05.709> and

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
it's actually mounted in the angle and

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.080 
it's actually mounted in the angle and
you<00:02:06.849> can<00:02:06.880> rotate<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.750> tweeter<00:02:08.080> up<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:09.090> 350

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
you can rotate the tweeter up to 350

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.960 
you can rotate the tweeter up to 350
degrees<00:02:10.420> or<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.069> angle<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.160> for<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.640> best

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
degrees or so and angle it for the best

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.640 
degrees or so and angle it for the best
possible<00:02:13.209> imaging<00:02:13.930> no<00:02:14.080> matter<00:02:14.260> where<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
possible imaging no matter where the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.770 
possible imaging no matter where the
speaker's<00:02:15.010> mounted<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> car<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
speaker's mounted in the car so it's a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780 
speaker's mounted in the car so it's a
great<00:02:17.080> sound<00:02:17.440> even<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.190> speaker's<00:02:18.580> mouth

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
great sound even if the speaker's mouth

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.050 
great sound even if the speaker's mouth
is<00:02:18.970> way<00:02:19.120> down<00:02:19.330> low<00:02:19.540> with<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.810> door
