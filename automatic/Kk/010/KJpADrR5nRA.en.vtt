00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
cool grey Copic markers I started with

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.940 
cool grey Copic markers I started with
the<00:01:27.420> light<00:01:27.600> shades<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.290> figure<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.710> where<00:01:28.890> the

confident<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.590> started<00:01:31.920> adding<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
confident with that I started adding the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
confident with that I started adding the
darker<00:01:32.610> shades<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.270> add<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.810> extra<00:01:33.990> depth<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
darker shades to add some extra depth to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
darker shades to add some extra depth to
the<00:01:34.650> drawing<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.579> once<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> gray<00:01:36.060> areas

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the drawing and then once the gray areas

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
the drawing and then once the gray areas
were<00:01:36.540> complete<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.020> started<00:01:37.439> adding<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> red

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
were complete I started adding the red

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.870 
were complete I started adding the red
areas<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.670> cadmium<00:01:39.630> red<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.049> cardinal<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
areas with cadmium red a cardinal and a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.020 
areas with cadmium red a cardinal and a
powder<00:01:42.630> pink<00:01:42.990> Copic<00:01:43.439> marker<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.369> red<00:01:44.549> areas

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
powder pink Copic marker the red areas

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
powder pink Copic marker the red areas
of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> colossal<00:01:45.630> Titan<00:01:46.049> are<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:47.189> much

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of the colossal Titan are pretty much

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.020 
of the colossal Titan are pretty much
exposed<00:01:48.090> muscle<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.740> kind<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.130> followed<00:01:50.490> my

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
exposed muscle so I kind of followed my

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.370 
exposed muscle so I kind of followed my
hair<00:01:51.750> tutorial<00:01:52.880> methods<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.810> effects<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
hair tutorial methods in effects that I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
hair tutorial methods in effects that I
had<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.680> leave<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> highlights<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.670> make<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
had to leave the highlights to make it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.260 
had to leave the highlights to make it
seem<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.920> light<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.430> reflecting<00:02:00.060> off

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
seem like the light was reflecting off

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410 
seem like the light was reflecting off
the<00:02:00.750> muscle<00:02:01.680> tissue<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.189> basically<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.149> built

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the muscle tissue I basically just built

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
the muscle tissue I basically just built
up<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> layers<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.200> left<00:02:04.710> some<00:02:04.829> highlights

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
up the layers and left some highlights

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
up the layers and left some highlights
to<00:02:05.369> make<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.759> seem<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.299> muscle<00:02:06.630> tissue

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
to make it seem like the muscle tissue

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.180 
to make it seem like the muscle tissue
was<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.409> sticking<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> face

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
was actually sticking out from the face

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.940 
was actually sticking out from the face
and<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.239> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> gross<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.349> that's<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and it's kind of gross but that's the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
and it's kind of gross but that's the
way<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.370> colossal<00:02:11.940> Titan<00:02:12.270> is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
way the colossal Titan is

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.130 
way the colossal Titan is
he<00:02:13.230> has<00:02:13.350> lots<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.620> exposed<00:02:14.040> tissue<00:02:15.140> surrounded

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
he has lots of exposed tissue surrounded

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.410 
he has lots of exposed tissue surrounded
by<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> bone<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.950> leaving<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> highlights

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
by the bone and leaving the highlights

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.090 
by the bone and leaving the highlights
made<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.990> muscle<00:02:19.290> tissue<00:02:19.470> seem<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.010> was

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
made the muscle tissue seem like it was

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.280 
made the muscle tissue seem like it was
actually<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.910> protruding<00:02:21.480> from<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.870> face<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
actually like protruding from the face I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.930 
actually like protruding from the face I
think<00:02:22.500> that's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.710> really<00:02:22.920> cool<00:02:23.040> effects<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
think that's a really cool effects and I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.840 
think that's a really cool effects and I
was<00:02:24.030> really<00:02:24.150> pleased<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.640> made<00:02:26.640> sure

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
was really pleased with that I made sure

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.250 
was really pleased with that I made sure
to<00:02:26.880> leave<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> highlights<00:02:27.570> for<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.930> reason

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
to leave the highlights for that reason

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.040 
to leave the highlights for that reason
and<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.310> works<00:02:29.490> very<00:02:29.760> well<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.180> then

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
and I think it works very well and then

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.280 
and I think it works very well and then
for<00:02:31.260> his<00:02:31.440> eyes<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.010> added<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.150> bit<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.750> cadmium

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
for his eyes I added a bit of cadmium

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.920 
for his eyes I added a bit of cadmium
red<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.610> used<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.970> powder<00:02:36.150> pink<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
red and I used the powder pink for the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.330 
red and I used the powder pink for the
whites<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.740> his<00:02:37.860> eyes<00:02:39.020> along<00:02:40.020> with<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.560> uniball

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
whites of his eyes along with a uniball

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.240 
whites of his eyes along with a uniball
signo<00:02:41.400> broad<00:02:41.730> pigment<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.360> white<00:02:42.630> pen<00:02:42.870> -<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
signo broad pigment a white pen - as the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.580 
signo broad pigment a white pen - as the
opaque<00:02:44.760> white<00:02:45.120> highlight<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.960> his<00:02:46.200> eye<00:02:46.320> I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
opaque white highlight in his eye I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.560 
opaque white highlight in his eye I
think<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:47.070> helps<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.550> make<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> eyes<00:02:48.210> seem

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
think that helps to make the eyes seem

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.030 
think that helps to make the eyes seem
more<00:02:48.780> realistic<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.500> helps<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.770> make<00:02:49.950> them

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
more realistic and it helps to make them

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.240 
more realistic and it helps to make them
stand<00:02:50.280> out<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.960> in<00:02:51.960> this<00:02:52.320> case<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.800> made<00:02:53.070> sure

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
stand out and in this case I made sure

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.740 
stand out and in this case I made sure
the<00:02:53.520> Titan<00:02:53.880> was<00:02:54.000> actually<00:02:54.240> looking<00:02:54.540> directly

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the Titan was actually looking directly

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.600 
the Titan was actually looking directly
at<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.170> viewer<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.710> with<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> blue<00:02:56.490> sky

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
at the viewer and with the blue sky

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.700 
at the viewer and with the blue sky
background<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.450> added<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:58.080> makes<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.560> seem

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
background that I added it makes it seem

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.260 
background that I added it makes it seem
like<00:02:58.770> you're<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> cadets<00:02:59.880> kind<00:03:00.210> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
like you're one of the cadets kind of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.240 
like you're one of the cadets kind of
flying<00:03:00.510> past<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.050> colossal<00:03:01.500> Titan<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:02.100> it's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
flying past the colossal Titan as it's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.980 
flying past the colossal Titan as it's
looking<00:03:02.520> at<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.630> think<00:03:03.840> that's

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
looking at you and I think that's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.930 
looking at you and I think that's
awesome<00:03:04.170> once<00:03:04.950> I've<00:03:05.130> completed<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.610> coloring

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
awesome once I've completed the coloring

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.550 
awesome once I've completed the coloring
with<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> Copic<00:03:06.360> markers<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> decided<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.470> add

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
with the Copic markers I decided to add

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.670 
with the Copic markers I decided to add
some<00:03:07.590> extra<00:03:07.890> details<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.580> shading<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
some extra details and shading with the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.170 
some extra details and shading with the
black<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.950> white<00:03:11.160> prismacolor<00:03:11.670> pencils

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
black and white prismacolor pencils

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.880 
black and white prismacolor pencils
these<00:03:12.660> work<00:03:12.840> really<00:03:12.870> well<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.710> think

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
these work really well and I think

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.320 
these work really well and I think
they're<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> really<00:03:14.130> nice<00:03:14.400> way<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> add<00:03:15.060> some

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
they're a really nice way to add some

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.970 
they're a really nice way to add some
extra<00:03:15.510> details<00:03:15.900> over<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.320> top<00:03:16.500> especially

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
extra details over the top especially

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.250 
extra details over the top especially
the<00:03:17.400> black<00:03:17.550> pencil<00:03:17.880> seems<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.810> add<00:03:18.930> some<00:03:19.080> extra

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260

make the face stand out a lot more so
I'd<00:03:36.209> highly<00:03:36.390> recommend<00:03:36.540> using<00:03:37.170> prismacolor

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
I'd highly recommend using prismacolor

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.160

I'm<00:03:40.470> really<00:03:40.530> pleased<00:03:41.160> with<00:03:41.340> how<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.610> drawing

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I'm really pleased with how this drawing

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.330 
I'm really pleased with how this drawing
turned<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.930> wasn't<00:03:43.709> really<00:03:43.830> sure<00:03:44.040> how<00:03:44.070> I

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
turned out I wasn't really sure how I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.680 
turned out I wasn't really sure how I
was<00:03:44.610> going<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.790> create<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.209> muscle<00:03:45.480> tissue

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
was going to create the muscle tissue

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.090 
was going to create the muscle tissue
but<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.200> end<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.500> seems<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.860> work<00:03:47.070> quite

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
but in the end it seems to work quite

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.150 
but in the end it seems to work quite
well<00:03:47.580> all<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> added<00:03:48.390> highlights<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.990> it<00:03:49.980> was

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
well all the added highlights and it was

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.380 
well all the added highlights and it was
definitely<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.520> different<00:03:50.820> kind<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.030> drawing

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
definitely a different kind of drawing

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.910 
definitely a different kind of drawing
so<00:03:52.140> hopefully<00:03:52.410> I'll<00:03:52.470> work<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.740> some<00:03:52.890> more
