00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.499
 Salmond company presents 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.980
 one size lure called jack 18 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.949
 centimeters 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.060
 in two versions on a donkey 70 grams and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 floating 60 grams earlier 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.800
 m both versions presented in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800
 natural colors and so 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 called colors from 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.600
 for using this bait 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.970
 relating to the typical jerba this 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 especially important application 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.800
 appropriate gear fished jack 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 very active heavy bait does not render 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.219
 like no resistance 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.699
 the key to success is perfect 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.890
 control of her work in cyprus 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.479
 catching other bait soms weight 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.670
 which exceeds 50 grams so in the case of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.560
 bait jack we recommend 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 apply casting post 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.790
 but its members are still poster 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.220
 rods length of one meter 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.550
 eighty five centimeters to two 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.760
 meters from forty centimeters 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.290
 the multiplier with the cord is immediately equal 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.230
 load of at least twenty kilograms 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.410
 and sturdy about supplied reliable 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.270
 clasps uahr fishing technique on floating 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.150
 torso version is different 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 let's start with the floating version 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.630
 after casting we slow down the bait 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.770
 a few smooth rush of them 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.580
 the amount depends on the depth and reservoirs 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.120
 maximum immersion depth of about 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.900
 reaches one meter after 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 two three movements 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.620
 max on the floor meter depth will be quite 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.600
 one batch is enough after 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.980
 which you can even allow bait 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.819
 ascend 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.019
 the length of the runway tie also depends 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.839
 deep place Volga 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.559
 maximum depth 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.819
 work is achieved and things from the resort 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.819
 things to the surface of the water 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.949
 rub 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.869
 sometimes to bring out bait discharge 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.349
 mice or hold and in international 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.699
 vegetation we will be forced 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.309
 raise rod top video bait quota 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.309
 the surface itself 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.739
 as the depth increases, dropping 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.299
 decisions will be decided as a direction 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.549
 after each of france budget 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.239
 scolari he wiggles the head 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.349
 bait released 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.049
 bc if the depth together in catching 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.529
 exceeds two meters need to apply 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.680
 using the version of the work of a drowning person 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.060
 slightly different from work 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.619
 cloak 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.049
 somewhat more willing to slide forward 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.149
 however, they are cautious 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.039
 wiggling during a pause is very difficult 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:28.339
 hartron bait rather slowly 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.749
 rolling over from side to side it is created for 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.409
 major empathetic acts on them like 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.409
 the notorious red cloak on the sides 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.839
 when catching the motor more powerful version that is 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.619
 and the rod should not be too 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.619
 energetic tags smoother 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.839
 author if we catch near the shore i 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.069
 I think dramatically goes to 3 4 meters under the scarf 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.959
 need to use sinking qualities 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.379
 bait after casting waiting when 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.049
 it will reach the corresponding 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.049
 depths 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.819
 vbd pp 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.819
 PC 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.869
 and begin the series of long calmly 

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:19.269
 sleep well to the turnaround stop repair 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.360
 time which our bait who no 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.710
 n 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.819
 everyone knows that one of their favorite places 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.330
 Turkish parking lot 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.449
 community 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.099
 if it is not too thick you can risk 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.249
 in the bait request directly to the ground 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.519
 and wait one two seconds then 

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:45.049
 start making grow vertex critic 

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:48.049
 raised high up 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.680
 So 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680
 fc 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.340
 corpse 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.960
 n pursuing the bait of reeds gradually 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.770
 goes down as a joke below allows 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.770
 man will work 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.340
 n very productive and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.800
 proven perfection by him 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.710
 wiring is the inclusion of delicate 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.430
 wrist movement 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.830
 which give movement bait 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.050
 somewhat more energy 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.759
 it helps a lot with both 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.330
 local budget 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
 0 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 but 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.669
 not 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.249
 both versions also confront 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.569
 high requirements for anglers 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.289
 regarding control for slack and 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.300
 Levski 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.710
 so after each thieves or poteshki 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.370
 try to position the rod and 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.610
 forest floor one line to maximize 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.919
 reduce the lure distance and remove 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.849
 slack ul Finnish should not limp 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.400
 lying on the surface since very 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.400
 just in this case miss the bites 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.520
 tons everybody who dreams of big 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.080
 food must have their 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.080
 short straw jack 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.430
 gut 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.589
 Yu
