Hey everyone, Jason here, today I'm excited to show you my latest LEGO creations,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.520
which are these gravity powered walking
animals.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.189
These are extremely simple mechanical
devices

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.809
that are based off some traditional
wooden toys

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.640
that I stumbled across online one night.
So how exactly do these work.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.260
We'll take a look at the duck first, which
is basically just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.430
two hinged parts: the body and the front leg

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.380
are rigidly connected and the rear leg is just allowed to

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.079
swing freely on a hinge and if we

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.250
pull the legs out you can see that it's
just

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.610
a basic Technic pin and a couple

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.890
of Technic pieces, and that's all there is to it.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.360
So we'll take a closer look at this in action. I can actually take the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.710
side of the duck off and put the legs back in,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.140
and that way we can see exactly what's going on

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
as it walks. So there are three important
aspects to the design

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.250
which make it all work together. The first is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.140
the curved feet, which allow the model to rock back and forth

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.790
just like a rocking chair. The second is

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.299
the swinging rear leg, and it's actually important that it's constrained in its path which is

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.480
kind of built in to the design of the duck, but I'll explain that a little bit more in the kangaroo model.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.009
Third is that the center of gravity of the
body needs to be

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.880
at or just above the pivot point on the rear leg, and that's so that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.430
when it rocks backwards onto the rear leg the body can tilt

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.659
back, which actually kicks the front foot forward

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.939
and that way when it comes back

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.070
to the front it actually takes a step.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.500
So when you put it all together you get this cool little walking motion.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.760
So I'll run it again and slow the video down and that way you can really see what's going on.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.620
If we take a look at the kangaroo model,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.830
you can see that the legs are on either
side of the body

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.880
which means there's no built-in
constraints to where the legs can swing,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.340
and it just doesn't work properly. You
need some way to constrain the legs

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.720
so that the feet get planted in the
correct position

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.390
for it to walk properly. So the way I
achieved that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.400
is by connecting the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.150
rear legs together using this Technic axle

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.700
and it is allowed to swing through

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.630
a gap at the bottom of the body. In that way

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.850
the leg swing is constrained

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.260
and the animal can walk properly.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.480
If you'd like to build either of these
models yourself I have created

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.470
step-by-step building instructions which
you can find on my website

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.070
at jkbrickworks.com. I'll add a link in the
description

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.769
and at the end of the video. One note, if you do

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.130
build them yourself I am running them on
a piece of foam

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.670
on top of a piece of cardboard, and that is because LEGO is extremely slippery.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.410
So without piece of foam or piece of cloth

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.740
they'll just slide more than walk

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.670
down the slope. So that's about all there is to it, I hope you enjoyed these models

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.160
and the video. Thanks for watching, keep on building

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.970
and I'll see you next time.
