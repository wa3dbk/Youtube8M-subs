without further ado let's bring out the

without further ado let's bring out the
Steve<00:00:07.160> I<00:00:07.310> think<00:00:07.520> you<00:00:07.609> all<00:00:07.790> are<00:00:07.819> here<00:00:08.149> to<00:00:08.389> see

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
Steve I think you all are here to see

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:27.939 
Steve I think you all are here to see
Steve<00:00:10.460> Jobs<00:00:26.199> market<00:00:27.199> valuation<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:27.890> we

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
Steve Jobs market valuation and we

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:28.929 
Steve Jobs market valuation and we
thought<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:28.130> might<00:00:28.310> have<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.490> thought<00:00:28.730> or<00:00:28.789> two

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
thought you might have a thought or two

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.250 
thought you might have a thought or two
about<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:34.420> for<00:00:35.420> those<00:00:35.600> of<00:00:35.780> us<00:00:35.900> that<00:00:35.930> have<00:00:36.140> been

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
about it for those of us that have been

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.729 
about it for those of us that have been
in<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.440> industry<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.830> long<00:00:36.980> time<00:00:37.219> it's<00:00:37.460> surreal

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
in the industry a long time it's surreal

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.720 
in the industry a long time it's surreal
but<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:40.790> doesn't<00:00:41.450> matter<00:00:41.690> very<00:00:41.719> much<00:00:42.340> so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
but it doesn't matter very much so

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.950 
but it doesn't matter very much so
you<00:00:44.180> published<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.719> long<00:00:45.430> open<00:00:46.430> letter

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
you published a long open letter

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.729 
you published a long open letter
something<00:00:47.960> like<00:00:48.200> what<00:00:48.379> did<00:00:48.469> you<00:00:48.500> call<00:00:48.680> it

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
something like what did you call it

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.709 
something like what did you call it
thoughts<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.340> flash<00:00:49.670> or<00:00:50.000> something<00:00:50.390> like<00:00:50.480> that

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
thoughts on flash or something like that

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.310 
thoughts on flash or something like that
so<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:51.770> you've<00:00:52.190> clearly<00:00:52.960> stated<00:00:53.960> your<00:00:54.079> case

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
so you you've clearly stated your case

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.799 
so you you've clearly stated your case
there<00:00:54.649> is<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.219> really<00:00:55.250> fair<00:00:55.940> or<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.600> best

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
there is it really fair or the best

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.560 
there is it really fair or the best
thing<00:00:56.989> for<00:00:57.140> consumers<00:00:58.100> who<00:00:58.399> buy<00:00:58.430> say<00:00:59.059> an<00:00:59.149> iPad

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
thing for consumers who buy say an iPad

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.069 
thing for consumers who buy say an iPad
or<00:00:59.600> an<00:00:59.989> iPhone<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:01.100> just<00:01:01.340> be<00:01:01.489> abrupt<00:01:01.989> Apple<00:01:02.989> is

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
or an iPhone to just be abrupt Apple is

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.969 
or an iPhone to just be abrupt Apple is
a<00:01:03.170> company<00:01:03.620> that<00:01:03.910> has<00:01:05.470> doesn't<00:01:06.470> have<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.830> most

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
a company that has doesn't have the most

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.140 
a company that has doesn't have the most
resources<00:01:07.399> of<00:01:07.910> everybody<00:01:08.509> in<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.720> world<00:01:08.750> and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
resources of everybody in the world and

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.109 
resources of everybody in the world and
the<00:01:11.150> way<00:01:11.330> we've<00:01:11.650> succeeded<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:13.040> by<00:01:13.640> choosing

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
the way we've succeeded is by choosing

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.510 
the way we've succeeded is by choosing
what<00:01:14.570> horses<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.260> ride<00:01:15.470> really<00:01:15.860> carefully

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
what horses to ride really carefully

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.460 
what horses to ride really carefully
technically<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.720> try<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:17.990> look<00:01:18.170> for<00:01:18.229> these

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
technically we try to look for these

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.530 
technically we try to look for these
technical<00:01:18.979> vectors<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:20.330> have<00:01:20.509> a

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
technical vectors that that have a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.980 
technical vectors that that have a
future<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.189> are<00:01:22.280> headed<00:01:22.759> up<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.270> you

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
future and that are headed up and you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.499 
future and that are headed up and you
know<00:01:24.110> technology<00:01:25.119> different<00:01:26.119> pieces<00:01:26.360> of

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
know technology different pieces of

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.160 
know technology different pieces of
technology<00:01:27.430> kind<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.580> go<00:01:28.759> in<00:01:28.970> cycles<00:01:29.420> they

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
technology kind of go in cycles they

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.590 
technology kind of go in cycles they
have<00:01:30.380> their<00:01:30.590> their<00:01:31.130> Springs<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.970> summers<00:01:32.180> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
have their their Springs and summers and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.499 
have their their Springs and summers and
autumns<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.229> then<00:01:33.560> they<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:35.000> know<00:01:35.119> go<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:35.329> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
autumns and then they you know go to the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.370 
autumns and then they you know go to the
graveyard<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.229> Technology<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.140> try<00:01:39.350> to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
graveyard of Technology and so we try to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.780 
graveyard of Technology and so we try to
pick<00:01:39.619> things<00:01:39.799> that<00:01:40.009> are<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.189> there<00:01:40.310> Springs

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
pick things that are in there Springs

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.929 
pick things that are in there Springs
and<00:01:41.439> if<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.680> choose<00:01:43.100> wisely

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
and if you choose wisely

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.600 
and if you choose wisely
you<00:01:44.630> can<00:01:44.810> save<00:01:45.110> yourself<00:01:45.290> an<00:01:45.740> enormous<00:01:46.310> amount

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
you can save yourself an enormous amount

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.190 
you can save yourself an enormous amount
of<00:01:46.670> work<00:01:46.850> versus<00:01:47.450> trying<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.750> do<00:01:47.840> everything

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
of work versus trying to do everything

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100 
of work versus trying to do everything
so<00:01:48.649> we<00:01:49.460> have<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.610> history<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.180> doing<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.750> as<00:01:50.960> an

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
so we have a history of doing that as an

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.069 
so we have a history of doing that as an
example<00:01:51.549> we<00:01:52.549> went<00:01:53.180> from<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.509> five<00:01:53.810> inch

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
example we went from the five inch

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.990 
example we went from the five inch
floppy<00:01:54.409> disk<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.070> three-and-a-half<00:01:55.790> inch

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
floppy disk to the three-and-a-half inch

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.539 
floppy disk to the three-and-a-half inch
floppy<00:01:56.270> disk<00:01:56.600> with<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.840> Mac<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.549> sometimes

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
floppy disk with the Mac and sometimes

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.950 
floppy disk with the Mac and sometimes
when<00:01:58.790> we<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:59.060> rid<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.360> things<00:01:59.509> like<00:01:59.659> the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
when we get rid of things like the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.810 
when we get rid of things like the
floppy<00:02:00.229> disk<00:02:00.590> drive<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.219> original<00:02:01.579> iMac

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
floppy disk drive on the original iMac

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.679 
floppy disk drive on the original iMac
people<00:02:02.210> call<00:02:02.420> us<00:02:02.600> crazy<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:04.119> sometimes<00:02:05.119> you

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
people call us crazy but sometimes you

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.840 
people call us crazy but sometimes you
just<00:02:05.719> have<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.619> pick<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.130> things<00:02:07.399> that<00:02:07.549> look

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
just have to pick the things that look

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.850 
just have to pick the things that look
like<00:02:08.030> they're<00:02:08.239> going<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:09.649> right

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
like they're going to be the right

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.310 
like they're going to be the right
horses<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.459> ride<00:02:10.610> going<00:02:10.970> forward<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.540> and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
horses to ride going forward and and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.309 
horses to ride going forward and and
flash<00:02:12.860> looks<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> technology<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.989> had

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
flash looks like a technology that had

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.670 
flash looks like a technology that had
it<00:02:15.500> today<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.879> really<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.780> waning

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it today but is really on is waning

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.100 
it today but is really on is waning
and<00:02:18.909> html5<00:02:19.909> looks<00:02:20.330> like<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.750> technology

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and html5 looks like the technology

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.140 
and html5 looks like the technology
that's<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:22.099> on<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> ascendancy<00:02:22.819> right

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
that's really on the ascendancy right

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
that's really on the ascendancy right
now<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.959> also<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.260> development<00:02:24.830> environment

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
now it's also a development environment

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.009 
now it's also a development environment
and<00:02:25.400> there<00:02:25.640> are<00:02:25.700> entire<00:02:25.970> websites<00:02:26.720> some<00:02:26.959> of

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
and there are entire websites some of
