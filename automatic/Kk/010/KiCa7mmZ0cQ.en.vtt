00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.319
 is very good youtube here I am commenting 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.790
 and this is a game a little different from 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.770
 what we are used to is not a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 nuclear but that is a game of matta 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.480
 matta of these with molan 182 2 that is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.010
 more 82 kill me twice as you see 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.349
 streaky stitches we return a little 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.849
 gust touches is I wanted to kill and good 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.890
 here playing only in low confirmed in 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.029
 kill 82 people in about 6 minutes and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.859
 something therefore the truth that is enough 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.079
 well you will see that there is a time 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.519
 suicide with the drone hunters pc like 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.839
 in the video is the TV or what I did but 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 well it's understandable that the 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.749
 swarm can sometimes kill you though 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.550
 It is rare because it kills me inside 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.020
 a house and I get pretty pissed but good 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.520
 nothing happens because I could be hurt 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.290
 some low that works more if not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 I would have killed myself with that drone because 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.930
 It was close to the Rocha again 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.830
 but as you will see, the streak was 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.440
 pretty fast 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.850
 the enemies will be a dumb fools and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.080
 they were put off the map because this 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 map you know that the inside part of 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.110
 the gusts can almost never give you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 except if you are below the whole thing there is 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.079
 a glass window above and they are all 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 while outside the pots of the time 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.560
 charging with the gusts I do not know the truth 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.060
 it's not that they were very good 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.280
 and then I could take advantage and can take 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.200
 a very good game you see low 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.579
 confirmed in express lately 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.739
 some games are coming out of the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.780
 nuclear host on this separate map 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 because it's a map really, really 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 simple has 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.670
 we are clear that I will explain it more 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.289
 in a video that I have the one that I'm going to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.079
 announce right now that I took out yesterday 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.609
 twitter and I'll explain what they say is 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.869
 an easy map to play it 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.369
 explain the map guide but what 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.719
 explain domain mode and do not explain it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.090
 in duel by teams down confirmed 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.610
 then well let's announce before 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 I forget the video touches me 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.500
 announce and well as you know I told you 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.880
 yesterday we reached 20,000 subscribers 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 thank you very much everyone and I have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 pending to do this weekend the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.959
 Sunday a streaming of league games 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 with my team so you can see a little 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.069
 as a league game and all that live to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.890
 say it can be 2.0 if I can mount it 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.479
 ok the camera and all that and apart the 2 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.429
 of July that the new maps of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.099
 zombies the new pack of maps with the 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.140
 several zombies, surely also 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.270
 Stream 2.0 July 2 for the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.649
 late on 5 so well it's not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.879
 tense the channel because you will have streaming 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.259
 and I'm also going to do a streaming of 

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.879
 playing with you who owed you the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.710
 special 25,000 apart from what so 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.510
 league that will surely be 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.209
 after exams is to say starting 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.730
 of the 10 July dialogue from 10 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.319
 July 12th there I'll do another streaming 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.760
 of playing with voices so they're going to be 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.350
 a few weeks with streaming I think 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.880
 that the channel is quite good 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.170
 also notifying by twitter if not 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.850
 you know my twitter and you have twitter and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.410
 Well, how do I use a lot of twitter? 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.360
 so much to do to solve your 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.880
 doubts as to announce things so what 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.290
 you have in the description just like the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.180
 code page and all that always 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.040
 I leave other videos that we may think 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.750
 interesting in these in all the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.190
 description and good that the video I'm going to 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.709
 announce well I get a nuclear 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.959
 with the x pr 50 is to say the fair of 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.720
 sniper that does more and markel than 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.660
 something else 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.580
 I do not know in this one with the thermal average 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.220
 playing with a team of three 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.480
 people low confirmed a mode of 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 very difficult game happens almost nuclear me 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.690
 exclusively to 30 sniper 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.860
 low with the sniper just one 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.320
 knife but good as it is a streak of 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.310
 31 killed one with the knife and then killed 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.690
 to another with the sniper to 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.460
 compensate so the 30 with the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.080
 sniper one thing in my opinion very 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.790
 difficult and playing low confirmed then 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.650
 harder still that I'm going to save it 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.720
 for the special 30,000 subscribers as well 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.290
 that you already know when we reached 30,000 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.000
 subscribers 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.620
 I have commented on that video I will explain a 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.540
 it responds little how this works 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.890
 map and well I have half the video left 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 to talk a little bit about what has 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.430
 been the e3 and the games that have come out 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.500
 that can be interesting not and talk 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.090
 a little bit about consoles like 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.280
 news I have to give that as you knew 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 the xbox said that he was going to put us 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.400
 second hand the games were going to be very 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.230
 limited of region you have to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.670
 connect every day so that things 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.380
 the console so to speak does not explode 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.170
 but or something and not at the end have 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.730
 rectified have said that the console does not 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.380
 will have limit of regions 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.910
 of high school buys a game in usa what 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.680
 you can use here thing that with the xbox 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.480
 3 in so could not the games of 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.980
 second hand you can buy game 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.860
 second hand have also rectified that 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.810
 appearance 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.400
 and the topic of online does not have to be 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.010
 the console is connected every day to 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.930
 online so that it does not work or so that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.700
 do not give problems so no problem 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.670
 all the problems that xbox had 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.890
 in front of sony by the mentioned thing and thing 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.030
 that earns enough cash so good 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.710
 here I think it's when I commit suicide with 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.120
 the drone you see how it comes in through the window 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.410
 and the fucking bastard bursts me and 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.160
 well then from here to the end without 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.350
 dying leaving that aside 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.209
 that I'm going to buy myself is the question 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.700
 Well, good to buy both but I 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.470
 I have a preference for the xbox xbox one 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.000
 it's going to be worth only 100 euros, good 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.980
 it will only be worth 100 euros more than the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.250
 playstation 4 to playstation 4 is worth 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.420
 400 dollars euros because in Europe you 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.160
 they are going to put more expensive you know that the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.920
 change from euros to dollars as it is more 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.780
 the euro currency has more value 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.520
 will be worth more in principle than in 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.230
 these years for example and then the xbox 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.020
 as I have asserted 100 euros more or 100 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.420
 dollars plus 500 so I have 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.220
 priority over the xbox and personally 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.780
 I think it 's something more complete because 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.330
 has the kinect and for being animal a little 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.680
 more expensive has better system and all that 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 so also it has a little more 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.550
 value and respect to the three games that 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.200
 they have seemed good to me I am going to make you a 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.660
 top 5 of the games that I've seen that I 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.830
 I will almost certainly buy the one that most 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.990
 has attracted attention number 2 that more 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.690
 it caught my attention is that of sting and it's 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.370
 a kind of halo or mixed with the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.750
 edge of the games that the two that I 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.280
 they like it very much and it seemed very 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.350
 interesting the gameplay that went up like this 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.120
 that surely also falls is the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.740
 folk titan who is from the creators of 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.510
 call of duty 4 for me the best call of 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.550
 team duty 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.200
 respawn I think they are called and the truth 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.790
 is that he did not see an interesting game 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.020
 a bit futuristic but you have to give it 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.630
 the opportunity because it looks like a game 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.910
 then I am also very impressed by the 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.590
 metal gear 5 the new metal gear that 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.640
 before he has written for playstation 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.110
 for sony but now he has bought 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.880
 microsoft that has the sensitivity of 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.550
 metal gear so another super game 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.900
 interesting another game that called me 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.160
 also very much the attention because to 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.230
 I really like the theme of zombies and 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.270
 such was the die racing 3 I played at one 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.220
 and I liked it a lot but 3 has a world 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.510
 opened a lot of possibilities of 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.610
 survival that is what I do not like 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.440
 the zombies in both series and games 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.270
 apart from the zombie arcade of 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.680
 calotti that are a little arcade me 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.680
 like that aspect of survival that 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.380
 they give the games that kind of power 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.180
 design different strategies for that 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.500
 to survive different weapons is going to 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.700
 be very interesting as well as you 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.560
 I say an open world then explore 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.770
 houses and such a very complete many 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.390
 zombies and I do not know those games good part 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.620
 from battlefield 4 who called me also 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.630
 very much attention the subject of the
