tutorial so a lot of people might be

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.120 
tutorial so a lot of people might be
familiar<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.580> how<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.890> vehicle's<00:00:16.890> repair

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
familiar with how the vehicle's repair

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
familiar with how the vehicle's repair
themselves<00:00:17.779> but<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> few<00:00:19.410> things<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
themselves but there's a few things that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400 
themselves but there's a few things that
you<00:00:20.100> may<00:00:20.400> not<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:20.970> know<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:22.320> we're

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you may not actually know what we're

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.349 
you may not actually know what we're
going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.519> tests<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
going to do is do some tests on this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.320 
going to do is do some tests on this
tank<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:24.900> here<00:00:25.189> gremlins<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> show

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
tank right here gremlins going to show

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.410 
tank right here gremlins going to show
you<00:00:27.390> exactly<00:00:28.320> how<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.369> destruction<00:00:30.029> works<00:00:30.210> if

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
you exactly how the destruction works if

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.770 
you exactly how the destruction works if
you<00:00:31.109> disable<00:00:31.920> available<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> catches<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.480> fire

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
you disable available it catches on fire

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.740 
you disable available it catches on fire
so<00:00:34.680> then<00:00:35.340> that's<00:00:35.610> something<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.719> sure

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
so then that's something that I'm sure

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200 
so then that's something that I'm sure
probably<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.309> seen<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.760> it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
probably a lot of you have seen and it's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.299 
probably a lot of you have seen and it's
that<00:00:39.660> vehicle<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.290> repaired<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> will

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that vehicle is not repaired and will

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
that vehicle is not repaired and will
continue<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.120> down<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> help<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.290> you'll

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
continue to go down and help so you'll

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.160 
continue to go down and help so you'll
see<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:43.860> now<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.670> pretty<00:00:45.140> low<00:00:46.140> on

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
see right now that we're pretty low on

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
see right now that we're pretty low on
health<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> its<00:00:47.039> continuing<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.789> down

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
health and its continuing to go down

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
health and its continuing to go down
because<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.600> vehicle<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.110> fire<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
because the vehicle is on fire so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.580 
because the vehicle is on fire so
gremlin<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> repair<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
gremlin is going to repair it what you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.700 
gremlin is going to repair it what you
may<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.899> watch<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.140> he<00:00:55.260> does<00:00:55.289> he

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
may not know is watch what he does he

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.049 
may not know is watch what he does he
only<00:00:55.860> repairs<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> seventy<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.030> percent

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
only repairs it to seventy two percent

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.590 
only repairs it to seventy two percent
so<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> outside<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:59.280> fire<00:00:59.640> but

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so on the outside there is no fire but

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
so on the outside there is no fire but
because<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.980> already<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.550> fire<00:01:02.879> there

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
because there was already a fire there

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.770 
because there was already a fire there
it's<00:01:03.809> still<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.100> lower<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.790> health<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it's still going to lower and health so

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830 
it's still going to lower and health so
if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.830> engineer<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.299> have

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
if you are an engineer you actually have

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
if you are an engineer you actually have
if<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.860> vehicle<00:01:11.100> becomes<00:01:11.430> disabled<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
if the vehicle becomes disabled and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
if the vehicle becomes disabled and
you're<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.869> engineer<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.189> repair

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you're an engineer you have to repair

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
you're an engineer you have to repair
that<00:01:14.729> vehicle<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.020> hundred<00:01:16.290> percent

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that vehicle back to one hundred percent

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.840 
that vehicle back to one hundred percent
in<00:01:17.159> order<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> stop<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.659> fire<00:01:18.930> completely<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
in order to stop the fire completely so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.370 
in order to stop the fire completely so
a<00:01:20.880> lot<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> people<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.570> may<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.049> aware<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a lot of people that may not be aware of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.649 
a lot of people that may not be aware of
that<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> don't<00:01:23.909> disable<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that because if you don't disable the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
that because if you don't disable the
vehicle<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.470> damage<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> little

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
vehicle and you just damage it a little

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.230 
vehicle and you just damage it a little
bit<00:01:26.930> then<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.680> vehicle<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.520> repair<00:01:30.060> itself

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
bit then the vehicle will repair itself

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.789 
bit then the vehicle will repair itself
and<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> maintenance<00:01:31.650> on

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and people can have a maintenance on

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
and people can have a maintenance on
that<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.159> help<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.180> repair<00:01:33.630> itself<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that will help it repair itself so you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.460 
that will help it repair itself so you
know<00:01:34.590> anything<00:01:35.189> above<00:01:35.909> disabled<00:01:36.720> it'll<00:01:37.290> do

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
know anything above disabled it'll do

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.670 
know anything above disabled it'll do
that<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.340> once<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> vehicle<00:01:39.360> becomes

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
that but once the vehicle becomes

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.800 
that but once the vehicle becomes
disabled<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.880> repair<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
disabled you have to repair it back to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
disabled you have to repair it back to
one<00:01:42.930> hundred<00:01:43.049> percent<00:01:43.280> otherwise<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.579> can

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
one hundred percent otherwise you can

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.499 
one hundred percent otherwise you can
get<00:01:44.909> back<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.590> may<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:48.329> in

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
get back in it and it may not go down in

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
get back in it and it may not go down in
health<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.170> first<00:01:49.710> couple<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.159> seconds

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
health for the first couple of seconds

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.330 
health for the first couple of seconds
but<00:01:51.000> eventually<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.040> start

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
but eventually it is going to start

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.270 
but eventually it is going to start
decreasing<00:01:53.909> notice<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.200> bumped<00:01:56.159> me<00:01:56.250> up

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
decreasing notice here he bumped me up

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.999 
decreasing notice here he bumped me up
to<00:01:56.399> ninety<00:01:56.820> three<00:01:57.000> percent<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:58.860> you're

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
to ninety three percent and then you're

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.560 
to ninety three percent and then you're
going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> notice<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
going to notice that it's just going to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
going to notice that it's just going to
start<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.110> back<00:02:01.409> down<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.850> a
