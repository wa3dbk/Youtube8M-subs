all-wheel drive the FJ was designed to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.640 
all-wheel drive the FJ was designed to

appealing to those places is that

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.930 
appealing to those places is that
neither<00:03:27.440> seem<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:27.950> care<00:03:28.220> about<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.610> price<00:03:28.910> of

mud easier and it does that by smoothly
controlling<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.670> braking<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.270> the

controlling the braking and the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.760 
controlling the braking and the
acceleration<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.140> all<00:04:49.260> you<00:04:49.380> have<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.560> do<00:04:49.650> is

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770

concentrate<00:04:50.100> on<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.520> steering<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.690> here<00:04:51.840> to

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
concentrate on the steering so here to

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.690 
concentrate on the steering so here to

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
have also fitted an extra fuel tank so

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.190 
have also fitted an extra fuel tank so
you<00:04:53.880> now<00:04:54.090> get<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.330> total<00:04:54.690> of<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.810> hundred<00:04:54.840> and

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
you now get a total of a hundred and
