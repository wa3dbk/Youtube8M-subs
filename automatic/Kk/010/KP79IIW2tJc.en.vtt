00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
are more like poker cards because

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.200 
are more like poker cards because

durability<00:01:39.680> like<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:41.310> cards<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:41.790> last

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
durability like these cards will last

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
durability like these cards will last
you<00:01:42.270> forever<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.259> sure<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.530> white

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
you forever I'm not sure if that white

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240 
you forever I'm not sure if that white
will<00:01:44.130> last<00:01:44.369> forever<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:46.250> white

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
will last forever but you know white

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.230 
will last forever but you know white
never<00:01:47.490> last

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
never last

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.410 
never last
but<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:48.960> reason<00:01:49.460> black<00:01:50.460> never<00:01:50.970> lasts

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
but for some reason black never lasts

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.490 
but for some reason black never lasts
you<00:01:51.479> they're<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you they're like you're going to get a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.249 
you they're like you're going to get a
black<00:01:53.369> deck<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.600> reason<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> edges

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
black deck for some reason the edges

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.160 
black deck for some reason the edges
will<00:01:55.439> end<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.740> white<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.509> if

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
will end up white so I don't know and if
