00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
think we may just find also an odd

think we may just find also an odd
shower<00:00:46.230> developing<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.800> parts<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
southeast England it could be a heavy

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.330 
southeast England it could be a heavy
one<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> thunder<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.190> but

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
one it could be a thunder one but

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
one it could be a thunder one but
probably<00:00:50.670> only<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.910> 20%<00:00:51.300> chance<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> most

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
of seeing one oh there is the more

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
of seeing one oh there is the more
persistent<00:00:54.030> rain<00:00:54.480> coming<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.440> across<00:00:55.739> the

western side of Scotland well I think

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
western side of Scotland well I think
the<00:00:59.850> most<00:01:00.030> place<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
bad evening in the eastern districts we

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.100 
bad evening in the eastern districts we
will<00:01:02.850> find<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> rain<00:01:03.420> gradually<00:01:03.870> pushing

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
will find that rain gradually pushing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
will find that rain gradually pushing
slowly<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.670> into<00:01:05.939> the
