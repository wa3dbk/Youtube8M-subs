00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
those guys are i'm preaching but that's

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.960 
those guys are i'm preaching but that's
not<00:04:15.470> food<00:04:15.650> important<00:04:16.010> because<00:04:16.100> tricks<00:04:16.790> are

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
not food important because tricks are

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.479 
not food important because tricks are
not<00:04:17.359> heavily<00:04:17.660> armored<00:04:18.079> anyway<00:04:18.950> since<00:04:19.190> he's

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
not heavily armored anyway since he's

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.670
