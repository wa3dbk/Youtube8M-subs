the many things that I try to strive for

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.410 
the many things that I try to strive for
in<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.130> rig<00:00:05.730> or<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.000> setup<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:07.160> just<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.580> know<00:00:08.760> you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
in a rig or a setup is just you know you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.959 
in a rig or a setup is just you know you
see<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> lot<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> petals<00:00:10.290> here<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.730> same

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
see a lot of petals here but at the same

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.440 
see a lot of petals here but at the same
time<00:00:12.150> they're<00:00:12.389> wired<00:00:13.080> very<00:00:13.440> simplistic<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
time they're wired very simplistic and I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.720 
time they're wired very simplistic and I
try<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.650> know<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.859> I'm<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:17.310> playing<00:00:17.490> in

the studio or if I'm you know getting
hired<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> do<00:00:21.570> something<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.260> try<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> get<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
hired to do something I try to get a

hired to do something I try to get a
variety<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.939> different<00:00:24.119> things<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
variety of different things and that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
variety of different things and that
means<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> pedals<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:27.000> need

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
means the pedals that I have they need

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.439 
means the pedals that I have they need
to<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.449> very<00:00:27.660> versatile<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.179> you<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.300> when

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
to be very versatile and you know when

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.580 
to be very versatile and you know when
you're<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:30.869> you're<00:00:30.960> trying<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.289> build<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you're when you're trying to build a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.400 
you're when you're trying to build a
pedal<00:00:31.890> board<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.780> you<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
pedal board you know you really want to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
pedal board you know you really want to
try<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.460> effects<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.510> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
try to have the effects that that can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
try to have the effects that that can
get<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> job<00:00:37.680> done<00:00:37.710> obviously<00:00:38.160> whether<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
get the job done obviously whether it's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.229 
get the job done obviously whether it's
on<00:00:39.390> stage<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> studio<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:42.120> I've

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
on stage or in the studio and what I've

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.910 
on stage or in the studio and what I've
got<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.870> probably<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
got is this this is probably one of my

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
got is this this is probably one of my
other<00:00:47.309> than<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> Trinity<00:00:48.300> pedal<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:50.460> unit

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
other than the Trinity pedal this unit

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.350 
other than the Trinity pedal this unit
right<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:52.110> actually<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:53.520> true<00:00:54.000> bypass

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
right here is actually a true bypass

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.459 
right here is actually a true bypass
looper<00:00:55.190> by<00:00:56.190> Cusack<00:00:56.789> effects<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
looper by Cusack effects and it is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170 
looper by Cusack effects and it is
probably<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> coolest<00:00:59.280> looper<00:00:59.879> I've<00:01:00.000> ever

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
probably the coolest looper I've ever

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.219 
probably the coolest looper I've ever
seen<00:01:01.789> essentially<00:01:02.789> you've<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
seen essentially you've got it's a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
seen essentially you've got it's a
programmable<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.100> an<00:01:05.220> analog<00:01:05.610> programmable

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
programmable it's an analog programmable

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.359 
programmable it's an analog programmable
looper<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:08.340> allows<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> dial<00:01:09.240> in

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
looper that allows me to dial in

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.240 
looper that allows me to dial in
different<00:01:12.140> pedals<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.439> any<00:01:13.619> given<00:01:13.950> point<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
different pedals at any given point in

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
different pedals at any given point in
time<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.229> process

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
time as you can see I'm in the process

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.969 
time as you can see I'm in the process
of<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.310> taking<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.790> Banshee<00:01:18.450> off

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
of actually taking this Banshee off

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.990 
of actually taking this Banshee off
because<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.189> use<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> much<00:01:20.670> right

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because I don't use it that much right

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.310 
because I don't use it that much right
now<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:21.750> getting<00:01:21.960> ready<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> put<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
now and I'm getting ready to put a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
now and I'm getting ready to put a
rotary<00:01:23.009> pedal<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.479> will<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
rotary pedal on there which will be

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.170 
rotary pedal on there which will be
really<00:01:24.810> cool<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.880> one's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
really cool and that's what this one's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.350 
really cool and that's what this one's
gonna<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.060> pretty

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
gonna do but you know it's pretty

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.060 
gonna do but you know it's pretty
standard<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> couple<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> over<00:01:31.829> drives

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
standard to have a couple of over drives

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.749 
standard to have a couple of over drives
on<00:01:32.310> board<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> Trinity<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> definitely<00:01:35.070> my

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
on board the Trinity is definitely my

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.429 
on board the Trinity is definitely my
main<00:01:35.970> overdrive<00:01:36.619> for<00:01:37.619> rhythm<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:39.240> lead<00:01:39.439> or

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
main overdrive for rhythm or lead or

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.370 
main overdrive for rhythm or lead or
textural<00:01:41.310> parts<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> tube<00:01:43.170> screamer

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
textural parts it's not a tube screamer

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.060 
textural parts it's not a tube screamer
and<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.189> therefore<00:01:45.079> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and so therefore you know it's just a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
and so therefore you know it's just a
different<00:01:47.310> pedal<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:47.939> love<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
different pedal and i love it and it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
different pedal and i love it and it's
my<00:01:49.140> main<00:01:49.320> drive<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> probably<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.520> my

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
my main drive and it probably will be my

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.230 
my main drive and it probably will be my
main<00:01:51.000> drive<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:52.470> long<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.680> i<00:01:52.890> play<00:01:53.240> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
main drive for as long as i play and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
main drive for as long as i play and
then<00:01:54.720> I've<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> full<00:01:55.259> drive<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.399> I'm

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
then I've got a full drive and I'm

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.660 
then I've got a full drive and I'm
running<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:58.680> Trinity<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> be

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
running the Trinity this is going to be

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.010 
running the Trinity this is going to be
the<00:01:59.790> higher<00:02:00.000> gain<00:02:00.329> pedal<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:00.869> running

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the higher gain pedal and I'm running

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
the higher gain pedal and I'm running
that<00:02:01.259> behind<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.399> lower<00:02:02.610> game<00:02:02.880> pedal<00:02:03.180> this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that behind the lower game pedal this

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.149 
that behind the lower game pedal this

drive<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.060> pretty<00:02:06.240> low<00:02:06.829> my<00:02:07.829> tone<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.399> volume<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
drive is pretty low my tone and volume I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
drive is pretty low my tone and volume I
try<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> keep<00:02:09.330> my<00:02:09.390> tone<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> volume<00:02:09.959> fairly

try to keep my tone and volume fairly
similar<00:02:11.000> but<00:02:12.000> i'm<00:02:12.150> only<00:02:12.270> running<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
similar but i'm only running it on the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
similar but i'm only running it on the
green

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
green

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.200 
green
so<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.100> very<00:02:14.220> light<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.820> it's<00:02:14.940> got<00:02:15.060> just

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
so it's very very light so it's got just

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.330 
so it's very very light so it's got just
a<00:02:15.360> little<00:02:15.390> bit<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.720> hair<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:17.070> would<00:02:17.310> be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
a little bit of hair and that would be

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.900 
a little bit of hair and that would be
this<00:02:17.940> setting<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.650> I'm<00:02:20.250> running<00:02:20.520> straight

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
this setting and I'm running straight

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.710 
this setting and I'm running straight
into<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:22.280> looper<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:24.000> when<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> engage

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
into the looper and I'm when I engage

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.690 
into the looper and I'm when I engage
like<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.290> sound<00:02:25.560> I've<00:02:25.800> got<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.280> full<00:02:26.460> drive

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
like this sound I've got the full drive

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.640 
like this sound I've got the full drive
plus<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.840> compressor<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:31.230> i<00:02:31.350> want<00:02:31.590> to
