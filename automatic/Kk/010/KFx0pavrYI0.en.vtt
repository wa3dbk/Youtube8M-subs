 then add everyone there if you want 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.299
 Being fired by me already adds me 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.220
 I will not be going apart later 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.909
 my friend code is only through this video 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.990

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.780
 And if you added me there, man, just boot. 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 So what do you add to me? 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.930
 remembering that you do not have to have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.520
 Pokémon to add beauty not not 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.530
 has no need 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.599
 but anyway you go there write us 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.090

 friend code beauty I'll go there and add you 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.990
 If you did not add me

 They forget to give way before come by such 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.240
 comment there already added the 3ds and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.120
 Wait, I 'll add you and that's it. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.890
 That's right from the frank coates and I do not 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.200
 I know I'm spinning in circles 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.490
 or framed or I know inside the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.900
 hell do not you think someone went 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.709
 recorded and not making this live 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.030
 bagasse is bad but finally the second 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.400
 matter is the question that has some 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.220
 pokémons that I would like very much 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.220
 dt and I'll make the list for you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.250
 now the first pokemon I want 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.310
 a lot is a sport or so you have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.739
 the sport a turtle pokémon gives a 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.320
 Existing laughter negotiates you in good 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.840
 faith to appear in the series that the Pokémon 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.819
 You gave it to me, I'll show you a video. 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.050
 then all the exchanges I make after 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:07.110
 made logical not 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.200
 here is a ranking of 18 the first 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.880
 Pokémon there, you've heard Scotus 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.790
 Safe Pokemon I'm wondering is 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.500
 ronet bonetti is that sword and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.630
 remembering that of the pokémons that I asked for 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.310
 can be either this specific pokémon 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.989
 the evolution of it makes no difference 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.579
 If you can ask for a scorpion you have the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.549
 hotel for me is good 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.940
 the person interested in the last stage is not 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.180
 The third Pokemon I really want is 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.040
 a nobel says norbert there to the form 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.690
 of that dragon bat is that 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.320
 Now came a physical Pokémon or not 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.970
 I'll catch you, not if you have it. 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.579
 You'll let me know, I'll explain the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.079
 you how you my vision is 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.540
 Another Pokemon I Want To Quit 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.340
 the fourth pokémon is a hip i like a lot 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.109
 of amphoras have not found my hips yet 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.230
 same jones partner with trauma 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.299
 I do not remember and I have to 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.859
 stone there for me tomorrow forums would not 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.540
 interesting to test this option besides is 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.640
 Of course I think I already use it for 10 5th 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.200
 Pokemon I want is an Abra can be 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.660
 a work can be a corpse was so much 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.630
 even makes a house of passage to 1 kw he 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.239
 for the better house yet 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.419
 and then as sixth pokémon 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.700
 I want a CIHDOTT if I had evolve 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.470
 free us and then practice all this not 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.630
 I 'm wrong, I do not know if this version 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.280
 so if you have my life there, and 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.220
 we 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.230
 7th pokémon bell of the 1st beldon that after 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.330
 will come the metalurh the metallic pokémon there 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.740
 I really want it, I like it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.680
 a lot of thick bush that I had a 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.660
 deck is based on gross goals once 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.960
 when to play pokémon that is in letters 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.150
 even so online and we'll see if you 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.790
 You have to clean it up, man. 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.990
 another pokémon that I want very much is the 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.330
 eighth né 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.090
 I really really want a lot of it is an era 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.220
 cross kahn was cross I think it's sensational 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.170
 even more now that it's out that he has 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.240
 an evolution was a child I found a lot 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.370
 very strong because the insect with 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.510
 fighters attacks and if you have, let's go 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.440
 negotiate right 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.910
 the name pokémon is a mixed teams 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.800
 I recorded there it evolved after my 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.030
 image is a ghost Pokemon thought well 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.540
 Nice, I wanted to test the 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.640
 possibilities and the tenth and last 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.810
 pokémon if the accounts are not wrong is 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.940
 a home to avoid 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.800
 then it may be a limiter to amputate et 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.580
 cetera because I want to give the teco 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.890
 also in the shivering itself and is 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.710
 That's it, then, of pokémons that I want 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.380
 for you contact me you 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.820
 there are two alternatives, but the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.560
 first alternative is the best first 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.300
 next face try send a 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.150
 Private message to me on youtube and 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.460
 send a message to guilherme rosa o 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.470
 my channel and do not leave a comment 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.210
 Send private direct I think 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.310
 much cooler much better to save and 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.750
 The subject is the name of the Pokémon if you 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.460
 have any of the pokémons I mentioned 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.440
 you are interested in changing the name 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.420
 past goodness, right? 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.210
 Then you send a private message to 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.190
 me and the matter or if not if you 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.770
 do not know how to send messages through 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.780
 own the own inbox right 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.340
 Can you tweet to twitter? 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.720
 Stealing pink guilherme, right? 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.940
 there through the same twitter itself 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.610
 said proudly I have horror to cross 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.440
 I'm in the mood to pass so that leaves 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.660
 Both ways for you to pass me the 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.160
 Pokémon, and as soon as I get to 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.570
 most exchanges will make a 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.550
 video showing the pokémons that the 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.950
 Did you guys play with me, huh? 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.870
 and everything else and will probably show up 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.430
 the only stat person who handed me 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.380
 opportunity to appear in the 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.390
 video also indirectly 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.890
 Other than that, I wanted to use the 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.540
 leave some warnings 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.710
 I'm already taking a look at the Pokémon 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.410
 legendary to see how I 'm going to start 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.420
 the catch is okay this week I'm fine 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.460
 busy today I worked around 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.260
 four hours in my job 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.540
 College is doing an article 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.430
 and it's really very 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.340
 complicated is a long time that demand 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.720
 so there are bgs even more maybe 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.280
 after seeing these people already starts at 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.250
 even online battles with some 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.480

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.860

 add do all the procedures 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.430
 I left it in that video so you can organize 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.320

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:36.480
