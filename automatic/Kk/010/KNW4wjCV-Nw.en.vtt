00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
app on the computer and be you just

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.540

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
it straight to your phone and if you

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.990 
it straight to your phone and if you
have<00:05:48.560> a<00:05:48.590> google<00:05:48.800> account<00:05:49.009> it's<00:05:49.490> they've<00:05:49.789> got

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
have a google account it's they've got

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.080 
have a google account it's they've got
all<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.180> details<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.650> installs

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
all the details and it installs

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.510 
all the details and it installs
automatically<00:05:53.090> it<00:05:53.360> could<00:05:53.810> not<00:05:53.840> be<00:05:54.139> easier<00:05:54.949> so

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
automatically it could not be easier so

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.100 
automatically it could not be easier so
i<00:05:55.849> think<00:05:56.150> google<00:05:57.080> have<00:05:57.380> really<00:05:59.110> sorted

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
i think google have really sorted

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.200 
i think google have really sorted
themselves<00:06:00.229> out<00:06:00.680> here<00:06:00.949> and<00:06:01.130> have<00:06:01.789> a<00:06:02.000> great

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
themselves out here and have a great

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.550 
themselves out here and have a great
android<00:06:05.210> marketplace<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.780> great<00:06:06.139> marketplace

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
android marketplace a great marketplace

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.649 
android marketplace a great marketplace
and<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:07.070> think<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.909> net<00:06:08.120> result<00:06:08.419> is<00:06:08.599> that

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
and I think the net result is that

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.459 
and I think the net result is that
people<00:06:09.199> will<00:06:09.409> discover<00:06:10.479> more<00:06:11.479> exciting<00:06:12.139> paid

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
people will discover more exciting paid

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.830 
people will discover more exciting paid
apps<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.219> they<00:06:13.610> may<00:06:13.820> well<00:06:14.030> see<00:06:14.270> an<00:06:14.479> increase

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
apps and they may well see an increase

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.760 
apps and they may well see an increase
in<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.320> amount<00:06:15.560> of<00:06:16.360> paid<00:06:17.360> for<00:06:17.810> apps<00:06:18.139> that

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
in the amount of paid for apps that

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.399 
in the amount of paid for apps that
