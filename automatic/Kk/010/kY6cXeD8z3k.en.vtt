00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.809
 to see good 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:12.940
 I bring here what the turbo 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.940
 I'm going to see this 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.360
 the fountain does not sell shoot and culture 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.519
 as more slowly a hand 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.519
 if you call Florentine 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.390
 and shoot many times 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.780
 then it is better to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.860
 let's say with the writings 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.880
 for 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.790
 for example to be able 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.790
 today shoot better all I understand 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.329
 instead 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:19.010
 this see for the songs is better 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 why 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.620
 you can shoot better 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.780
 it's so good because look 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 so this part the tour 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.160
 and so with your mind 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.750
 goes with more rafael that's pretty good 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.210
 I believe 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.720
 to see what else we have with a weapon 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.720
 example 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.200
 OK 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.440
 it's the same the need 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.689
 yes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.960
 we know that for example the best 14 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.160
 would be fine with this why 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.160
 and shoot from afar 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.840
 with the bars 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.290
 for 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.190
 then you see is much better 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.250
 I hold and shoot 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.069
 and well that's it's pretty good 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.739
 I think it will improve 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.890
 if you do not want to want to shoot from 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.890
 far 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.520
 efe 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.630
 from afar 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.630
 well and that's 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.660
 it works with this also so it keeps 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.220
 A) Yes 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.630
 here has yes 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.340
 of these you do not have to see it several 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.340
 Sometimes you do not have 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.250
 is better than this 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.550
 for example for an X 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.770
 and good a little more this 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.770
 and my command went out 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.540
 it is already for example also we have the 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:06.580
 turbo say with the materials 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.300
 this is not worth much for the truth 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.300
 heart 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.060
 same 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.840
 and good as more for nothing 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.810
 and just like this 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.400
 Keep is 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.190
 with more 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.340
 I said goodbye here, I hope you have 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.340
 liked
