the one up the hill at 170 yards and
then<00:02:15.519> here's<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.970> next<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.420> where<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> was

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
then here's the next one where I was

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.670 
then here's the next one where I was
sitting<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:18.129> only<00:02:18.489> had<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> head<00:02:19.030> shot<00:02:19.299> on<00:02:19.480> this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
sitting I only had a head shot on this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.500 
sitting I only had a head shot on this
the<00:02:20.950> cameras<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.579> little<00:02:21.790> higher<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.150> you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the cameras up a little higher but you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.839 
the cameras up a little higher but you
see<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.900> was<00:02:23.019> accurate<00:02:25.319> right<00:02:26.319> there<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
see it was accurate right there as it

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.509 
see it was accurate right there as it
rolls<00:02:28.060> even<00:02:28.360> see<00:02:28.510> what<00:02:28.689> we<00:02:28.900> missing<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.250> here

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
rolls even see what we missing and here

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:42.190 
rolls even see what we missing and here
it<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.700> again<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:31.150> slow<00:02:31.390> motion

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.210 

I'm<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.380> showing<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.709> picture<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.069> this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
I'm not showing the picture of this

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.740 
I'm not showing the picture of this
ground<00:02:44.459> scroll<00:02:44.730> because<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.569> right

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
ground scroll because you can see right

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.059 
ground scroll because you can see right
there<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.110> video<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.590> rolls<00:02:46.800> what

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
there in the video and it rolls what

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.330 
there in the video and it rolls what
happened<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:48.300> next<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.740> ground<00:02:50.040> roll

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
happened this next one this ground roll

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:59.060 
happened this next one this ground roll
was<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:51.750> wood<00:02:52.440> piles<00:02:57.620> unless<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.860> wind

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
was in some wood piles unless the wind

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.340 
was in some wood piles unless the wind
blows<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.580> or<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.270> turns<00:03:00.540> towards<00:03:01.050> me<00:03:01.170> like

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
blows it or if it turns towards me like

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:12.620 
blows it or if it turns towards me like
it's<00:03:01.530> starting<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:10.940> let's<00:03:11.940> see<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.209> again<00:03:12.390> here

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
it's starting to let's see it again here

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:31.990 
it's starting to let's see it again here
in<00:03:12.810> slow<00:03:13.680> motion

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.520 

you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.450> kind<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.720> tour<00:03:34.050> but<00:03:34.349> that's

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
you can see that kind of tour but that's

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.259 
you can see that kind of tour but that's
how<00:03:34.620> these<00:03:34.769> bullets<00:03:35.160> work<00:03:35.310> they<00:03:35.519> fragment<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
how these bullets work they fragment and

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.479 
how these bullets work they fragment and
they<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.989> basically<00:03:37.230> rip<00:03:37.890> apart<00:03:38.010> everything

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
they just basically rip apart everything

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:48.020 
they just basically rip apart everything
as<00:03:38.849> you'll<00:03:39.390> see<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.569> this<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:47.030> behind

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
as you'll see on this one here behind

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.550 
as you'll see on this one here behind
and<00:03:48.569> I'm<00:03:48.690> gonna<00:03:48.810> show<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.170> again<00:03:49.260> it's

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and I'm gonna show it to you again it's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.050 
and I'm gonna show it to you again it's
slow<00:03:49.769> motion<00:03:50.129> so<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.580> see<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
slow motion so you can see that the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.030 
slow motion so you can see that the
bullet<00:03:51.360> enters<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.930> basically<00:03:52.230> hits<00:03:52.860> him

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
bullet enters and basically hits him

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.949 
bullet enters and basically hits him
from<00:03:53.220> behind<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.580> disciplines<00:03:54.209> about<00:03:56.959> he's

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
from behind and disciplines about he's

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.220 
from behind and disciplines about he's
dead<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.910> bullet<00:04:00.150> performed<00:04:00.540> great<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.079> mean

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230

dead the bullet performed great I mean
you<00:04:01.319> can<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.650> right<00:04:01.829> there<00:04:02.040> that's<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:02.579> we

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
you can see right there that's what we

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.370 
you can see right there that's what we
strive<00:04:02.880> for<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.239> know<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.569> looks<00:04:03.780> disgusting

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
strive for I know it looks disgusting

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.110 
strive for I know it looks disgusting
but<00:04:04.560> we<00:04:04.650> want<00:04:04.860> immediate<00:04:05.190> death<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:05.970> don't

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120
