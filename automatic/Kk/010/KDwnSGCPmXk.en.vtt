 hello friend and repairman am mt technician 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.079
 thomson and today I bring another tip 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.659
 for you to show the correct procedure 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.769
 replacement of a universal lick 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.659
 mte thomson 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.359
 after removal of old mud 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.339
 vehicle the old vehicle probe 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.009
 it is good to check that the connector is 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.559
 conditions of use to reuse 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.680
 cut well on the tip of the probe and 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.120
 discard the old sensor and reuse the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.219
 vehicle connector 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.899
 we will know the mud components 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.120
 universal mt thomson 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.519
 we have here the universal probe of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.480
 four wires with the protective cover 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.210
 screw thread 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.699
 already with its grace of high temperature 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.699
 we have four thermal insulation free 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.699
 four clips for your seam 3 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.039
 clamps for securing the blade of the 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.039
 vehicle normally in the Netherlands 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.790
 the wires are two white one black and one 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.760
 gray the black is sign the gray mass and the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.040
 two white heater circularity in 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.020
 Vanda house build the different 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.670
 different colors queries our table 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.530
 colors on our website 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.780
 cuts the wires of the new lamp 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.820
 different sizes about 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.790
 10 millimeters so that the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.890
 known to do the same procedure 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.950
 avaÃ­ antique lamp whip 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:37.030
 we have here used vehicle blade 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:40.600
 cut the wires 20 to the body discards in addition 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 used and we will use the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.160
 vehicle which is still in good condition 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.590
 we will effect the amendment with the mud of 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.380
 new jet in cuts in sizes 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 different ways of capturing the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.670
 approximately 5 millimeters 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.880
 do this on the opposite connector as well 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.680
 Let's do the clip in the movie 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:28.590
 using special pliers in the clip 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 to use the wire in the clip to fit your 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.410
 stay if the company did this 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.410
 the other children also 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.269
 she we will put the technical book 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.269
 on the wires slip 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.519
 Let's put the protective cap on the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.519
 whip 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.400
 effect the amendment 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.400
 according to the colors 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.569
 Now we're going to make the wires 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:24.500
 according to the colors, ie black on the 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:27.879
 black and another white with the bank has no 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.879
 popularity in these cases 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.750
 Let's slide from the thermal free 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.750
 protecting and right in the center 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:50.190
 the advice of the left 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:56.310
 let warm to that technician to lino 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.570
 totally important never alone retracts 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.330
 the amendment 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:05.240
 the connection always use the clip 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:11.780
 provided do this on the other three wires 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.780
 deviations and the protective cover over the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.220
 Well, the probe is ready to be 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.040
 used 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.800
 the clip is a special material that 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.350
 you did not have resistance always use the 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.660
 the book never use a tape 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.880
 insulation or some other type of insulation 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.960
 this is just a training video when 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.520
 you go to work 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.740
 do not forget to use the
