units we are going to be carrying a
couple<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.460> different<00:00:11.849> ones<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.360> when<00:00:12.809> you're

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
couple of different ones and when you're

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.539 
couple of different ones and when you're
looking<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.290> them<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.799> kind<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.009> comparing

looking at them and kind of comparing
which<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.120> want<00:00:15.210> keep<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.139> mind<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
which one do I want keep in mind that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
which one do I want keep in mind that
these<00:00:17.070> smaller<00:00:17.460> ones<00:00:17.699> are<00:00:17.910> only<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> be

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
these smaller ones are only going to be

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.820 
these smaller ones are only going to be
able<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> handle<00:00:18.810> small<00:00:19.080> cameras<00:00:19.619> our

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
able to handle small cameras our

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.769 
able to handle small cameras our
smallest<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.820> only<00:00:20.970> take<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> point-and-shoot

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
smallest can only take a point-and-shoot

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.500 
smallest can only take a point-and-shoot
style<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.560> example<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.000> smaller

style for example or one of the smaller
video<00:00:25.019> cameras<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> our<00:00:27.359> larger<00:00:27.720> ones<00:00:27.900> are

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
video cameras and our larger ones are

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.419 
video cameras and our larger ones are
going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.349> able<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.590> handle<00:00:28.859> larger<00:00:29.250> things

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to be able to handle larger things

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.780 
going to be able to handle larger things
like<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.060> heavier<00:00:30.420> DSLRs<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.669> you're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
like the heavier DSLRs so when you're

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
like the heavier DSLRs so when you're
looking<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.600> stabilizer<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.440> wanna<00:00:34.680> go

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
looking at the stabilizer I wanna go

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.160 
looking at the stabilizer I wanna go
over<00:00:34.860> some<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> features<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
over some of the features of it all this

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
over some of the features of it all this
particular<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.129> you'll<00:00:38.610> notice<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.000> we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
particular one you'll notice that we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600 
particular one you'll notice that we
have<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> weight<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.920> screws<00:00:41.309> onto

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
have the weight that just screws onto

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.639 
have the weight that just screws onto
the<00:00:41.910> end<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.050> you're<00:00:43.140> packing<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the end here so when you're packing this

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
the end here so when you're packing this
up<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.010> storage<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.640> remove<00:00:45.239> those

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
up for storage you can remove those

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
up for storage you can remove those
weight<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:48.110> put<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> away<00:00:49.410> obviously<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
weight and put that away obviously this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
weight and put that away obviously this
is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> pretty<00:00:50.640> heavy<00:00:50.879> weight<00:00:51.180> needs<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
is a pretty heavy weight needs to be to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.970 
is a pretty heavy weight needs to be to
stabilize<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> heavier<00:00:53.520> camera<00:00:54.739> but<00:00:55.739> also

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
stabilize out a heavier camera but also

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
stabilize out a heavier camera but also
you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.460> adjust<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.750> weight<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you can adjust where this weight is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
you can adjust where this weight is
positioned<00:00:58.859> by<00:00:59.460> adjusting<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.180> front<00:01:00.539> knob

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
positioned by adjusting this front knob

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
positioned by adjusting this front knob
turning<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.039> direction<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.699> slowly

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
turning it one direction will slowly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
turning it one direction will slowly
bring<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.449> downwards<00:01:04.229> turning<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> other

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
bring it downwards turning it the other

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760 
bring it downwards turning it the other
way<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.519> slowly<00:01:05.760> bring<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> back<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.380> reason

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
way will slowly bring it back the reason

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
way will slowly bring it back the reason
for<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.250> course<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.240> weight<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
for that of course is as your weight is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.020 
for that of course is as your weight is
kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> pushed<00:01:10.619> forward<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> camera<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
kind of pushed forward with the camera a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
kind of pushed forward with the camera a
larger<00:01:12.689> lens<00:01:12.900> obviously<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.040> need<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
larger lens obviously you need the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
larger lens obviously you need the
counterweight<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.630> basically

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
counterweight to it which is basically

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
counterweight to it which is basically
what<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.350> serves<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.890> further<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:18.150> because

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
what this serves as further back because

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.749 
what this serves as further back because
this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.409> free<00:01:20.070> swinging<00:01:20.430> when

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
this is going to be free swinging when

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
this is going to be free swinging when
you<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.360> unit<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.840> propped<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.520> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you have the unit you know propped up so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
you have the unit you know propped up so
obviously<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.450> needs<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.810> able<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.080> counter

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
obviously it needs to be able to counter

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
obviously it needs to be able to counter
with<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> weight<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.430> wherever<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:27.060> weight

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with the weight so wherever your weight

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
with the weight so wherever your weight
is<00:01:27.780> heaviest<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> unit<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> where<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
is heaviest on the unit is where this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.080 
is heaviest on the unit is where this
needs<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.150> opposite<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.880> mind

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
needs to be opposite up so that in mind

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.760 
needs to be opposite up so that in mind
that's<00:01:33.270> how<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.720> adjust<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.530> arm

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that's how you would adjust the arm

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.730 
that's how you would adjust the arm
section<00:01:35.430> when<00:01:36.060> we're<00:01:36.210> looking<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.869> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
section when we're looking at this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
section when we're looking at this
section<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> couple<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
section here would you have a couple of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
section here would you have a couple of
things<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> consider<00:01:40.430> obviously<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> handle

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
things to consider obviously the handle

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789 
things to consider obviously the handle
is<00:01:42.060> free<00:01:42.360> motion<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.960> needs<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
is free motion it needs to be so that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.920 
is free motion it needs to be so that
your<00:01:44.189> whole<00:01:44.970> unit<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> adjust

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
your whole unit can kind of adjust

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.310 
your whole unit can kind of adjust
around<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:47.009> grip<00:01:47.340> back<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.810> also<00:01:48.960> have

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
around your grip back here we also have

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
adjust your center of balance you also

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.950 
adjust your center of balance you also
have<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.340> knob<00:01:59.610> right<00:01:59.880> here<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.810> going

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
have this knob right here which is going

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
have this knob right here which is going
to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.500> important<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
to be really important because that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
to be really important because that
releases<00:02:03.780> your<00:02:04.020> top<00:02:04.290> plate<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
releases your top plate so you have that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.059 
releases your top plate so you have that
top<00:02:06.090> plate<00:02:06.360> screwed<00:02:06.780> into<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.229> camera<00:02:07.469> and

the way at the back and once you have

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.890 
the way at the back and once you have
that<00:02:23.010> plate<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.550> there's<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:24.720> lip

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that plate on there's just a little lip

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.100 
that plate on there's just a little lip
at<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> front<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.620> slides<00:02:26.160> underneath<00:02:27.110> this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
at the front it slides underneath this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.140 
at the front it slides underneath this
back<00:02:28.530> section<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.900> going<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> prop

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
back section here is just going to prop

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.870 
back section here is just going to prop
onto<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> back<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:35.370> you'll<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.850> course

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
onto the back and then you'll of course

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.540 
onto the back and then you'll of course
take<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.750> screw<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.650> screw<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.100> into<00:02:38.280> this

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
take the screw and screw it into this

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.060 
take the screw and screw it into this
back<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:41.450> that'll<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.770> your<00:02:43.770> plate

little bubble level that can help you

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.280 
little bubble level that can help you
keep<00:02:51.120> track<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.720> you're<00:02:51.900> making<00:02:52.080> your

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
keep track as you're making your

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.980 
keep track as you're making your
adjustments<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.490> where<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.030> want<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
adjustments to see where you want the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.620 
adjustments to see where you want the
weight<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.740> be<00:02:55.920> at<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.310> kind<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.150> kind<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.480> help

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
weight to be at and kind of kind of help

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.410 
weight to be at and kind of kind of help
you<00:02:57.720> keep<00:02:57.959> track<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:59.459> obviously<00:02:59.700> once

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you keep track so then obviously once

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.930 
you keep track so then obviously once
you're<00:03:00.690> done<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:02.130> going<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:02.580> up<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
you're done and it's going to go up and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.090 
you're done and it's going to go up and
be<00:03:03.120> pretty<00:03:03.360> much<00:03:03.570> stabilized<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.860> you're

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
be pretty much stabilized so you're

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.320 
be pretty much stabilized so you're
going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.400> able<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:05.910> your<00:03:06.030> free

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
going to be able to do in your free

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.420 
going to be able to do in your free
motion<00:03:06.600> with<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.290> unit<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.920> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
motion with the unit and that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.010 
motion with the unit and that
counterweight<00:03:09.060> will<00:03:09.540> kind<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.840> add<00:03:09.990> to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
counterweight will kind of add to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.320 
counterweight will kind of add to
stabilize<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.130> motion<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.790> help<00:03:11.970> keep<00:03:12.150> it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
stabilize that motion and help keep it

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.840 
stabilize that motion and help keep it
smooth<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.590> these<00:03:13.709> stabilizing<00:03:14.400> units<00:03:14.489> have

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
smooth so these stabilizing units have

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.820 
smooth so these stabilizing units have
become<00:03:15.090> pretty<00:03:15.300> popular<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.930> video<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.440> recent

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
become pretty popular in video in recent

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.650 
become pretty popular in video in recent
years<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.850> will<00:03:18.060> allow<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.510> have

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
years and this will allow you to have

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.210 
years and this will allow you to have
hand<00:03:18.959> free<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.620> doing<00:03:19.920> focus<00:03:20.370> or<00:03:21.150> zoom<00:03:21.690> or<00:03:22.220> you

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
hand free for doing focus or zoom or you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.860 
hand free for doing focus or zoom or you
know<00:03:23.310> whatever<00:03:23.550> else<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.120> quit<00:03:24.420> need<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.750> your

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
know whatever else you quit need to your

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.370 
know whatever else you quit need to your
second<00:03:25.260> hand<00:03:25.500> foreign<00:03:25.830> video<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
second hand foreign video so that is the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.380 
second hand foreign video so that is the
basics<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.920> our<00:03:29.040> stabilizer<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.239> other

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
basics of our stabilizer the other

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.000 
basics of our stabilizer the other
stabilizers<00:03:31.110> are<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> work<00:03:31.709> basically

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
stabilizers are going to work basically

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.060 
stabilizers are going to work basically
the<00:03:32.459> same<00:03:32.670> way<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.630> why<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.470> mentioned<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
the same way so why you mentioned the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.250 
the same way so why you mentioned the
biggest<00:03:35.459> difference<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.970> what<00:03:36.300> size<00:03:36.630> camera
