00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello to all , what a case I'm eating ho 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.290
 decided to make a variation of the other 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.040
 sandwich with peanut butter 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.759
 the jam or this morning 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.119
 breakfast with a magic butter sandwich 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.480
 peanut and nutella 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.150
 I want to feel like you have not seen 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.660
 video where they eat it I have not seen 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.790
 add this recipe or destroyed everything 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.969
 since there is this last slice though 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 half the culasso some must-size 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:48.410
 very well this knife tells me but 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.410
 this bread disintegrates brings month 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.210
 let's see if mine was a good idea 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.829
 or scerni otherwise not in the pasta a little 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.540
 mouth has still put off discover 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:08.070
 outside we know nothing a little cramped together 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 this year probably because of the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 Italian taste but I prefer this 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.400
 with nutella and peanut butter than anything else 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.600
 it's good but I can't explain it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.119
 it almost seems that they are there no one knows 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.770
 put a taste all creamy and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.869
 sweet salty good name is a little 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.229
 the dough I use that is team step all over 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.790
 mouth, however, if you do not eat so not 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.850
 listen there seems to be only one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 what if instead you concentrate you succeeded 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.790
 to feel the part in the difficult 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 numerous was a pure part of giving you but yes 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.630
 could risk quietly 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.060
 even try it at home I'll make you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.990
 become obese become o 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.360
 needs like me but where does someone go 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.090

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.729
 because it's not there now it's gone to tax 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.050

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.760
