00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and what I mean by that is that i didn't

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
and what I mean by that is that i didn't
use<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.520> guns<00:00:56.789> i<00:00:57.059> didn't<00:00:57.239> get<00:00:57.329> any<00:00:57.480> gun<00:00:57.719> kills

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
use my guns i didn't get any gun kills

use my guns i didn't get any gun kills
all<00:00:58.260> i<00:00:58.289> did<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.500> run<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.309> some

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
all i did was run around and I some

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.950 
all i did was run around and I some
people<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.660> what<00:01:00.840> really

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
people and I think that's what really

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
people and I think that's what really
makes<00:01:01.200> this<00:01:01.350> gameplay<00:01:01.590> fun<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> watch<00:01:02.640> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
makes this gameplay fun to watch it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.160 
makes this gameplay fun to watch it
because<00:01:02.969> there's<00:01:03.690> nothing<00:01:03.989> better<00:01:04.080> than

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
because there's nothing better than

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
because there's nothing better than
running<00:01:04.500> around<00:01:04.830> pretending<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.430> only<00:01:05.580> use

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
running around pretending to be only use

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.400 
running around pretending to be only use
me<00:01:05.880> playing<00:01:06.119> stabbing<00:01:06.690> some<00:01:06.869> people<00:01:07.200> because

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
me playing stabbing some people because

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.290 
me playing stabbing some people because
I<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.430> always<00:01:08.670> entertaining<00:01:08.789> and

play again I could see myself getting
quite<00:04:29.940> angry<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.599> agitated<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.680> wouldn't

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
quite angry and agitated that I wouldn't

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.260
