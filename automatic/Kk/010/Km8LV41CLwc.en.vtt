00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.470
 a good entry level in the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.480
 aachener albert vahle hall had to 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.059
 Beginning of the year riders and horses the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.160
 possibility of a course under real 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.260
 tournament conditions 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.840
 like a normal tournament they are 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.910
 Rider dressed in white and jacket and 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.780
 the horses according to the guidelines 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.780

 there are no individual examinations in advance 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 can the riders for one 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.470
 sign up for a certain height 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 the course and the line guides 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.840
 stay the same only the height 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.430
 is increased from 90 cm to 1 meter 30 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 every rider strives for the given 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.530
 parcours faultless and in a good 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.360
 something should not take time 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
 There is no other way than one 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 testing the possibility after the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.360
 next start 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.160
 to deny the course again 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 Although the time and the errors 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.880
 of each state 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.259
 there is a prize giving ceremony on one 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.259
 exercise tournament however not 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.979
 In addition to the tournament beginners use too 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 experienced riders the possibility of their 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.860
 Horses on the upcoming season 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.049
 prepare 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.179
 especially young horses can do so 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.899
 the atmosphere of a tournament 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.479
 become 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.090
 the advantages of an exercise tournament are 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.220
 the lower pressure drives and rider the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.289
 several times a course to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.630
 overcome and experience for 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.579
 collected important upcoming exams 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.630
 can be 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.969
 otherwise everything is really like 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.459
 tournament so it's just that way 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.509
 you can choose the height that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.569
 you do not get into any one 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.040
 must hold performance class in the reason 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.420
 taken and the advantage is to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.700
 for example, if it did not work out 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.709
 then we have another round 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.209
 You can just ride to the registration office 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.519
 give I must say once again a round 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.260
 ride which also I is beneficial 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.200
 can also go with the train later 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.090
 and it's a bit more of me in the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.140
 check it yourself, of course 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 on the big advantage 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.790
 Unlike apple exams become exercise 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.620
 tournaments are not always advertised 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 a look on the internet or the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.700
 Above all, there can be exchange with the rider 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.920
 but help and for yourself and his 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.100
 a suitable event for the horse 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.100
 Find
