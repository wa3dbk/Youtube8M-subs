all<00:00:04.760> right<00:00:04.910> everyone<00:00:05.210> today<00:00:05.630> we<00:00:05.810> will<00:00:05.930> be

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
all right everyone today we will be

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.060 
all right everyone today we will be
testing<00:00:06.380> the<00:00:06.859> faraday<00:00:07.819> tu-95<00:00:08.780> for<00:00:09.230> speaker

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
testing the faraday tu-95 for speaker

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.779 
testing the faraday tu-95 for speaker
strobe<00:00:10.719> it<00:00:11.719> does<00:00:12.020> in<00:00:12.350> fact<00:00:12.379> say<00:00:12.830> Faraday<00:00:13.639> on

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
strobe it does in fact say Faraday on

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.910 
strobe it does in fact say Faraday on
the<00:00:13.879> back<00:00:14.090> I<00:00:15.520> don't<00:00:16.520> know<00:00:17.000> if<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:17.270> could<00:00:17.920> see

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
the back I don't know if you could see

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.110 
the back I don't know if you could see
it<00:00:19.150> uh<00:00:21.400> there<00:00:22.400> there<00:00:22.760> we<00:00:22.850> go

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
it uh there there we go

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.000 
it uh there there we go
Faraday<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:24.730> guess<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:25.940> was<00:00:26.060> uh<00:00:26.680> this<00:00:27.680> is<00:00:27.890> an

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
Faraday I guess it was uh this is an

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.910 
Faraday I guess it was uh this is an
early<00:00:28.250> model<00:00:28.520> where<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:29.060> was<00:00:29.500> still<00:00:30.500> Faraday

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
early model where it was still Faraday

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.310 
early model where it was still Faraday
or<00:00:31.070> something<00:00:31.369> like<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:33.010> but<00:00:34.010> whatever<00:00:35.320> it

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
or something like that but whatever it

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.050 
or something like that but whatever it
was<00:00:36.380> no<00:00:37.300> rebranded<00:00:38.300> as<00:00:38.450> seen<00:00:38.720> ins<00:00:38.900> later<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:40.060> so

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
was no rebranded as seen ins later on so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.150 
was no rebranded as seen ins later on so
I<00:00:41.090> think<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:41.510> was<00:00:41.720> originally<00:00:42.260> made<00:00:43.100> by

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
I think this was originally made by

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.799 
I think this was originally made by
Faraday<00:00:43.790> hence<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.780> alarm<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.550> have<00:00:46.550> no<00:00:47.510> idea

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
Faraday hence the alarm I have no idea

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.110 
Faraday hence the alarm I have no idea
what<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.050> actual<00:00:48.260> model<00:00:49.070> model<00:00:49.670> number<00:00:49.970> is

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
what the actual model model number is

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.049 
what the actual model model number is
that<00:00:50.390> that's<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:51.399> that's<00:00:52.399> on<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.120> back<00:00:55.059> well

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
that that's it that's on the back well

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.150 
that that's it that's on the back well
without<00:00:56.809> further<00:00:56.870> ado<00:00:57.440> let's<00:00:57.739> get<00:00:57.950> this

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
without further ado let's get this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.380 
without further ado let's get this
strobe<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:58.730> go<00:00:59.059> three<00:00:59.899> two<00:01:00.649> one<00:01:01.399> I<00:01:04.239> think<00:01:05.239> this

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
strobe but go three two one I think this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.629 
strobe but go three two one I think this
is<00:01:05.540> like<00:01:05.689> fifteen<00:01:06.500> Candela<00:01:07.130> or<00:01:07.340> something

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:07.639 
is like fifteen Candela or something

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:15.459 
is like fifteen Candela or something
like<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:07.789> I<00:01:08.590> don't<00:01:09.590> know<00:01:14.079> let's<00:01:15.079> turn<00:01:15.350> off

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
like that I don't know let's turn off

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:32.230 
like that I don't know let's turn off
the<00:01:15.619> lights<00:01:15.859> here<00:01:20.380> yeah<00:01:21.380> that's<00:01:21.529> pretty<00:01:21.740> good

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.620 

let's<00:01:33.240> cut<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> power<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.479> for

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
let's cut the power and that's it for

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.710 
let's cut the power and that's it for
now<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.729> activate<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.330> with<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> pull

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
now and to activate it with the pull

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.190 
now and to activate it with the pull
station<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.040> using<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.990> in<00:01:42.990> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
station we will be using the in this

I don't know but in this case it's going

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.380 
I don't know but in this case it's going
to<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.130> typical<00:01:59.340> Siemens<00:02:00.090> voice

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390

have the Siemens voice evac message but
what's<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.050> end<00:02:07.289> of<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.530> right<00:02:07.800> now<00:02:07.850> when<00:02:08.850> we

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
what's the end of that right now when we

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729 
what's the end of that right now when we
have<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> pull<00:02:09.509> station<00:02:09.899> demo<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.320> do<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
have the pull station demo to do so

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:20.390 
have the pull station demo to do so
let's<00:02:11.580> activate<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:19.800> see<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> strobe

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
let's activate it you can see the strobe

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.750 
let's activate it you can see the strobe
flashing<00:02:20.970> away<00:02:22.100> away<00:02:23.120> away
