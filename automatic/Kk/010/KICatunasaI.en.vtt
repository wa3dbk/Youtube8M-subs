00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
one thing we won't be using the high E

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950 
one thing we won't be using the high E
and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> low<00:00:35.550> E<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> RPG<00:00:36.540> pattern

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and the low E in this RPG pattern

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.110 
and the low E in this RPG pattern
completely<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:38.129> we'll<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.460> using<00:00:38.640> only<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
completely and we'll be using only the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.680 
completely and we'll be using only the
rest<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> middle<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.040> strings<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.450> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
rest of the middle for strings so this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.350 
rest of the middle for strings so this
pattern<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.860> hit<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> strings<00:00:44.899> d<00:00:45.899> g<00:00:46.379> VG<00:00:46.860> d<00:00:47.610> gb

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pattern and hit the strings d g VG d gb

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
pattern and hit the strings d g VG d gb
g<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.190> minor<00:00:54.260> now<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:57.170> your<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.739> two

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
g then a minor now with your these two

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
g then a minor now with your these two
fingers<00:00:59.100> block<00:00:59.940> 3rd<00:01:00.930> fret<00:01:01.440> string<00:01:02.430> g<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> d

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
fingers block 3rd fret string g and d

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.510 
fingers block 3rd fret string g and d
and<00:01:04.309> with<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> ring<00:01:06.119> finger<00:01:07.250> spread<00:01:08.250> 5<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.880> string

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.010 

so<00:01:15.140> KD<00:01:16.159> GT

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
so KD GT

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.470 
so KD GT
then<00:01:20.020> again<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:22.180> string<00:01:23.110> D<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.610> thread

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
then again your string D and a thread

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:35.440 
then again your string D and a thread
number<00:01:25.660> two<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.410> three<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:28.750> pattern

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.980 

so

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:55.469 

this<00:01:43.990> pattern<00:01:47.939> okay<00:01:48.939> after<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:54.179> so<00:01:55.179> this

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
this pattern okay after that so this

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.419 
this pattern okay after that so this
would<00:01:55.689> be<00:01:55.719> played<00:01:56.049> over<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:56.890> over<00:01:57.100> again
