00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 - In fact somehow judas him 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.830
 question if you are told that it is such if I 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.200
 I will not do this what if I do not 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.490
 I will acknowledge that this is where 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 mission because it's not really what 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 I look for him and he says he goes with your 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 duty in the background and that things happen 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.369
 as they are written then some 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.680
 way it's like you do not do it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.140
 Exactly invites you to say let's follow the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 plan as it was prefixed good is what 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 that we are in the book of goods and the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.230
 The first book of the pentateuch is called 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.070
 because they are the five main books 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.380
 where somehow it reinforces all 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 the Jewish religion and that then when 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.850
 the new testament is added there already 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 the Jews are left out of that belief 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.300
 we find what is nowadays called 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.309
 bible what we had discussed in a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 start was that the bible that you 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.059
 you have in your house that while you have to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.930
 understand these many versions there are 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.670
 different types of translations is a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 book that was edited approximately in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 the year 300 when the Christians left 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.320
 of being persecuted and that he chose him 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.960
 man 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.280
 unfortunately look no what I say no 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.619
 it was with bad intention he was chosen with 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.590
 the heart and the most open mind in the 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.920
 shelves anyway 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.690
 finally you who is a student of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.360
 christianity you who have it 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 rooted as your family faith header 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.259
 of base I invite you to let's say to study 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.119
 the other books that were not included 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.380
 and that at some point they belonged to 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.049
 all the large amount of information 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.780
 regarding the birth of man 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.399
 creation of heaven and earth and all 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 the prophets and apostles live for having 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.920
 raised with the origin of no and yes that 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.920
 it's tremendous interest but it's not one of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.530
 the sons of Matusalem true here the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.470
 thing gets complicated because the bible of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 a categorical jump of the birth adam 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.940
 and eva 'with his children certain cain and abel 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.069
 then it started on set and all the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.710
 others and between that appears this man 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.350
 who is married to a woman 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.030
 and they did not have offspring they were married 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.610
 even more they had not specified their 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.130
 marriage or they had not played the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.080
 mom's dad as well said 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.080
 then suddenly one of the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 angels that not certain that he is the father of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 one of them says messenger not 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.760
 angels are even angels 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.830
 fallen are the angels that that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.239
 they were left on the ground not that they are going 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.010
 and coming to the player but he 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.950
 they were between us and that some 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.569
 they say they would also be the originators 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.280
 of goliat that we are going to be talking about 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.760
 of that then I want you to go tell you 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.010
 that is not happy with the creation and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.530
 that is in the traditional bible with 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.000
 all the way that man race 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.550
 human has followed until this 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.440
 Then God decides to exterminate 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.650
 with all of it through a flood 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.080
 but for that you need a guide I need 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.690
 a reformer needs a human 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.880
 rebuilt in perfection to guide 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.290
 to the new human race that are the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.850
 survivors that are going to be left after 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.340
 of this universal flood then 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.190
 Matron's wife ends up staying 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.780
 pregnant without him having touched 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.580
 finally this man are left in full 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.010
 mistrust and says whatever you got 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.740
 the whole question and you go where the father of 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.330
 him and tell him look please check the and 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.540
 tell me if I really liked who I did not like 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.190
 the horns says I can attest if well 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 I can not explain what happened 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.290
 if they come or tell us they are the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.210
 angels messengers who left her 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.050
 conceive those who learned it in the 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.040
 bottom this woman nothing is pregnant and 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.890
 let's say it is still in virginal state 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.570
 he has a son, they put him noah and when he 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.730
 man grows with all his son and his 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.770
 offspring and they say send 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.940
 build an ark with such 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.650
 characteristics in fact 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.230
 characteristics is in the bible be it 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.750
 so of such size with such properties 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.790
 that you have to cover it with pitch on the outside 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.590
 so that the end does not pass the eyes for the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.860
 water there is your hand as well as the ark 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.990
 of the alliance 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.840
 on earth an exact deluge 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.640
 with you I will make my alliance built a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.170
 Ark and put her to your family and one 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.370
 couple of animals of each species 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.500
 excellent according to an interpretation 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.270
 further in addition nine hundred steps 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.880
 twenty years 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.310
 warning his contemporaries of 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.050
 danger that threatened them did not 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.570
 they did listen to you hear forgiveness a 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.190
 parenthesis that had to do with 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.050
 some way the loss of identity 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.120
 that existed in the town or in that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.220
 then they had fallen too much and in 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.170
 exactly there were hanging from the face 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.910
 They had forgotten God as Felipe says 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.820
 and somehow they are already living 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.310
 let 's start it in excess and 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.640
 let's say they had put the funny thing of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.080
 a crazy life then when it says 120 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.490
 years warning you have to understand that 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.490
 without going any further, only Methuselah 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.930
 900 years and clarified the people lived that 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.120
 amount abraham is said to have lived a 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.360
 number of similar years we know that 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 no one 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.539
 even the saying and it stays forever 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.769
 it's like less
