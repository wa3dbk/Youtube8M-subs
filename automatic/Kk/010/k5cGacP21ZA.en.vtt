00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi air you look at a new one again 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.370
 video on the youtube channel of japanese 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 stab shop.nl 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 tonight a very nice video or you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.160
 because I am going new and cow in kit 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.190
 with this kit you can namely 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.220
 I made pizza and also saw a drink as well 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.900
 Earth cookies and super fun and the fun 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.580
 this kit is that you can mine too 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.240
 use drum for this and I think so 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 always fun 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.930
 I already have the hamburger once 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 kit made and this kit went too 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.199
 partially in the microwave and found that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.420
 I really liked it is now one again 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.399
 an extra step and for this kit we have 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.559
 so also the microwave needed for a moment 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.390
 but a few seconds I thought and beside 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.790
 we have this kit and the microwave 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.730
 actually as always a pair of scissors 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.469
 needed and a bowl of water I am whole 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 very curious how this will be but also 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 however curious that taste and medina are 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 to watch no the video what to it 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.860
 At the end I will also have a taste and leave it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 you know 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.329
 yeah how it tastes well this is the whole one 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 nice cheerful outside and then this 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.840
 you can see that you sign for this 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.789
 need a microwave 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 and here the back with a lot 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.670
 instructions 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 we are going to open it for a moment and then comes 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 another new bag out and that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.460
 cut weave open and then one comes 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.330
 whole bowl with all small ones 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.360
 bags these bags are already in it and one 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.280
 cup and a life and the bowl 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.020
 where we mix everything we go all 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 just put away the bags and the goat 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.130
 all cut out and then we go 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 start making the potato cookies 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 and you grab a bowl with it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.700
 a faces and the large mixing bowl and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 the yellow bag and the hour is two 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.159
 do cups of water 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.159
 and we will stir this well 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.520
 and once it is good by birth 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.290
 knead well and if it completely 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.090
 is dressed then you can well busy 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.970
 the container and then it can be for 40 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.470
 in seconds at 500 watts in the microwave and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.450
 when you come out its simply hard 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.970
 and then tap out for a moment 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.070
 and then you see the faces in the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.320
 potato cookies and I have them 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.000
 briefly broken with the spoon and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 these now go sideways again as we go 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.520
 making pizza 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.860
 for that we take the big orange 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.250
 bag and here are four scoops with 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.250
 water 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.470
 and this we go again very well 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.000
 stirring and this lasted well for a while 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.890
 by stirring and at a given moment 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.450
 it really is a dough ball 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.489
 and this one also not quite for a while 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.690
 knead your hands and then divide 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.640
 about two balls and what we are going now 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.410
 do is really make a pizza mold and 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.420
 you will do that with both balls 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.100
 and if you have done that, they will be absorbed 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.100
 the plate with the potato cookies 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.330
 now we are going to make cheese and take it from it 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.459
 we the green bag and a cup with 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.110
 water and once it's good 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.459
 stirred then you notice that the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.709
 substance really a bit unpleasant 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.420
 mozzarella balls and then we go 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.430
 just put it aside and I have it on 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.380
 put the bag 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.260
 then the tomato sauce for that 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.260
 bars and two cups with water 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.769
 and this will stir well until we 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.760
 really a bit smooth and beautiful 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.769
 now we have sauce and we will make meat 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.900
 we have to reuse this bag from there 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.090
 that I cut a really good line 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.620
 and here are also two cups with 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.989
 Stir the water well 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.030
 but this becomes a bit slurdy 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.790
 so don't panic it becomes one 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.959
 bit and then we go back into the slurry 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.959
 put the bag back 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.299
 and then the substance lasts one more 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.459
 little deeper in the bag and wife come 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.220
 double and on the fauw lines for a while 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.840
 we will also leave this body for a while 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.030
 now we grab the pizzas and all of them 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.379
 ingredients that blue bag you need him 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.239
 just cut open but the hooves 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.159
 nothing to do with it I think see it 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.959
 a little ready-made big one 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.989
 and we will start with the pizzas 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.730
 smear with the tomato sauce and 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.159
 then we go over the cheese 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.040
 distributor and yes I speak a bit 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.069
 pieces off so we kind of yes 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.170
 packs of cheese and and now we pack 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.510
 add the meat and go neeltje a little 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.549
 cut the dot off well the corner 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.379
 and as you see now, a little bit comes 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.780
 a weird kind 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.790
 yes meat behind something from that it has to 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.409
 proposals and with it 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.900
 spoon every time I go small 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.859
 chop off pieces and place on the pizza 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.780
 and so I do with the pieces and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.130
 now we go a piece would be your vegetables 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.830
 I just put it on it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.900
 vegetables and well if I pick it up slowly 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.720
 we put the vegetables and the potato cookies there 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.389
 now and then they go in the microwave and they 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.830
 are from 50 seconds to 500 watts in the 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.150
 been a microwave 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.789
 and well you just prevent them that way 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.180
 melted out and now just the drink 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.340
 to make 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.440
 then you grab the spoonful of water you put there 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.630
 an inch of water and you throw it 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.630
 purple bag and you see it goes 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.400
 really very nice bubbling and yes then 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.550
 stir a little and then be
