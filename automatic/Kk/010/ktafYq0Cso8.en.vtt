00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.900
 this good first are not more things 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.780
 because it's illegal because it says a wildlife 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 wild and therefore they are 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.990
 captured in the wild for later 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.710
 sell it as to defend them 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.270
 illegally on the roads and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 they usually have to kill the mother 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.600
 to be able to take away the baby and sell the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.940
 breed this second as the monkeys are not 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.350
 pets animals that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 can have as pets are the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.540
 domestic animals and so they weigh 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.450
 what people think they really do not 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.950
 can tame how they are primates 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.950
 The same as us 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 They share with us several 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.739
 diseases then we the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 we can infect them and they 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.320
 we transmit diseases of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.030
 many types behind the parasites that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.700
 they have the can members can 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.170
 Paste the others can transmit 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.550
 Skin diseases hate 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 they can also be carriers of 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.130
 the rage of yellow fever of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.550
 tuberculosis are also several 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.550
 diseases 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.680
 the people most likely to acquire 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.720
 these illnesses 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.300
 good people with prone would be 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.340
 children the elderly and people 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.020
 that by some special conditions 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.430
 are none suppressed for example 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.790
 the people who are under treatment 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.800
 of chemotherapy afterwards are the most 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.360
 prone to suffer from teaching 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.100
 particularly anyone who is in 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.790
 direct contact with the animal is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.800
 could infect although this kind of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.410
 animal is aggressive with beings 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.990
 humans 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.080
 depending on the species but so 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 general all wild animals 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.320
 when they are young, that's why 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 they sell the young with him when they are young 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 and they are meek but when they get to 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 this adult stage and go to the layer of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.780
 sexual maturity almost always turn 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 aggressive and that's when many 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.649
 people see that they can not 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.110
 handle they realize that by being 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.209
 aggressive can not be a pet and what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 they end up abandoning by donating to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.819
 zoo and for the monkey what are the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.450
 risks of being outside their habitat 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.459
 although notice what when an animal 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.269
 wild is outside its habitat 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.219
 natural suffering from stress by not having the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.799
 space you need by not having the 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.769
 Proper nutrition begins to suffer 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.150
 stress and you can get sick though almost 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.760
 all the animals that are in 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.099
 captivity wild animals or the ones 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 that they experience problems are things 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.859
 being in captivity they get sick and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.200
 because in general they live less for example 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.599
 a monkey in good conditions can 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.239
 live up to 20 25 years but in 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.019
 captivity you see that they live 5 when 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.980
 are we say in a house had 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.840
 kept as pets under 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.109
 inadequate conditions feeding 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.269
 adequate live very little 58 years 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.760
 many people die because of problems of 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.919
 management and what recommendation would you give to 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.230
 the people who currently have a 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:22.090
 monkey as a pet at home 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.090
 what else and good the first one 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.650
 is try to seek veterinary advice 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.510
 specialized so they know how 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.459
 keep 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.040
 to this animal in the best conditions 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.849
 possible and therefore in case of not being able 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.860
 give those conditions to this animal to 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.900
 an institution that can do this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.989
 institution can be that really 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.000
 still in maracaibo there is no no 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.640
 institutions or shelters that can 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.670
 shelter those animals but in the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.260
 zoo because they receive the animals 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.599
 when they deliver them as 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.849
 donation is not the duty to be rather in 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.349
 the zoo are good in many 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.659
 animals precisely for the same reason 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.190
 because the year people when they already give 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.739
 realize that you can not keep 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.569
 will leave there but at least in the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.230
 been zulia for the moments until 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.940
 now 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.940
 the only institution that receives it
