the<00:00:06.450> crisscross<00:00:06.899> stitch<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> really<00:00:07.859> pretty

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the crisscross stitch is a really pretty

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.180 
the crisscross stitch is a really pretty
stitch<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.940> has<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.510> weave<00:00:09.929> patterns<00:00:10.590> will

stitch that has to weave patterns will

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.249 
stitch that has to weave patterns will
just<00:00:11.429> keep<00:00:11.610> alternating<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.960> weave

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
just keep alternating the to weave

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.709 
just keep alternating the to weave

effect<00:00:16.250> your<00:00:17.250> criss<00:00:17.490> cross<00:00:17.760> stitch<00:00:18.090> consists

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
effect your criss cross stitch consists

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
effect your criss cross stitch consists
of<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.140> weave<00:00:19.500> patterns<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.580> first<00:00:20.880> one

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
of two weave patterns the first one

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.529 
of two weave patterns the first one
starts<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.529> first<00:00:23.430> needle<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:24.000> your

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
starts off on the first needle on your

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.370 
starts off on the first needle on your
backboard

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
backboard

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.400 
backboard
down<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> fourth<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.539> three<00:00:27.960> four

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
down to the fourth one two three four

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
down to the fourth one two three four
then<00:00:29.130> you're<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> weave<00:00:29.970> back<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
then you're just going to weave back and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.569 
then you're just going to weave back and
forth<00:00:30.840> across<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.230> board<00:00:31.679> skipping<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
forth across your board skipping a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.650 
forth across your board skipping a
needle<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.719> we're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.079> every<00:00:34.500> other<00:00:34.680> pin

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
needle so we're going every other pin

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.400 
needle so we're going every other pin
all<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> angle<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.410> then

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
all the way down at that angle and then

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.600 
all the way down at that angle and then
when<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> end<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
when we get to the end we're going to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
when we get to the end we're going to
simply<00:00:41.879> take<00:00:41.910> our<00:00:42.239> yarn<00:00:42.450> straight<00:00:42.809> across<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
simply take our yarn straight across the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
simply take our yarn straight across the
board<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.820> we're<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> turn<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
board and then we're going to turn the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.190 
board and then we're going to turn the
board<00:00:45.690> around<00:00:47.510> now<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> return

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
board around now we're going to return

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
board around now we're going to return
by<00:00:49.680> picking<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> needles<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.059> we

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
by picking up the needles that we

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.729 
by picking up the needles that we
skipped<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.739> our<00:00:52.890> pins<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.550> two

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
skipped so that all of our pins have two

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.330 
skipped so that all of our pins have two
loops<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.219> you'll<00:00:57.090> notice<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
loops on them you'll notice that at the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
loops on them you'll notice that at the
ends<00:00:59.789> both<00:01:00.030> ends<00:01:00.329> you're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> have

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
ends both ends you're going to have

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.479 
ends both ends you're going to have
consecutive<00:01:01.859> weaving<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:04.369> then<00:01:05.369> you'll

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
consecutive weaving and then you'll

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.730 
consecutive weaving and then you'll
always<00:01:05.729> end<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.659> pin<00:01:06.930> directly<00:01:07.560> across

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
always end on the pin directly across

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.850 
always end on the pin directly across
from<00:01:08.010> where<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> started<00:01:09.439> now<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.650> ready

consists of two weave patterns it might
be<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.210> little<00:04:39.450> concern<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.350> you're<00:04:40.650> going<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
be a little concern that you're going to

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.970 
be a little concern that you're going to
set<00:04:41.070> your<00:04:41.220> weaving<00:04:41.460> down<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:42.440> not<00:04:43.440> be<00:04:43.620> able<00:04:43.800> to

set your weaving down and not be able to

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.270 
set your weaving down and not be able to
remember<00:04:44.490> which<00:04:45.240> road<00:04:45.570> did<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.960> do<00:04:46.020> last<00:04:46.280> so

remember which road did I do last so

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.700 
remember which road did I do last so
here's<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.790> little<00:04:48.150> hint<00:04:48.330> for<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.630> look<00:04:49.590> at

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
here's a little hint for you look at

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.170 
here's a little hint for you look at
your<00:04:49.890> weave<00:04:50.040> pattern<00:04:50.490> when<00:04:50.669> you<00:04:50.760> come<00:04:51.000> back

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
your weave pattern when you come back

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.620 
your weave pattern when you come back
you<00:04:52.020> will<00:04:52.050> see<00:04:52.230> how<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.580> loop<00:04:53.850> at<00:04:54.120> your<00:04:54.390> first

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
you will see how the loop at your first

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.170 
you will see how the loop at your first
one<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.560> can<00:04:55.800> kind<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.130> follow<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.610> down<00:04:56.850> over

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
one you can kind of follow it down over

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.550 
one you can kind of follow it down over
here<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.930> third<00:04:58.729> this<00:04:59.729> is<00:05:00.060> your<00:05:00.570> second

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
here to the third this is your second

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.129 
here to the third this is your second
weave<00:05:01.710> pattern<00:05:02.250> which<00:05:03.210> was<00:05:03.389> one<00:05:03.660> two<00:05:03.840> three

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
weave pattern which was one two three

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.800 
weave pattern which was one two three
and<00:05:04.380> then<00:05:04.500> two<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.860> five<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:06.270> can<00:05:06.479> see<00:05:06.660> that

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
and then two to five you can see that

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.570 
and then two to five you can see that
that<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.350> last<00:05:07.620> thing<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:07.919> did<00:05:08.280> and

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
that was the last thing you did and

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.390 
that was the last thing you did and
you're<00:05:09.300> ready<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.810> do<00:05:10.020> your<00:05:10.530> weave<00:05:10.950> pattern

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
you're ready to do your weave pattern
