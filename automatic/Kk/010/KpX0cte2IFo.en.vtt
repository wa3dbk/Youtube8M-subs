 called she in my heart 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.519
 and first decided to present it in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.650

 which subsequently never 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.910
 met new creation was given 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 a woman is not easy tatyana admits that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.369
 writing it was morally difficult she 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 heavy heavy not in narration 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.310
 namely these thoughts that are me 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 accompanied while writing I 'll go 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.219

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.489

 in and of itself and I am good love for 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 creativity tatyana sometimes poured into 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.629
 something out of the ordinary once in short supply 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 years she even stole a book from the library 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 true then anyway for her 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.870
 paid off 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 writing activities woman 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
 took up the ninety-fifth year and after 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.469
 the first book she was dubbed the founder 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.149
 ironic detective story and when i wrote 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.719
 my first book 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.640
 it was so very similar to anything 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.830
 and long tormented and tried me with 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 someone compare in the end compared 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.180
 with a pony hop probably 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.850
 so wonderful polish 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.580
 writers I think would not have come in 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 delight and if I found out about it now 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 same tatyana wears an unspoken title 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.159
 the founder of the adventurous detective and to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 to this she also refers quite 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.659
 skeptical women released about 70 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.299
 books that sold the general circulation 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.280

 among them the films thin little thing, and hell 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.049
 two 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.119
 as well as the TV series obstinate target and how 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.130
 neither so many others the truth says 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.170
 tatyana screenwriters sometimes change already 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.670
 unrecognizability take at least the series shot 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.659
 according to her book the millionaire wishes 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.659
 become acquainted 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.970
 I would have recognized him for nothing if not 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.610
 called and warned me when I 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.470
 turned on the TV to be honest to me 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 watch can not say anything about him 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.500
 it's too early to talk about success 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.390
