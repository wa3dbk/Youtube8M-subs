asking me how do you draw a straight
line<00:00:09.929> freehand<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.769> way<00:00:10.860> you'd<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.340> your

videos and it's really not free and I'm

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.369 
videos and it's really not free and I'm
using<00:00:14.910> my<00:00:15.030> fingernail<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> guide<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
using my fingernail as a guide and this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.380 
using my fingernail as a guide and this
is<00:00:16.529> something<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.039> learned<00:00:17.340> when<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.090> first

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
is something that I learned when I first

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269 
is something that I learned when I first
started<00:00:18.660> woodworking<00:00:18.900> I've<00:00:19.590> been<00:00:19.830> using<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
started woodworking I've been using it

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
started woodworking I've been using it
ever<00:00:20.430> since<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.300> useful<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.900> I'm

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
ever since and it's really useful so I'm

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
ever since and it's really useful so I'm
gonna<00:00:22.050> bring<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> camera<00:00:22.740> over<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.400> show<00:00:23.609> you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
gonna bring the camera over and show you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
gonna bring the camera over and show you
exactly<00:00:24.000> how<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.420> done

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
exactly how it's done

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
exactly how it's done
you<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> nice<00:00:26.160> sharp<00:00:26.400> point<00:00:26.789> on

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you want to have a nice sharp point on

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
you want to have a nice sharp point on
your<00:00:27.029> pencil<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.500> fingernail

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
your pencil and you use your fingernail

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.250 
your pencil and you use your fingernail
as<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> guide<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.000> run<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> along<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.779> edge<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
as a guide and run it along the edge of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.620 
as a guide and run it along the edge of
the<00:00:31.349> board<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.730> nice<00:00:32.910> thing<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the board and the nice thing about this

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
the board and the nice thing about this
is<00:00:33.899> over<00:00:34.710> time<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.370> eye<00:00:35.399> becomes<00:00:36.210> trained

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
is over time your eye becomes trained

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
is over time your eye becomes trained
and<00:00:36.989> you'll<00:00:37.559> find<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.329> visualize

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and you'll find that you can visualize

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
and you'll find that you can visualize
what<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.840> inch<00:00:40.020> looks<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.950> 3/8<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> an

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
what an inch looks like or 3/8 of an

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.639 
what an inch looks like or 3/8 of an
inch<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.000> often<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> won't<00:00:43.200> even<00:00:43.379> use<00:00:43.500> your

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
inch and often you won't even use your

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
inch and often you won't even use your
tape<00:00:44.010> measure<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.879> let's<00:00:45.120> say<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:46.200> was

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
tape measure so let's say I was this was

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
tape measure so let's say I was this was
a<00:00:46.379> face<00:00:46.680> frame<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.399> was<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
a face frame and I was going to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.470 
a face frame and I was going to
pre-drill<00:00:48.870> holes<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:50.239> screwing<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.300> face

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
pre-drill holes for screwing the face

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
pre-drill holes for screwing the face
frame<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> cabinet<00:00:52.410> I'd<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
frame to the cabinet I'd want to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
frame to the cabinet I'd want to
pre-drill<00:00:53.850> those<00:00:54.090> holes<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.989> 3/8<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.590> an<00:00:55.739> inch

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
pre-drill those holes at 3/8 of an inch

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
pre-drill those holes at 3/8 of an inch
so<00:00:56.539> I'm<00:00:57.539> thinking<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.140> looks<00:00:58.379> pretty<00:00:58.710> close

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so I'm thinking that looks pretty close

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.130 
so I'm thinking that looks pretty close
to<00:00:59.100> 3/8<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.670> inch

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
to 3/8 of an inch

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
to 3/8 of an inch
and<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.160> there<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and it's right there so that's what

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.299 
and it's right there so that's what
happens<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> long<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> enough

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
happens you do it long you do it enough

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
happens you do it long you do it enough
and<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:06.090> eye<00:01:06.119> becomes<00:01:06.570> trained<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> you'll

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and your eye becomes trained and you'll

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.609 
and your eye becomes trained and you'll
find<00:01:07.830> yourself<00:01:08.220> using<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.450> tool<00:01:09.900> all

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
find yourself using this as a tool all

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.330 
find yourself using this as a tool all
the<00:01:10.770> time<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.990> also<00:01:12.990> wanted<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> answer<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the time I also wanted to answer the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
the time I also wanted to answer the
main<00:01:14.520> question<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:15.060> been<00:01:15.090> getting<00:01:15.240> about

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
main question I've been getting about

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.170 
main question I've been getting about
the<00:01:15.780> blanket<00:01:16.170> chest<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the blanket chest and that is if you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
the blanket chest and that is if you
didn't<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> paint<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.590> would<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
didn't want to paint it how would you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310 
didn't want to paint it how would you
build<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.119> easy<00:01:21.330> answer<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.900> building

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
build it and the easy answer is building

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
build it and the easy answer is building
out<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> pine<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.310> pine<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
out a pine you can get pine and all of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.810 
out a pine you can get pine and all of
your<00:01:24.930> pine<00:01:25.170> moldings<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.770> almost<00:01:26.340> any<00:01:26.580> home

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
your pine moldings at almost any home

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
your pine moldings at almost any home
store<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.630> any<00:01:27.840> home<00:01:28.049> store<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
store I would think any home store and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.850 
store I would think any home store and
any<00:01:29.280> lumberyard<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.320> somebody<00:01:31.320> mentioned

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
any lumberyard now somebody mentioned

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210 
any lumberyard now somebody mentioned
wanting<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> build<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> cherry<00:01:33.380> walnut<00:01:34.380> or

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
wanting to build out of cherry walnut or

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.539 
wanting to build out of cherry walnut or
maple<00:01:35.549> even<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.740> becomes<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.430> bit

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
maple even and that becomes a little bit

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.179 
maple even and that becomes a little bit
more<00:01:38.670> difficult<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.650> your<00:01:40.650> mouldings

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
more difficult because your mouldings

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.620 
more difficult because your mouldings
are<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.509> your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
are you're gonna have to have your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.080 
are you're gonna have to have your
moldings<00:01:43.020> made<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> mill<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.970> are

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
moldings made at a mill or there are

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.260 
moldings made at a mill or there are
some<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.630> good<00:01:46.020> lumber<00:01:47.009> yards<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.670> carry

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
some really good lumber yards that carry

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
some really good lumber yards that carry
stock<00:01:48.720> moldings<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> different<00:01:49.829> species<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
stock moldings and different species the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.870 
stock moldings and different species the
other<00:01:51.659> case<00:01:52.409> would<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> mold<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
other case would be to make the mold in

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
other case would be to make the mold in
yourself<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> lot<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> these<00:01:54.869> moldings<00:01:55.259> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
yourself now a lot of these moldings you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.420 
yourself now a lot of these moldings you
could<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> router<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
could make with a router the the the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
could make with a router the the the
base<00:01:59.640> cap<00:01:59.909> molding<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.840> would

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
base cap molding that I use that would

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
base cap molding that I use that would
be<00:02:01.110> difficult<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.619> make<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> router<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.460> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
be difficult to make with a router but I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.630 
be difficult to make with a router but I
think<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.070> also

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
think you can do you can do that I also

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.789 
think you can do you can do that I also
I've<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> machine<00:02:06.869> called<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.290> Williams<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
I've got a machine called a Williams and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
I've got a machine called a Williams and
husky<00:02:08.099> molding<00:02:08.459> planer<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> I'll<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.780> just

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
husky molding planer and I'll just just

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.999 
husky molding planer and I'll just just
kind<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> show

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
kind of show

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
kind of show
little<00:02:11.220> diner<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.760> how<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.090> works<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
little diner and how that works and that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.479 
little diner and how that works and that
would<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.560> other<00:02:13.680> route<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.280> does

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
would be the other route but that does

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.670 
would be the other route but that does
make<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.090> project<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:16.319> bit<00:02:16.470> more

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
make the project a little bit more

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.800 
make the project a little bit more
difficult<00:02:17.189> and<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:17.610> expensive<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.689> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
difficult and more expensive this is the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.420 
difficult and more expensive this is the
molding<00:02:19.140> cleaner<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.590> I'd<00:02:19.709> mentioned<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
molding cleaner that I'd mentioned and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.970 
molding cleaner that I'd mentioned and
it<00:02:20.700> works<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> lot<00:02:21.299> like<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.540> thickness<00:02:21.810> planer

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
it works a lot like a thickness planer

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.830 
it works a lot like a thickness planer
but<00:02:22.980> instead<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> straight<00:02:23.730> knife<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.720> have

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
but instead of a straight knife you have

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.630 
but instead of a straight knife you have
different<00:02:25.319> blades<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.920> create<00:02:26.310> different

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
different blades that create different

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.059 
different blades that create different
moldings<00:02:27.049> so<00:02:28.049> for<00:02:28.260> instance<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
moldings so for instance this is the

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.220 
moldings so for instance this is the
cutting<00:02:29.489> knife<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> base<00:02:30.299> cap<00:02:30.569> molding<00:02:30.989> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
cutting knife for a base cap molding and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.399 
cutting knife for a base cap molding and
I'll<00:02:31.739> trace<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.459> knife<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.959> basically

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
I'll trace the knife and it's basically

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.649 
I'll trace the knife and it's basically
the<00:02:34.530> negative<00:02:34.739> if<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.610> pull<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.000> away<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
the negative if I pull that away and

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.860 
the negative if I pull that away and
then<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.500> draw<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.299> see<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.720> is

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
then just draw and you can see this is

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.300 
then just draw and you can see this is
the<00:02:39.959> molding<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.439> you<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:40.709> get<00:02:40.920> if<00:02:41.250> you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
the molding that you would get if you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.809 
the molding that you would get if you
ran<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.790> through<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:41.970> machine<00:02:43.579> so<00:02:44.579> if<00:02:44.670> you're

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
ran it through the machine so if you're

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.640 
ran it through the machine so if you're
wondering<00:02:45.239> well<00:02:45.629> why<00:02:45.870> not<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.140> make<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
wondering well why not just make the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.949 
wondering well why not just make the
molding<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.220> project<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
molding for this project you know the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.289 
molding for this project you know the
answer<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.379> it's<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.099> lot<00:02:50.250> easier<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.030> buy

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
answer is it's just a lot easier to buy

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.149 
answer is it's just a lot easier to buy
the<00:02:51.359> molding<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> home<00:02:52.650> store<00:02:52.920> or

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
the molding at the home store or

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.729 
the molding at the home store or
lumberyard<00:02:53.700> now<00:02:54.239> if<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.230> wanted<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.590> build

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
lumberyard now if you wanted to build

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.559 
lumberyard now if you wanted to build
this<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.190> stain<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:56.970> some<00:02:57.420> kind

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
this and stain it and have it some kind

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.500 
this and stain it and have it some kind
of<00:02:57.599> a<00:02:57.690> natural<00:02:57.870> wood<00:02:58.290> color<00:02:58.670> your<00:02:59.670> easiest<00:03:00.269> and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
of a natural wood color your easiest and

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.300 
of a natural wood color your easiest and
most<00:03:00.540> inexpensive<00:03:00.959> solution<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:01.859> going<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.129> be

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
most inexpensive solution is going to be

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.759 
most inexpensive solution is going to be
to<00:03:02.430> build<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.819> out<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.209> pine<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:04.319> could<00:03:04.560> build

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
to build it out of pine you could build

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.240 
to build it out of pine you could build
it<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.069> walnut<00:03:05.790> or<00:03:06.299> maple<00:03:07.139> or<00:03:07.319> cherry<00:03:07.349> but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it out of walnut or maple or cherry but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.970 
it out of walnut or maple or cherry but
that's<00:03:08.670> definitely<00:03:09.329> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.629> increase<00:03:10.409> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that's definitely going to increase the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.129 
that's definitely going to increase the
price<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.549> bill<00:03:11.849> I'm<00:03:12.389> gonna<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.720> back<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
price of the bill I'm gonna get back to

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.780 
price of the bill I'm gonna get back to
painting<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> blanket<00:03:13.950> chest<00:03:14.190> I'll<00:03:14.549> see<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
painting the blanket chest I'll see you

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.180 
painting the blanket chest I'll see you
on<00:03:14.879> Friday
