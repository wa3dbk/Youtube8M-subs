00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.729
 I'm from the session I show you the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.729
 new videos good serie 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.270
 the brand new wgs ​​ruth series on 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.280
 every concept thought through 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.510
 American model built and what 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.070
 is finally nice in this 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.100
 Cheap just when I have a movie 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.260
 Cheap are actually almost all 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.580
 Instruments manufactured in Asia and the 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.020
 not here that is a European 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.480
 instrument which will be in romania 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.640
 made of high quality materials 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 then, for example, I just have it here 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.840
 a spruce top that has been for years 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.000
 dried out one also easily notices 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.830
 And that's always a good sign 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.150
 just what the durability of holders 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.950
 As or when you've been traveling that 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.020
 has humidity fluctuations and so on 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 then just a blanket is the years 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 it has always been dry for a long time 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 a plus body is made of mahogany 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.070
 Here are the two links from the plastic 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.620
 and just stop it 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.360
 mahogany mechanics features mechanics 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.960
 then i have plastic saddle and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.660
 the whole system almost mensur of 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.130
 648 millimeters and so I have to now 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.250
 she was of playability 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.840
 now quite enjoyable the fingerboard 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.190
 is not made of rosewood , either 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.370
 any soft used today 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.130
 but just a hard wood itself 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 not by pressing and thus offers just 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.900
 up here in the upper layers were relative 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.420
 pleasant playing feeling and sounds very much 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.730
 loud as you actually heard that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.170
 is actually how many instruments in 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.820
 the price range rather something sound 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.040
 behave it does not work there you can 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.500
 In any case, accompany well with 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.690
 And you will definitely not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.880
 to be quiet as an instrument 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.700
 just done by a team at 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.070
 designers and, above all, musicians 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.519
 You can tell that you notice the instrument 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.650
 so it's on then 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.380
 instrument of music for musicians 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.820
 has been designed and easy in 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.959
 the price range very pleasant 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.410
 They come in different variants 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.959
 So that's the cd from now 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.510
 us series in ns that is the natural 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.340
 sata this is the matte finish 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.200
 this sounds like this instrument now 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.390
 in that case a bit more open the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.190
 is there then without this system what 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.840
 built here he is still 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.390
 a tick cheaper with that is 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280
 one must say system is then simply 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.660
 a cheap variant around sometimes 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.150
 the stage with it 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.840
 I have a very simple system here 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.910
 where I have a tuner just one 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.420
 volume control a phase rotation 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.489
 basses and heights and as I said also without 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.420
 system available and the same gives 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.890
 it then as an asb 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.750
 Variant is it then it is actually 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.650
 only this sunburst and this then 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.390
 high gloss lacquered 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.799
 I always find the very interesting 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.150
 Comparison between the two 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.310
 instruments if I have a matte now 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.040
 directly with a high-gloss guitar 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.390
 can compare sounds like that has the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.170
 glossy just a bit 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.269
 a bit more simple and easy 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.070
 for many players it is a bit 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.080
 more pleasant that is not the break 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.419
 forward with that is very direct 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.880
 sound the guitar arrives immediately and at 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.990
 of the brands in the high-gloss 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.490
 Guitar is a bit of a whole 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.400
 restrained for many, maybe too 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.229
 just have a more pleasant sound then 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.020
 I still other variants of that 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:42.960
 instrument and then respectively the ce 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.030
 variant the ce variant is then the 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.020
 Variant with the kadewe 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.780
 they are also available in different 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.700
 Variations again so here it is 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.860
 simply the glossy black 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.889
 Guitar also just a fashionable color 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.060
 many just stand on this black 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.300
 and then you hear it then I think so too 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.300
 that it 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.960
 that sounds a bit more subdued 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.110
 does not have this direct address of 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.310
 here and there, but they are also in the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.710
 Variant with the cutaway and the and 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.170
 pickup also in the high gloss of the 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.210
 matt optics then I have the west part 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.320
 Incidentally, this means everlaunch bridge 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:39.080
 simply the form of that of the one of 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.150
 footbridge and otherwise is the same 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.410
 So the blanket is here 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.400
 just as spruce what you are now 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.330
 of course with the black paint 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.430
 can not see 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.220
 the ground is made of mahogany and as well 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.780
 the frames of course also in the 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.870
 of course, that's different 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.900
 system built into each system 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.760
 it just has a closer equalizer 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.980
 and this is for the stage use 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.560
 a bit more detailed usable 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.050
 otherwise they are similar in sound 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.390
 even if I now have this variant here 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.160
 have with cutaway and the present system 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.720
 the sounds that sound almost then 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.770
 the same thing must be said, that's what it does 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.860
 no big difference between me now 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.330
 have or the cutaway in there not 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.070
 I would just say we are listening 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.600
 which arrives again in the business over 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.640
 try that with the different ones 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.050
 paint what they do and that 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.580
 opportunity has unfortunately many 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.040
 other manufacturers do not 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.610
 and then you can learn a lot 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.610
 definitely
