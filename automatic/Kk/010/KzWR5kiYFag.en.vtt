00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the Raspberry Ketones they got a lot

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
the Raspberry Ketones they got a lot
more<00:00:22.529> popular<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.340> came<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.699> dr.<00:00:24.000> oz<00:00:24.029> so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
Ram what do they do what are they for

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720 
Ram what do they do what are they for
how<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.380> use<00:00:28.410> them<00:00:28.859> whenever<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.250> take<00:00:29.460> them

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
how do we use them whenever I take them

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
how do we use them whenever I take them
so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> went<00:00:30.750> ahead<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.960> did<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.199> bit<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
so I went ahead and did a little bit of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
so I went ahead and did a little bit of
research<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.809> what<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> found

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
research on them you know what I found

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
research on them you know what I found
was<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.260> raspberry<00:00:34.530> ketones<00:00:35.130> aren't

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
was that raspberry ketones aren't

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.979 
was that raspberry ketones aren't
exactly<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> newest<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.750> hit<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
exactly like the newest thing to hit the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.660 
exactly like the newest thing to hit the
market<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.559> fact<00:00:38.040> they've<00:00:38.190> been<00:00:38.340> around<00:00:38.520> since

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
market in fact they've been around since

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
market in fact they've been around since
the<00:00:38.820> 1960s<00:00:39.719> actually<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.559> were<00:00:40.590> approved<00:00:40.980> by

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the 1960s actually they were approved by

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.540 
the 1960s actually they were approved by
the<00:00:41.190> FDA<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.879> about<00:00:42.059> nineteen<00:00:42.510> sixty-five<00:00:43.550> so

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the FDA in about nineteen sixty-five so

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
the FDA in about nineteen sixty-five so
they're<00:00:44.700> safe<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
they're safe what they are is there a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
they're safe what they are is there a
concentrated<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.730> extract<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
concentrated like extract of the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.229 
concentrated like extract of the
raspberry<00:00:48.960> ketone<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.700> take<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:50.940> 90

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
raspberry ketone it would take about 90

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
raspberry ketone it would take about 90
pounds<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:52.020> raspberries<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> hundred

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
pounds of raspberries to get a hundred

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.389 
pounds of raspberries to get a hundred
milligrams<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.809> ketones<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:56.219> else<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
milligrams of the ketones what else I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
milligrams of the ketones what else I
got<00:00:56.460> let's<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.809> idea<00:00:58.079> behind<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
got let's see the idea behind them is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
got let's see the idea behind them is
you're<00:00:58.620> trying<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> raise<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.520> epitome

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you're trying to raise the epitome

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
you're trying to raise the epitome
nechtan<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> hormone<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.469> body<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
nechtan it's a hormone in your body that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
nechtan it's a hormone in your body that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
energy so you supplement with the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.399 
energy so you supplement with the
raspberry<00:01:07.890> ketones<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.360> also<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
raspberry ketones you know also it's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.490 
raspberry ketones you know also it's
supposed<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.090> slice<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.330> body<00:01:12.630> fat<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.290> I

day um what I found was like I think

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
day um what I found was like I think
it'll<00:01:43.619> work<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.130> you're<00:01:44.220> consistent<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.180> know

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it'll work if you're consistent you know

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.429
