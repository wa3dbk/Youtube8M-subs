already experimenting about having an
MLS<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.939> prevent<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.960> fix<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> yeah

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
MLS you can prevent it and fix it yeah

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
MLS you can prevent it and fix it yeah
just<00:01:40.829> try<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> brush<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.640> teeth<00:01:41.909> about<00:01:42.150> half
