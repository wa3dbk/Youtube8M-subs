00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.740
 thanks for tuning in a new one 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.570
 slow and respond and now we start 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.400
 with a question from danny that we 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.350
 consult what is the trend in 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.930
 enamels danny for this 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.420
 spring-summer we always have these 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.410
 colors to which we resort every 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.449
 spring-summer just as they can 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.340
 be the coral the super bright pink that 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.710
 they are colors that look very nice when 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.840
 we are with tanned skin now opi 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.000
 for example it comes with a proposal that 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.460
 it is called the liquid sun or the enamels 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.230
 in arena 2 as well as there are the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.110
 matte tones that for example have them 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 orly do not do not lose sight of that 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.829
 always in spring-summer we are going to 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.920
 procure the bright tones the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.510
 fluorine colors for example no and good with 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.610
 glazes as well as red by 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.370
 example I the charms to red nails 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 it's something that will never go out of style 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.430
 that you should not lose sight of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.230
 example for the youngest is something that 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.989
 it also comes with a lot of force are 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.309
 the incrustations of brilliant or by 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.199
 example the tachas embedded in the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.570
 nails is something that also going to be 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.340
 as a trend of following queries of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.869
 jimÃ©nez comes via twitter she wants 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.150
 know what is the ring trend of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.950
 engagement gold white gold red 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.450
 if the ring and the ring should be 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.790
 same color 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.560
 If we want to know trends, we have to 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.680
 turn and blame kate 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.390
 middleton that she has imposed a little 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.930
 using a ring with a diamond 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.550
 colour 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.070
 in fact the blue color let's say it's the 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.450
 color of rings that is fashionable not 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.700
 but beyond that look at the lonely 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.100
 the classic diamond cut the cut 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.410
 emerald the princess cut are a 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.660
 diamond cuts that remain 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.610
 super effective since the time of 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.200
 our grannies until today 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.240
 I think that goes more with the style and 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.680
 the personality of each one in my case 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.600
 for example I was dying for a version 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.130
 of my mom's ring that is like a 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.050
 pink then the me is a little rose 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.580
 small but it is something that I wanted and 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470
 that for me it had a very meaning 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.240
 special because I wanted it to look like 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.580
 ring that she had then I think that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.979
 that's super personal and about the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.840
 combinations of white gold yellow gold 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.670
 I think you can combine I've seen them 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.950
 couples of friends who do it even 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.230
 couples in which the yellow dim her 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 has white gold there is no trend 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.360
 defined in terms of gold colors 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.980
 and also the choice of cutting 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.079
 diamond has to be and it has to be 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.970
 very faithful and reflect the bride the 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.069
 next question is from carla and she 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.689
 he wants to know if I worked twice 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.819
 as they clarify to clarify the armpits 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.040
 this topic also comes in reference to 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.500
 a post that we did previously 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.810
 truth is that I've been using it now 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.659
 yes several weeks and the difference has 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.430
 been a lot really I can tell you 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.440
 that I have seen results will also be 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.390
 because I've used it with soap 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.409
 though then suddenly it's like 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.150
 when you use a time and a re 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.769
 conditioner of the same brand 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.329
 I think that using deodorant and 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.299
 soap of the same brand I think 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.709
 you really see a little the results of 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.540
 suddenly more quickly 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.140
 personally it has worked for me 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.750
 all right 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.459
 and good every skin of every woman is 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.620
 different so the result is going to 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.050
 depend on each one but personally 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.550
 I advise you try what I can 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.330
 say that for my side the results have 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.069
 been very good 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.360

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.220
 questions already know that any 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.140
 I see they can do either
