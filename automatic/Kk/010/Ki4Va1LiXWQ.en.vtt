 their space companies are now in 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.530
 connection with the response decision of Moscow under

 the news was commented kept and on 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.479
 this lounge alliance hope that 12 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.490
 will be able to produce effective negotiations 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.649
 over the coming months and allow 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.299
 the issues that have arisen between the alliance and 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.610
 US Department of Defense have a plan

 scheduled for November and existing 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.209
 stock according to the company is enough for two 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
 years but can it be used 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.380
 After all, in Moscow they stated that in the case of 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.300
 military launches will stop and service 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.459
 maintenance of already delivered motors 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.350
 unexpectedly streamlined peacefully 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.640
 commented on in the State Department and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.410
 other plans of Russia 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.880
 and wisaev we have been cooperating for a long time 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.630
 with Russians in space and I hope so 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.850
 will continue 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.080
 we still continue to operation on 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.510
 a whole series of questions 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.780
 The fact is that the USA has large 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.880
 plans for at least 2024 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.590

 Mars 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.840
 show even up to ms without russia 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.060
 you will reach Russia now 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.550
 provides delivery of all astronauts and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.500
 astronauts on the ms but she can't 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.930
 alone manage the station as well as 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.000
 Usa is very addicted here friend 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.950
 it turned out from a friend that there is a dependency 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.510
 and in securing the work of american 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.019
 gps navigation system 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.790
 11 out of 150 and ground stations are located 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.840
 in Russia to increase 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.090
 signal accuracy 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.860
 when did it come to placement exactly 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 the same stations only for the Russian 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.660
 GLONASS systems in the US, Moscow 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 in fact received a denial in congress 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.299
 resent why should we encourage 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.519
 competitor 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.280
 and the Pentagon opposed this saying 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.320
 threats to national security was not 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.340
 no progress in negotiations on 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.340
 placement 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.320
 similar embarrassment and culture glonass 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.520

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.510
 time remains 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.730
 resolution of this issue from June 1, we 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.740
 suspend operation of the plant tag gps 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.630
 on the territory of the Russian Federation with 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.370
 such a new bargaining position 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.950
 another round will begin 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.660
 discussions if finding a common language is not 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.640
 turn out from the first of September all 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.340
 DPS ground stations in the territory 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.440

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.420
 say experts 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.190
 but the American high-precision
