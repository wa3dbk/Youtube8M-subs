about flying on this aircraft and it's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.900 
about flying on this aircraft and it's
also<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.010> significant<00:01:41.490> improvement<00:01:41.580> on

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
also a significant improvement on

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.940 
also a significant improvement on
environmental<00:01:42.540> impact<00:01:42.810> sixty<00:01:43.470> percent<00:01:43.590> less

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
environmental impact sixty percent less

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710 
environmental impact sixty percent less
noise<00:01:44.160> out<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.580> aircraft<00:01:44.820> twenty

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
noise out of this aircraft twenty

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
noise out of this aircraft twenty
percent<00:01:45.960> less<00:01:46.140> emissions<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.190> it's<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
percent less emissions so it's going to
