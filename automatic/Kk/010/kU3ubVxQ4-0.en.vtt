there's<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> door

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
there's the door

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:38.240 
there's the door
it<00:00:27.310> opens<00:00:27.609> up<00:00:27.730> with<00:00:27.910> solar<00:00:28.179> power

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.210 

here's<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:38.970> battery<00:00:39.560> that<00:00:40.560> operates<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
here's the battery that operates the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.970 
here's the battery that operates the
door<00:00:41.450> when<00:00:42.450> wire<00:00:42.690> goes<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> door<00:00:43.500> the

all<00:00:56.650> right<00:00:56.800> in<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:56.980> solar<00:00:57.250> panel<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.800> up<00:01:00.010> here

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
all right in the solar panel is up here

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.290 
all right in the solar panel is up here
and<00:01:01.780> it's<00:01:02.020> simple<00:01:02.440> son<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.610> solar<00:01:03.850> panels

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
and it's simple son is the solar panels

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.600 
and it's simple son is the solar panels
solar<00:01:04.449> panel<00:01:04.870> charges<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.350> battery<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:05.980> a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
solar panel charges the battery and a

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.190 
solar panel charges the battery and a
battery<00:01:06.910> open<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.300> close<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.600> door<00:01:07.660> it's<00:01:07.990> set

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
battery open and close the door it's set

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.400 
battery open and close the door it's set
on<00:01:08.230> a<00:01:08.380> timer<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.040> nesting<00:01:12.460> boxes<00:01:13.410> is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
on a timer and it's the nesting boxes is

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.620 
on a timer and it's the nesting boxes is
the<00:01:14.620> rain<00:01:14.830> barrel<00:01:15.810> there's<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.990> gutter<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
the rain barrel there's the gutter the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.870 
the rain barrel there's the gutter the
rain<00:01:19.840> barrel<00:01:20.260> I<00:01:20.440> can<00:01:20.710> open<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.130> file<00:01:21.400> here

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
rain barrel I can open this file here

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.469 
rain barrel I can open this file here
get<00:01:22.870> water<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.760> running<00:01:24.760> into<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.120> chicken

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
get water and running into the chicken

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.070 
get water and running into the chicken
run<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:25.990> then<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.010> other<00:01:27.250> hose<00:01:27.960> under<00:01:28.960> the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
run and then this other hose under the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.960 
run and then this other hose under the
chicken<00:01:29.440> coop<00:01:29.650> is<00:01:29.830> another<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.369> chicken<00:01:30.759> run

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
chicken coop is another the chicken run

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.150 
chicken coop is another the chicken run
and<00:01:32.430> since<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.610> water<00:01:33.790> is<00:01:34.000> gravity-fed<00:01:34.509> I

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
and since the water is gravity-fed I

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.510 
and since the water is gravity-fed I
have<00:01:36.160> their<00:01:36.369> water<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.300> nipples<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:37.930> an<00:01:38.050> angle

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
have their water the nipples on an angle

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.710 
have their water the nipples on an angle
so<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.550> one<00:01:39.910> on<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.270> very<00:01:40.690> end<00:01:41.229> over<00:01:41.560> here

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so the one on the very end over here

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.030 
so the one on the very end over here
gets<00:01:43.720> water

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.310 

look<00:01:46.670> at<00:01:46.820> what<00:01:47.030> I'm<00:01:47.240> playing<00:01:47.480> in<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.720> room
