just tried to figure out a way to make

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.680 
just tried to figure out a way to make
scent<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.730> leave<00:00:25.850> so<00:00:26.060> that<00:00:26.210> they<00:00:26.330> would<00:00:26.480> match

scent and leave so that they would match

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.180 
scent and leave so that they would match
and<00:00:27.490> I'm<00:00:28.490> not<00:00:28.730> sure<00:00:28.880> if<00:00:29.000> there's<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.210> video<00:00:30.190> on

how to make certain leaves like this
there<00:00:34.790> very<00:00:35.059> well<00:00:35.090> could<00:00:35.239> be<00:00:35.450> an<00:00:35.719> easier

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
there very well could be an easier

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.639 
there very well could be an easier
faster<00:00:37.179> way<00:00:38.179> of<00:00:38.210> making<00:00:38.690> them<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.019> if<00:00:39.230> I<00:00:39.350> find

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
faster way of making them and if I find

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.479 
so like that see you will have an angle
and<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.700> cut<00:02:17.880> edge<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:19.709> want<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.980> hold<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.310> as

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
and a cut edge so we want to hold it as
close<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.480> they're<00:02:21.750> sort<00:02:22.110> of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
close as we can so that they're sort of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
close as we can so that they're sort of
together<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:23.910> when<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.270> get<00:02:24.390> our

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
together and this is when we get our

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.949 
together and this is when we get our
liner<00:02:25.130> now<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.640> best<00:02:26.819> way<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> find<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.690> for

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
liner now the best way I find is for

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.449 
liner now the best way I find is for
quick<00:02:28.730> movements<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.860> objective<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
quick movements and the objective that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.370 
quick movements and the objective that
we<00:02:32.580> want<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.060> fuse<00:02:33.600> these<00:02:33.840> two<00:02:33.900> ends

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
we want is to fuse these two ends

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.309 
we want is to fuse these two ends
together<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.720> what<00:02:36.840> takes<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.170> little

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
together so this is what takes a little

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.280 
together so this is what takes a little
bit<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.530> practice<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:38.100> want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> burn<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.290> long

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
bit of practice you want to burn it long

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.410 
bit of practice you want to burn it long
enough<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.010> fuses<00:02:41.370> melts<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.000> fuses

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
enough so that it fuses melts and fuses

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.370 
enough so that it fuses melts and fuses
together<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:43.260> not<00:02:43.350> long<00:02:43.530> enough<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> goes

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
together but not long enough so it goes

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.530 
together but not long enough so it goes
ugly<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.560> burnt<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.069> melted<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.120> gross<00:02:48.360> and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
ugly and burnt and melted and gross and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.830 
ugly and burnt and melted and gross and
the<00:02:49.140> line<00:02:49.380> between<00:02:49.730> not<00:02:50.730> enough<00:02:51.030> into<00:02:51.420> much<00:02:51.600> is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the line between not enough into much is

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.170 
the line between not enough into much is
really<00:02:52.410> fun<00:02:52.650> guys<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.790> what<00:02:54.060> will

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
really fun guys so this is what will

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.550 
really fun guys so this is what will
take<00:02:54.299> predators<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.190> make<00:02:56.640> sure<00:02:56.880> our

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
take predators so we just make sure our

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.559 
take predators so we just make sure our
sin<00:02:58.560> things<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.130> we<00:02:59.190> just<00:03:00.080> Suns<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.319> end<00:03:01.530> and

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
sin things and we just Suns the end and

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.930 
sin things and we just Suns the end and
I<00:03:03.569> find<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.290> instead<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.280> holding<00:03:05.549> at<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
I find that instead of holding at the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.569 
I find that instead of holding at the
end<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:07.260> know<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.410> bringing<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.130> down<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
end you know and bringing it down and

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.640 
end you know and bringing it down and
then<00:03:08.700> pressing<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.299> together<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.930> find<00:03:10.500> it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
then pressing it together I find it's

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.620 
then pressing it together I find it's
better<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.310> quick<00:03:14.000> oopsie<00:03:15.000> nearly

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
better to do this quick oopsie nearly

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.560 
better to do this quick oopsie nearly
too<00:03:15.810> much<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:17.190> means<00:03:17.370> stop<00:03:17.760> Tasha<00:03:18.090> before

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
too much that means stop Tasha before

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.349 
too much that means stop Tasha before
you<00:03:18.690> miss<00:03:18.840> us<00:03:19.019> up<00:03:19.200> on<00:03:19.380> video<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> what<00:03:21.209> you

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
you miss us up on video so what you

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.600 
you miss us up on video so what you
should<00:03:21.570> end<00:03:21.600> up<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.019> something<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:23.220> that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.820 

so<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.570> what<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.840> need<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.050> do<00:03:29.260> is<00:03:29.440> grab<00:03:29.710> our

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
so then what we need to do is grab our

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.680 
so then what we need to do is grab our
needle<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.190> thread<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.700> you'll<00:03:31.390> notice

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
needle and thread and you'll notice

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.360 
needle and thread and you'll notice
there's<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.990> long<00:03:32.200> edge<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:33.490> a<00:03:34.360> short<00:03:34.660> edge<00:03:34.900> and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
there's a long edge and a short edge and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.330 
there's a long edge and a short edge and
the<00:03:36.370> edge<00:03:36.400> we<00:03:36.790> want<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:38.490> put<00:03:39.490> our<00:03:39.610> needle<00:03:39.820> into

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the edge we want to put our needle into

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
the edge we want to put our needle into
here's<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.490> edge<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:42.970> bent<00:03:43.240> is<00:03:43.450> right

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
here's the edge that we bent is right

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.390 
here's the edge that we bent is right
here<00:03:44.530> in<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.830> little<00:03:45.160> corner<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.400> we

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
here in this little corner here and we

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.020 
along the short edge and we want to do
little<00:03:53.380> stitches<00:03:53.920> because<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.640> bigger<00:03:54.850> the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030

if they're not little stitches there'll
be<00:04:01.720> little<00:04:01.960> holes<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:03.600> that's<00:04:04.600> ugly

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.999 

and<00:04:44.569> then<00:04:46.599> we<00:04:47.599> put<00:04:47.900> our<00:04:47.930> needle<00:04:48.229> in<00:04:48.470> at<00:04:48.710> that

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
and then we put our needle in at that

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.980 
and then we put our needle in at that
little<00:04:49.160> corner<00:04:50.050> we<00:04:51.050> open<00:04:52.039> our<00:04:52.509> ribbon<00:04:53.509> up<00:04:53.720> and

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
little corner we open our ribbon up and

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.080 
little corner we open our ribbon up and
we<00:04:54.319> just<00:04:54.349> push<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.039> corner<00:04:55.460> so<00:04:55.490> that<00:04:55.789> it<00:04:55.910> pops

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
we just push that corner so that it pops

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:04.189 
we just push that corner so that it pops
up<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:57.800> so

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.879 

and<00:05:04.710> then<00:05:05.150> what<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.180> do<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.449> I<00:05:06.659> just<00:05:06.689> hold<00:05:07.620> these

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
and then what I do is I just hold these

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.110 
and then what I do is I just hold these
two<00:05:08.099> end<00:05:08.279> together<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:09.210> then<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.139> put<00:05:10.409> a

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
two end together and then just put a

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.040 
two end together and then just put a
couple<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.360> stitches<00:05:12.509> in<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.110> air

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.430 
doing I was just thinking you know if
you<00:06:41.909> wanted<00:06:42.180> to<00:06:42.240> use<00:06:42.449> other<00:06:42.630> kind<00:06:42.930> of<00:06:43.020> fabric

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
you wanted to use other kind of fabric

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.080 
you wanted to use other kind of fabric
like<00:06:43.620> I<00:06:43.770> still<00:06:44.009> feel<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:44.280> leaves<00:06:44.729> or

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
like I still feel that leaves or

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.600 
like I still feel that leaves or
something<00:06:45.449> like<00:06:45.539> that

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
something like that

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.279 
something like that
obviously<00:06:47.610> you<00:06:47.669> can't<00:06:47.970> turn<00:06:48.599> to<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:48.840> ears<00:06:49.080> but

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
obviously you can't turn to the ears but

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.140 
obviously you can't turn to the ears but
maybe<00:06:49.470> you<00:06:49.590> could<00:06:49.740> glue<00:06:50.550> the<00:06:50.699> edge<00:06:50.849> and<00:06:51.030> get

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
maybe you could glue the edge and get

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.909 
maybe you could glue the edge and get
the<00:06:51.270> same<00:06:51.419> effect<00:06:51.599> I'm<00:06:51.990> not<00:06:52.259> sure<00:06:52.409> I<00:06:52.440> haven't
