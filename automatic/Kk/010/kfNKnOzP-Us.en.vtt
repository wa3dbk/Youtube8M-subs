the most important step is discussed in

the most important step is discussed in
the<00:02:54.630> beginning<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.380> take<00:02:55.560> your<00:02:55.770> time<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
the beginning is to take your time and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.820 
the beginning is to take your time and
put<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.030> right<00:02:57.180> amount<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.570> water<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.320> get

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
put the right amount of water on and get

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.280 
put the right amount of water on and get
the<00:02:58.950> right<00:02:59.160> feel<00:02:59.550> it's<00:03:00.480> really<00:03:00.810> important<00:03:01.260> to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
the right feel it's really important to

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
the right feel it's really important to
give<00:03:01.530> yourself<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:02.130> little<00:03:02.160> bit<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.550> time<00:03:02.730> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
give yourself a little bit of time to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.500 
give yourself a little bit of time to
learn<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.410> nuances<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.490> lot<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.970> water<00:03:06.120> or<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
learn the nuances of a lot of water or a

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.450 
learn the nuances of a lot of water or a
little<00:03:06.780> water<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.230> once<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.860> got<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.070> down

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
little water and once you got that down

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.760 
little water and once you got that down
depending<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.660> you're<00:03:09.840> doing<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:10.710> you're

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
depending on what you're doing if you're

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.350 
depending on what you're doing if you're
doing<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.310> long<00:03:11.580> soft<00:03:11.910> but<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> need

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
doing it like long soft but you need

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.970 
doing it like long soft but you need
more<00:03:12.540> time<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.050> probably<00:03:13.260> put<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> lot<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.710> water

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
more time I probably put a lot of water

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770 
more time I probably put a lot of water
on<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.760> you're<00:03:14.910> just<00:03:15.030> doing<00:03:15.180> some<00:03:15.450> windows

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
on it if you're just doing some windows

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.450 
on it if you're just doing some windows
I<00:03:15.930> probably<00:03:16.260> put<00:03:16.380> less<00:03:16.560> water<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.130> that's<00:03:17.280> up

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
I probably put less water but that's up

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.430 
I probably put less water but that's up
to<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.700> guys<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.660> learn<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.050> just<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
to you guys to to learn it's just to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.010 
to you guys to to learn it's just to
think<00:03:19.650> about<00:03:19.850> we<00:03:20.850> install<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:21.390> corner<00:03:21.780> five

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
think about we install this corner five

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.390 
think about we install this corner five
minutes<00:03:22.440> ago<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.890> actually<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.340> ahead

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
minutes ago you can actually go ahead

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.340 
minutes ago you can actually go ahead
and<00:03:23.490> coat<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.820> right<00:03:24.120> now<00:03:24.300> I'm<00:03:24.900> going<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.140> peel

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
and coat it right now I'm going to peel

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.370 
and coat it right now I'm going to peel
this<00:03:25.470> off<00:03:25.709> just<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:26.940> see<00:03:27.180> how<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:28.140> such

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
this off just so you can see how in such

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.770 
this off just so you can see how in such
a<00:03:28.410> short<00:03:28.740> time<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.550> adhesive<00:03:29.970> has<00:03:30.120> bonded<00:03:30.390> so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
a short time the adhesive has bonded so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720 
a short time the adhesive has bonded so
well<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> corner<00:03:31.800> it's<00:03:32.250> still<00:03:32.490> going<00:03:32.670> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
well to the corner it's still going to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.880 
well to the corner it's still going to
be<00:03:32.790> gooey<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.270> wet<00:03:33.480> back<00:03:33.720> there<00:03:34.020> but<00:03:34.680> it's

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
be gooey and wet back there but it's

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:45.330 
be gooey and wet back there but it's
good<00:03:35.459> enough<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:35.820> coat<00:03:36.060> here<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.810> go

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.040 

so<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.330> can<00:03:46.450> see<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.530> thing<00:03:47.800> completely

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
so as you can see this thing completely

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.770 
so as you can see this thing completely
