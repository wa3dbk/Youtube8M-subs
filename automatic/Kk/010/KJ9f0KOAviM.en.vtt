00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
this on which I put this on almost

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.460 
this on which I put this on almost
immediately<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.720> don't<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:23.080> if

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
immediately so I don't know if

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
immediately so I don't know if
eventually<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.790> dries<00:03:25.060> down<00:03:25.360> or<00:03:25.600> what<00:03:25.750> I

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
eventually it dries down or what I

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.870 
eventually it dries down or what I
haven't<00:03:26.200> waited<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.620> see<00:03:26.650> because<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.220> put<00:03:27.760> my

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
haven't waited to see because I put my

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.520 
haven't waited to see because I put my
concealer<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.390> both<00:03:28.630> my<00:03:28.810> eyes<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.170> then<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.320> put

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
concealer on both my eyes and then I put

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.820 
concealer on both my eyes and then I put
this<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.890> right<00:03:30.040> away<00:03:30.100> but<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.989> like<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> wet

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
this on right away but it is like a wet

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.979 
this on right away but it is like a wet
creamy<00:03:33.220> consistency<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.330> would<00:03:34.540> be<00:03:34.720> really

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
creamy consistency so it would be really

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.520 
creamy consistency so it would be really
good<00:03:35.380> for<00:03:36.390> anybody<00:03:37.390> that's<00:03:37.450> got<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.780> really<00:03:38.050> dry
