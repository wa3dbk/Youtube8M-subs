wool<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:39.319> obsidian<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.280> had<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.519> my

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
wool that is obsidian that I had in my

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.270 
wool that is obsidian that I had in my
chest<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.569> I<00:03:41.750> use<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.260> every<00:03:42.620> single<00:03:42.769> one

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
chest and I use like every single one

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.300 
chest and I use like every single one
except<00:03:43.670> two<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:44.989> had<00:03:45.200> 40<00:03:45.560> obsidian<00:03:45.950> by<00:03:46.130> use

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
except two so I had 40 obsidian by use

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.129 
except two so I had 40 obsidian by use
38<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:50.090> only<00:03:50.239> way<00:03:50.389> to<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.600> black<00:03:50.840> wool

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
38 so the only way to get black wool

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.319 
38 so the only way to get black wool
because<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.950> can't<00:03:52.190> get<00:03:52.340> insects<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:53.030> that

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
because you can't get insects is that

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.360 
because you can't get insects is that
you<00:03:53.810> have<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.650> black<00:03:54.980> sheet<00:03:55.250> that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
you have to have a black sheet that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.610 
you have to have a black sheet that
spawns<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.540> I'm<00:03:56.690> pretty<00:03:56.870> sure<00:03:57.079> I<00:03:57.139> had<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.350> black

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
spawns and I'm pretty sure I had a black

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.809 
spawns and I'm pretty sure I had a black
sheet<00:03:57.799> that<00:03:57.920> spawn<00:03:59.049> but<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.410> know<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.859> dyed<00:04:01.790> it

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
sheet that spawn but you know I dyed it

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.030 
sheet that spawn but you know I dyed it
because<00:04:02.569> I<00:04:02.690> didn't<00:04:02.989> know<00:04:03.109> that<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.680> couldn't

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
because I didn't know that you couldn't

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.309 
because I didn't know that you couldn't
get<00:04:04.190> clock<00:04:04.459> while<00:04:04.670> after<00:04:04.910> that<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.540> if<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.170> knew

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
get clock while after that so if I knew

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.550 
get clock while after that so if I knew
I<00:04:06.349> would<00:04:06.620> have<00:04:06.650> see<00:04:06.889> that<00:04:06.920> definitely<00:04:07.459> read<00:04:07.910> it

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
I would have see that definitely read it

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.780 
I would have see that definitely read it
so<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.620> could<00:04:09.769> get<00:04:09.859> more<00:04:10.010> black<00:04:10.310> sheet<00:04:10.579> but

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
so we could get more black sheet but

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.310 
so we could get more black sheet but
that's<00:04:11.000> wasn't<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.870> scenario<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:12.979> now<00:04:13.160> I'm

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
that's wasn't the scenario so now I'm

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.120 
that's wasn't the scenario so now I'm
watching<00:04:15.320> this

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
watching this

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.230 
watching this
basically<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:18.680> but<00:04:19.280> from<00:04:19.490> a<00:04:19.520> distance<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:20.060> can

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.240 
basically so but from a distance you can

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.000 
basically so but from a distance you can
until<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:20.630> bet<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.959> even<00:04:21.080> know<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.620> was<00:04:21.860> its
