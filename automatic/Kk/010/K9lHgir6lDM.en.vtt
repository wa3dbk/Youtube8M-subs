00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.579
 hello how about friends welcome to the ghost zone yosef anton 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.509
 and here I bring you a small entity how can tell the titan ochoa 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.859
 derna 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.689
 on the world map you know that this one just came out to playstation 3 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.609
 good slim 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.470
 all you have to do is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 stab some men who are leaving you 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.520
 they will leave topics 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.840
 from the water 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.520
 so you have to move pretty fast 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.340
 so that the front to 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.040
 go back there and they will also leave you from other places but 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.080
 They mainly come out of the water 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.330
 and good 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.190
 that's why you have to cut euros before that in the first alarm 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 why 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.970
 every time an alarm sounds 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.020
 these men are becoming much stronger 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 and they can not kill us with just the blades 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.030
 Now what you have to do is 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.680
 keep going around here on the shore you know this technique that the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.080
 known pattern 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.350
 the one in the little train here you will pigeon a grenade so that it goes back 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 and you can grab a lot more points with the men that's been doing 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.160
 and good here in this part quote 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.310
 pass 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.250
 cross as fast as you can 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.690
 forever 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.540
 try to keep the distance a little close to the men because if you 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 overtake too much you will come out ahead 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.970
 Take care that you do not touch 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.780
 twice because and as you already know you do not have 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 the titan and they can kill you 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.790
 so keep going around here 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 Keep going until you spend the pomegranates 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.780
 and well with Athens do not have grenades 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.430
 you can start to shoot month to see the men who follow you 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 with the gun 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.220
 so 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.650
 by cecilia cys as bella there are enough points to grab the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.250
 titan 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.459
 and now you can leave and continue the game 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.230
 percent if you want to follow it normally now that if you want 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.379
 stay for 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.309
 break up somebody recovered something 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.369
 then you can keep going around here 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.659
 fredys stopping with the gun i good 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.929
 hacienda saÃ­r the machine highlights punch 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.609
 who do 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.769
 manages to make the 800 points 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.439
 then fix this weapon 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.399
 and you'll have 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.929
 a much more powerful data for 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.169
 keep killing the zombies that are following you but as I say this 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:43.809
 guide is only for 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.449
 grab the titan enyeama 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:50.629
 So until now we have achieved what we have proposed 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.989
 and well I hope this guide serves you already 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.529
