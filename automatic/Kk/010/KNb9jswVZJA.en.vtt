00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:20.579 
that call you on the treadmill is the

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.700 
that call you on the treadmill is the
best<00:00:20.789> way<00:00:20.909> to<00:00:20.939> lose<00:00:21.150> fat<00:00:21.179> I<00:00:21.989> want<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> give<00:00:22.560> you

best way to lose fat I want to give you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.319 
best way to lose fat I want to give you
you<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.339> little<00:00:23.579> tentative<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.239> it

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
you know a little tentative and it

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.819 
you know a little tentative and it
usually<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.960> make<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> final<00:00:25.589> call<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
usually you make the final call the

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.519 
usually you make the final call the
number<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.279> reason<00:00:26.730> fat<00:00:27.089> burning<00:00:27.529> nothing

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
number one reason fat burning nothing

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.150 
number one reason fat burning nothing
and<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.039> repeat<00:00:29.069> nothing<00:00:30.349> burns<00:00:31.349> fat<00:00:31.769> like

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and I repeat nothing burns fat like

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
and I repeat nothing burns fat like
sprinting<00:00:32.669> even<00:00:32.940> sprinting<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.870> thing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
sprinting even sprinting for the thing

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.389 
sprinting even sprinting for the thing
while<00:00:34.230> sprinting<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> amount

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
while sprinting is it's not the amount

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.439 
while sprinting is it's not the amount
of<00:00:35.460> fat<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.850> burning<00:00:36.059> while<00:00:36.300> you're

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
of fat that you burning while you're

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.599 
of fat that you burning while you're
sprinting<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.769> after<00:00:38.039> Brian<00:00:38.219> effect<00:00:38.519> is

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
sprinting it's the after Brian effect is

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.009 
sprinting it's the after Brian effect is
the<00:00:38.730> amount<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> fat<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.329> body<00:00:39.359> continues<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
the amount of fat your body continues to

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.509 
the amount of fat your body continues to
burn<00:00:40.320> even<00:00:40.679> when<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:40.920> done<00:00:41.039> spreading

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
burn even when you're done spreading

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.650 
burn even when you're done spreading
suppose<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.269> do<00:00:42.359> it<00:00:42.480> consistently

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
suppose if you do it consistently

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.319 
suppose if you do it consistently
because<00:00:43.469> uh<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.730> signaling

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
because uh it's all about signaling

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.819 
because uh it's all about signaling
right<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.719> body<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:46.109> give<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> physique

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
right your body will give you a physique

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.579 
right your body will give you a physique
to<00:00:47.039> match<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.609> demand<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.000> put<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
to match the demand you put on it if you

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.489 
to match the demand you put on it if you
do<00:00:50.280> cardio<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> run<00:00:52.050> slowly<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
do cardio you run slowly on the

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.380 
do cardio you run slowly on the
treadmill<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.100> mean<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.820> nothing<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.179> want

can do cardio with a lot of fat on it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
can do cardio with a lot of fat on it
and<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> sprint<00:01:02.149> your<00:01:03.149> body's<00:01:03.480> gonna

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

and when you sprint your body's gonna
have<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.110> give<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.440> leaner<00:01:04.830> body<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.370> more

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
have to give you a leaner body a more

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.610 
have to give you a leaner body a more
muscular<00:01:06.000> body<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> need<00:01:07.020> power<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
muscular body because you need power and

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.620 
muscular body because you need power and
speed<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.460> order<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.730> sprint<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> can't

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
speed in order to sprint and you can't

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.260 
speed in order to sprint and you can't
it's<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.380> hard<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.620> be<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> power<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's very hard to be to a power and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.190 
it's very hard to be to a power and
speed<00:01:12.600> when<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> fat<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.490> sprint

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
speed when you fat you know to sprint

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
speed when you fat you know to sprint
now<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.980> your<00:01:17.130> body<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.340> always<00:01:17.610> adjust<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
now so your body will always adjust to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.750 
now so your body will always adjust to
the<00:01:18.480> demand<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.260> it<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:20.010> sprinting

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
the demand you put on it so sprinting

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.310 
the demand you put on it so sprinting
burns<00:01:21.180> fat<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.630> no<00:01:21.750> other<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.170> from

that's<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.099> seconds<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.610> third<00:04:48.849> reason

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
that's the seconds and the third reason

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.529 
that's the seconds and the third reason
is<00:04:49.740> obviously<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.949> is<00:04:51.069> very<00:04:51.460> very<00:04:52.030> short

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
is obviously it is very very short

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:53.879 
is obviously it is very very short
