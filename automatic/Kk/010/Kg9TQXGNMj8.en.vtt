00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
so I purchased this jointer from a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.280 
so I purchased this jointer from a
gentleman<00:00:08.059> an<00:00:09.059> old<00:00:09.269> Rockwell<00:00:11.030> orange<00:00:12.290> and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
gentleman an old Rockwell orange and

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.900 
gentleman an old Rockwell orange and
it's<00:00:14.210> belt-driven<00:00:15.210> half-inch<00:00:15.750> pee<00:00:15.960> belt<00:00:16.910> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's belt-driven half-inch pee belt and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.410 
it's belt-driven half-inch pee belt and
the<00:00:18.029> motor<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> mounted<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:18.990> plate<00:00:20.420> it's

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the motor is mounted to this plate it's

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.050 
the motor is mounted to this plate it's
on<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.650> set<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.769> hinges<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> weight<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
on a set of hinges so the weight of the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.800 
on a set of hinges so the weight of the
motor<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.199> holds<00:00:25.680> attention<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.359> this

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
motor is what holds attention and this

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:49.000 
motor is what holds attention and this
is<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.890> turn<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.250> on

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.740 

vibrates<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.340> badly<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.390> heard<00:00:51.660> about

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
vibrates really badly so I heard about

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680 
vibrates really badly so I heard about
these<00:00:52.050> link<00:00:52.320> belts<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.090> thought<00:00:54.390> I'd<00:00:54.540> give

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
these link belts and I thought I'd give

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
these link belts and I thought I'd give
them<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> try<00:00:55.050> I'll<00:00:55.290> put<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.650> on<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.070> we'll<00:00:56.879> try

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
them a try I'll put one on and we'll try

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.780 
them a try I'll put one on and we'll try
it<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.510> again<00:00:57.840> okay<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.309> got<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.610> v-belt

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
it out again okay so we got the v-belt

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.430 
it out again okay so we got the v-belt
installed<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.510> our<00:01:03.510> excuse<00:01:03.930> me<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> link

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
installed and our excuse me the link

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.740 
installed and our excuse me the link
belt<00:01:05.330> yeah<00:01:06.530> take<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> quick<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:08.009> underneath

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.149 

so<00:01:12.750> nothing<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.650> changed<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:17.070> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so nothing down here is changed then I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
so nothing down here is changed then I
went<00:01:17.340> ahead<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.700> took<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:20.960> however

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
went ahead and just took out however

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.389 
went ahead and just took out however
many<00:01:22.110> links<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> needed<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> make<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
many links I needed to to make it the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.290 
many links I needed to to make it the
same<00:01:23.610> length<00:01:24.229> just<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.700> take<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> pack

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
same length just to take out that pack

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.999 
same length just to take out that pack
room<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.630> maybe<00:01:27.840> maybe<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.619> motor

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
room you know maybe maybe the motor

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.580 
room you know maybe maybe the motor
hanging<00:01:29.399> down<00:01:29.550> loader<00:01:30.140> would<00:01:31.140> put<00:01:31.440> more

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
hanging down loader would put more

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.010 
hanging down loader would put more
tension<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.539> out<00:01:33.690> some<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
tension on it and take out some of the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.630 
tension on it and take out some of the
vibrations<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.649> I<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.920> wanted<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.460> if

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
vibrations so I just wanted to see if

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.190 
vibrations so I just wanted to see if
you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.210> make<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.840> same<00:01:36.990> like

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you know just make about the same like

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800 
you know just make about the same like
so<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:37.440> can<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.800> out<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.700> isolate<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so I can take out this isolate just the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.850 
so I can take out this isolate just the
type<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> L<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.970> if<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.179> makes<00:01:42.420> sense

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
type of L you know if that makes sense

00:01:42.860 --> 00:02:14.640 
type of L you know if that makes sense
all<00:01:43.860> right

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.740 

much<00:02:15.650> quieter<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:17.300> way<00:02:17.900> less<00:02:18.260> vibration<00:02:20.740> nice
