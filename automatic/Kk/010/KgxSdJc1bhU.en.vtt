nice<00:00:45.329> crop<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.739> now<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
nice crop off of it but now we want to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
nice crop off of it but now we want to
kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.640> bring<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.059> into<00:00:48.270> balance<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
kind of bring it back into balance a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.400 
kind of bring it back into balance a
little<00:00:48.960> bit

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
little bit

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
little bit
we<00:00:49.950> did<00:00:50.219> some<00:00:50.520> pruning<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.239> early<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
we did some pruning on it early in the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.000 
we did some pruning on it early in the
season<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> keep

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
season but just to kind of keep

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.619 
season but just to kind of keep
everything<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.610> bounds<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.449> see

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
everything in bounds but now you can see

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.950 
everything in bounds but now you can see
it's<00:00:54.750> grown<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.170> 6<00:00:55.559> feet<00:00:55.800> 7<00:00:56.100> feet<00:00:56.629> since<00:00:57.629> early

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's grown out 6 feet 7 feet since early

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
it's grown out 6 feet 7 feet since early
in<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.199> season<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.520> first<00:00:59.789> thing<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> want

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
in this season so the first thing I want

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.049 
in this season so the first thing I want
to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.840> walk<00:01:01.710> around<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.219> exterior<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to do is walk around the exterior and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.399 
to do is walk around the exterior and
I'm<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> look<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:03.930> things<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I'm just going to look for things that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.990 
I'm just going to look for things that
are<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.920> balance<00:01:05.339> or<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:05.970> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
are out of balance or kind of out of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300 
are out of balance or kind of out of
place<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.659> here's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> branch<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
place so here's a branch that's kind of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
place so here's a branch that's kind of
growing<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> balance<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.049> we

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
growing you know out of balance so we

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.100 
growing you know out of balance so we
can<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> come<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
can take that off I can do come back and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.770 
can take that off I can do come back and
take<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.979> edges<00:01:14.640> back<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
take the edges back in a little bit I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 
take the edges back in a little bit I
can<00:01:16.409> look<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.740> some<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.070> long<00:01:17.659> lanky

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
can look for some of this long lanky

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.740 
can look for some of this long lanky
vigor<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:20.180> as<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.479> move

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
vigor and I can take that out as I move

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.410 
vigor and I can take that out as I move
my<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:22.110> around<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.590> tree<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.159> don't<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
my way around the tree I don't have to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
my way around the tree I don't have to
touch<00:01:24.600> every<00:01:24.840> branch<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> make

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
touch every branch I don't have to make

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.859 
touch every branch I don't have to make
a<00:01:26.040> cut<00:01:26.400> everywhere<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.390> looking

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
a cut everywhere I go I'm just looking

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.380 
a cut everywhere I go I'm just looking
for<00:01:28.049> things<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:30.150> balance

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
for things that I think would balance

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
for things that I think would balance
out<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.930> tree<00:01:31.229> better<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.979> combination

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
out this tree better or this combination

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
out this tree better or this combination
better<00:01:32.909> since<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.439> three

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
better since there are actually three

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.499 
better since there are actually three
plants<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> combination<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.360> going

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
plants in the combination and I'm going

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
plants in the combination and I'm going
to<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.079> steps<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.070> try

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to do this in steps I'm not going to try

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.910 
to do this in steps I'm not going to try
and<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.509> top<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> sides<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> same

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and do the top and the sides at the same

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
and do the top and the sides at the same
time<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> work<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.909> way<00:01:41.939> around<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
time I'm going to work my way around and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
time I'm going to work my way around and
do<00:01:42.720> everything<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> outside<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.100> then

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
do everything on the outside and then

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.649 
do everything on the outside and then
I'm<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> come<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I'm going to come back and I'm going to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
I'm going to come back and I'm going to
look<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> top<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.280> looks<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.579> I'm

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
look at the top so it looks like I'm

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
look at the top so it looks like I'm
missing<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.299> lot<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.810> am<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.500> think<00:01:49.920> it's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
missing a lot and I am but I think it's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
missing a lot and I am but I think it's
important<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.390> stage<00:01:51.659> some<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
important to kind of stage some of these

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.980 
important to kind of stage some of these
jobs<00:01:52.680> into<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.250> than<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.610> function<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.299> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
jobs into more than one function so to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
jobs into more than one function so to
work<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.530> around<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.920> combination

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
work your way around the combination

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
work your way around the combination
maybe<00:01:57.210> work<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> center<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> combination

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
maybe work the center of the combination

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
maybe work the center of the combination
a<00:01:58.770> little<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.430> work<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> top<00:01:59.969> makes

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
a little bit and then work the top makes

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.870 
a little bit and then work the top makes
a<00:02:00.810> big<00:02:00.990> difference<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.530> how<00:02:01.649> everything<00:02:02.640> comes

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
a big difference in how everything comes

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.370 
a big difference in how everything comes
into<00:02:03.060> place<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.540> you're<00:02:03.659> concentrating<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
into place if you're concentrating on

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.780 
into place if you're concentrating on
one<00:02:04.590> thing<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> time<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.310> makes<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.640> lot

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
one thing at a time it makes it a lot

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
one thing at a time it makes it a lot
easier<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.420> we'll<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.770> we'll<00:02:07.890> just

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
easier so we'll just do that we'll just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
easier so we'll just do that we'll just
walked<00:02:08.250> around<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> outside<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.090> remember

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
walked around the outside and remember

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.960 
walked around the outside and remember
it's<00:02:09.989> only<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.470> first<00:02:10.679> week<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.009> July<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it's only the first week in July so I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.970 
it's only the first week in July so I
have

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
have

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.430 
have
July<00:02:13.610> August<00:02:13.849> September<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:15.050> even<00:02:15.230> into

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
July August September and even into

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.289 
July August September and even into
early<00:02:15.500> October<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.550> regrowth<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.209> I'm

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
early October to get regrowth so I'm

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.850 
early October to get regrowth so I'm
going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.659> a<00:02:17.690> lot<00:02:18.049> more<00:02:18.080> establishment

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
going to get a lot more establishment

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.649 
going to get a lot more establishment
before<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.400> end<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:19.670> summer<00:02:19.849> I'll<00:02:20.269> probably

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
before the end of summer I'll probably

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.259 
before the end of summer I'll probably
have<00:02:21.080> another<00:02:21.340> three<00:02:22.340> or<00:02:22.370> four<00:02:22.489> feet<00:02:22.909> worth<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
have another three or four feet worth of

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.449 
have another three or four feet worth of
growth<00:02:23.480> off<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.590> lot<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:24.890> these<00:02:24.980> cuts<00:02:25.250> by<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
growth off of a lot of these cuts by the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.280 
growth off of a lot of these cuts by the
end<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.790> summer<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.269> always<00:02:26.540> take<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.110> into

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
end of summer so always take that into

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.970 
end of summer so always take that into
consideration

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
consideration

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.229 
consideration
don't<00:02:28.220> cut<00:02:28.459> where<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.640> want<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> be

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
don't cut where you want it to be

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.479 
don't cut where you want it to be
ultimately<00:02:29.690> cut<00:02:30.349> back<00:02:30.590> beyond<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.370> that

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
ultimately cut back beyond that so that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.460 
ultimately cut back beyond that so that
you<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.640> grow<00:02:32.030> out<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.989> point<00:02:33.230> where<00:02:33.379> you

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
you can grow out to the point where you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:49.900 
you can grow out to the point where you
want<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.830> establish<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.700> west

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
want it to establish this is on the west

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.940 
want it to establish this is on the west
side<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.510> gets<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.870> lot<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.109> afternoon<00:02:51.709> hot

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
side which gets a lot of afternoon hot

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.289 
side which gets a lot of afternoon hot
sun<00:02:52.220> exposure<00:02:52.579> I'm<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.879> to<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> little

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
sun exposure I'm going to be a little

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.660 
sun exposure I'm going to be a little
bit<00:02:53.450> more<00:02:54.069> aggressive<00:02:55.069> here<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.459> try<00:02:55.640> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
bit more aggressive here and try and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.770 
bit more aggressive here and try and
keep<00:02:55.849> this<00:02:56.090> open<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.410> little<00:02:57.560> bit<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:59.450> west

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
keep this open a little bit on this west

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.960 
keep this open a little bit on this west
side<00:03:04.720> I've<00:03:05.720> had<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> lot<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.290> people<00:03:06.879> comment<00:03:07.879> on

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
side I've had a lot of people comment on

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.640 
side I've had a lot of people comment on
some<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.390> videos<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:09.049> doing<00:03:09.230> saying

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
some of the videos that I'm doing saying

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.220 
some of the videos that I'm doing saying
I'm<00:03:09.859> not<00:03:10.069> showing<00:03:11.030> them<00:03:11.269> enough<00:03:11.510> detail<00:03:11.959> I'm

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
I'm not showing them enough detail I'm

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.099 
I'm not showing them enough detail I'm
not<00:03:13.000> spending<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.329> know<00:03:14.359> enough<00:03:14.840> time

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
not spending you know enough time

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.839 
not spending you know enough time
showing<00:03:15.590> where<00:03:15.829> I'm<00:03:15.980> making<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.370> cut<00:03:16.579> or<00:03:16.700> why

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
showing where I'm making a cut or why

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.390 
showing where I'm making a cut or why
I'm<00:03:16.910> making<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.389> cut<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.590> know<00:03:18.709> I'll<00:03:19.069> explain

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
I'm making a cut and I know I'll explain

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.190 
I'm making a cut and I know I'll explain
that<00:03:19.639> because<00:03:20.299> it's<00:03:20.630> not<00:03:20.810> really<00:03:21.169> that

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
that because it's not really that

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.860 
that because it's not really that
important<00:03:21.859> what<00:03:22.639> what<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.120> most<00:03:23.329> important

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
important what what the most important

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.530 
important what what the most important
concept<00:03:24.349> here<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.739> get<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.579> tree<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.090> balance

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
concept here is get the tree in balance

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.210 
concept here is get the tree in balance
the<00:03:26.930> tree<00:03:27.200> has<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:27.620> balanced<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the tree has to be balanced the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.740

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
real tasty so now that I've worked my

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.470 
real tasty so now that I've worked my
way<00:04:38.340> around<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.700> outside<00:04:40.150> one<00:04:40.480> time<00:04:42.330> let's<00:04:43.330> go

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
way around the outside one time let's go

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.810 
way around the outside one time let's go
back<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:43.900> look<00:04:44.020> up<00:04:44.170> a<00:04:44.290> little<00:04:44.320> higher<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:45.100> my

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
back and look up a little higher so my

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.760 
back and look up a little higher so my
ultimate<00:04:46.030> size<00:04:46.540> here<00:04:46.900> again<00:04:47.170> I<00:04:47.200> want<00:04:47.500> this<00:04:47.620> to

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
ultimate size here again I want this to

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.350 
ultimate size here again I want this to
be<00:04:47.890> about<00:04:48.010> maybe<00:04:48.400> seven<00:04:48.880> seven<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.330> half

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
be about maybe seven seven and a half

be about maybe seven seven and a half
feet<00:04:49.720> high<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.830> can<00:04:50.920> come<00:04:51.190> back<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.550> now<00:04:51.580> and

feet high so I can come back in now and

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.390 
feet high so I can come back in now and
just<00:04:52.000> start<00:04:52.210> working<00:04:52.920> some<00:04:53.920> of<00:04:54.040> these<00:04:54.130> tips

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400
