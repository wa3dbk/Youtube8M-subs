00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
need to do is make sure that an the rum

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.240 
need to do is make sure that an the rum
you<00:00:32.020> get<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.290> compatible<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.130> your

try to install a non ECC module okay and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.749 
try to install a non ECC module okay and
also<00:02:04.200> remember<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.229> while<00:02:05.829> rom<00:02:06.159> does<00:02:06.459> boost

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
also remember that while rom does boost

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.059 
also remember that while rom does boost
performance<00:02:06.999> because<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.470> more<00:02:08.649> i<00:02:08.770> may<00:02:08.830> have

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
performance because the more i may have

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.749 
performance because the more i may have
a<00:02:09.130> more<00:02:09.340> dead<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.909> can<00:02:10.060> handle<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.420> anyway

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
a more dead you can handle it anyway

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.449 
a more dead you can handle it anyway
moment<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.239> time<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.680> also<00:02:13.040> remember

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
moment in time and you also remember

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.170 
moment in time and you also remember
that<00:02:13.879> your<00:02:14.360> graphics<00:02:14.810> card<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.829> your

that your graphics card and your

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.929 
that your graphics card and your

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
processor they are both I am just as

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.089 
processor they are both I am just as
important<00:02:20.450> because<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:21.319> could<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.709> very

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
important because you could have a very

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.059 
important because you could have a very
fast<00:02:22.370> process<00:02:22.579> and<00:02:23.239> eight<00:02:23.659> gigs<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.140> ram<00:02:24.379> but

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
fast process and eight gigs of ram but

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.920 
fast process and eight gigs of ram but
if<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.430> don't<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> graphics<00:02:26.239> card<00:02:26.329> or<00:02:26.720> at

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
if you don't have a graphics card or at

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.600 
if you don't have a graphics card or at
least<00:02:27.079> a<00:02:27.170> very<00:02:27.290> good<00:02:27.530> graphics<00:02:27.890> card<00:02:28.190> then<00:02:28.519> you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
least a very good graphics card then you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.580 
least a very good graphics card then you
might<00:02:28.760> win<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.030> better<00:02:29.239> run<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.659> game<00:02:29.690> but

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
might win you better run your game but

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.250 
might win you better run your game but
if<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.890> game<00:02:31.069> has<00:02:31.599> detail<00:02:32.599> or<00:02:32.840> advanced

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
if a game has detail or advanced

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.920 
if a game has detail or advanced
graphics<00:02:33.769> anyway<00:02:34.129> or<00:02:34.400> if<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.180> lot<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
graphics anyway or if you have a lot of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.530 
graphics anyway or if you have a lot of
RAM<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.310> good<00:02:37.459> graphics<00:02:37.819> card<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.450> your

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
RAM then a good graphics card or your

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.530 
RAM then a good graphics card or your
processor<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.349> very<00:02:39.560> slow<00:02:39.920> then<00:02:40.909> it's<00:02:41.390> going

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
processor is very slow then it's going

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.849 
processor is very slow then it's going
to<00:02:41.599> run<00:02:41.780> where<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.140> going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.439> pretty

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
to run where it's going to be pretty

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.649 
to run where it's going to be pretty
slow<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:43.640> not<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:43.970> run<00:02:44.120> quickly<00:02:44.359> off

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
slow it's not going to run quickly off

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.039 
slow it's not going to run quickly off
smoothly<00:02:45.250> okay<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.310> remember<00:02:46.900> when<00:02:47.900> you're

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
smoothly okay so remember when you're

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.740 
smoothly okay so remember when you're
building<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.470> pc<00:02:48.680> or<00:02:49.090> upgrade<00:02:50.090> remember<00:02:50.599> that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
building a pc or upgrade remember that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.770 
building a pc or upgrade remember that
every<00:02:51.109> component<00:02:51.500> counts<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.220> don't<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.629> you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
every component counts and don't if you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.599 
every component counts and don't if you
have<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> very<00:02:54.139> slow<00:02:54.409> process<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.190> bad<00:02:55.370> video

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
have a very slow process and a bad video

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.460 
have a very slow process and a bad video
card<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.540> don't<00:02:56.750> think<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.079> because<00:02:57.440> you

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
card and don't think that because you

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.009 
card and don't think that because you
install<00:02:57.980> extra<00:02:58.250> four<00:02:58.579> gigs<00:02:58.849> of<00:02:59.030> ram<00:02:59.269> your

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
install extra four gigs of ram your

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.300 
install extra four gigs of ram your
computer<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.530> going<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.799> go<00:03:00.859> a<00:03:00.889> lot<00:03:01.099> faster

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
computer is going to go a lot faster

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.420 
computer is going to go a lot faster
because<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.450> limited<00:03:02.930> by<00:03:03.109> how<00:03:03.620> fast<00:03:03.889> and<00:03:04.400> how

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
because it's limited by how fast and how

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.319 
because it's limited by how fast and how
powerful<00:03:05.269> your<00:03:05.359> processor<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.220> ok<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.180> just

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
powerful your processor is ok so just

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.420 
powerful your processor is ok so just
keep<00:03:08.629> that<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.870> mind<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:10.010> I'm<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:10.400> to

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
keep that in mind and I'm going to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.460 
keep that in mind and I'm going to
install<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.970> now<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.599> first<00:03:11.900> off<00:03:12.139> I'm<00:03:12.319> going

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
install it now but first off I'm going

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.500 
install it now but first off I'm going
to<00:03:12.560> touch<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.889> metal<00:03:13.099> chassis<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:13.940> fam

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
to touch the metal chassis of the fam

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.740 
to touch the metal chassis of the fam
machine<00:03:15.579> just<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.699> discharge<00:03:17.449> any<00:03:17.660> static

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
machine just to discharge any static

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.580 
machine just to discharge any static
from<00:03:18.319> my<00:03:18.470> body<00:03:18.650> ok<00:03:19.099> because<00:03:20.230> even<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.290> tiny

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
from my body ok because even a tiny

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.360 
from my body ok because even a tiny
amount<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:22.099> static<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:23.299> completely

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
amount of static can completely

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.710 
amount of static can completely
short-circuit<00:03:25.370> your<00:03:25.970> motherboard<00:03:26.449> and<00:03:26.599> then

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
short-circuit your motherboard and then

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.990 
short-circuit your motherboard and then
you<00:03:26.840> can<00:03:26.959> have<00:03:27.109> some<00:03:27.260> serious<00:03:27.530> problems<00:03:27.590> ok<00:03:28.250> so

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
you can have some serious problems ok so

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.990 
you can have some serious problems ok so
when<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:31.040> can't<00:03:31.310> get<00:03:31.459> an<00:03:31.579> anti-static

when you can't get an anti-static
wristband<00:03:32.569> but<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.989> be<00:03:33.079> honest<00:03:33.349> you<00:03:33.470> don't

applying<00:04:12.409> law<00:04:12.680> enforcement<00:04:13.280> isn't<00:04:13.400> going<00:04:13.609> in

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
applying law enforcement isn't going in

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.789 
applying law enforcement isn't going in
a<00:04:13.970> lot<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.780> forcing<00:04:15.139> it<00:04:15.229> isn't<00:04:15.409> going<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.620> man

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
a lot of forcing it isn't going to man

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.129 
a lot of forcing it isn't going to man
I'm<00:04:16.239> make<00:04:17.239> sure<00:04:17.389> you<00:04:17.570> have<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.720> great<00:04:17.989> way

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
I'm make sure you have a great way

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:18.860 
I'm make sure you have a great way
around<00:04:18.440> because

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
around because

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.140 
around because
one<00:04:19.709> side<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.959> smaller<00:04:21.959> than<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.350> other<00:04:22.380> okay

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
one side is smaller than the other okay

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.240 
one side is smaller than the other okay
so<00:04:24.150> we<00:04:24.810> can't<00:04:25.080> hold<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.320> lot<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.100> don't

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
so we can't hold a lot so you don't

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:36.800 
so we can't hold a lot so you don't
break<00:04:26.970> anything<00:04:31.340> just<00:04:32.389> push<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.419> in<00:04:35.419> until<00:04:36.419> you

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
break anything just push it in until you

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.689 
break anything just push it in until you
hear<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.110> snuff<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.590> see<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.040> pins<00:04:38.250> come<00:04:38.490> down

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
hear of snuff and see the pins come down
