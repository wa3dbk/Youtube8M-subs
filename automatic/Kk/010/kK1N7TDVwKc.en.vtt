 I was horrified by starting to change so many 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.740
 patrols frightened me today and then I said

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.900
 tomorrow that although you still do not know 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.670
 official causes for the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.640
 construction would come down them 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.080

 but so that happened with the structure 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.290
 it was bent and made to bend the rods 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.810
 of bending not the towers or the planting 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.910
