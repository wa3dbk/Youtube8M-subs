resurgence<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> 70s<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
resurgence of the 70s and this look I

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
resurgence of the 70s and this look I
think<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> typical<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.510> something<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.649> know

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
think is typical of something you know

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.430 
think is typical of something you know
someone<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.579> worn<00:00:44.850> back<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
someone would have worn back then so I

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.400

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
about that so he changed his mind and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.020 
about that so he changed his mind and
that's<00:02:38.590> good<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> he<00:02:39.160> admits<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.519> his<00:02:39.670> faults

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that's good that he admits to his faults

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.140 
that's good that he admits to his faults
so<00:02:40.840> anyway<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.890> sweater<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.400> think<00:02:42.819> it's<00:02:43.030> a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
so anyway this sweater I think it's a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900 
so anyway this sweater I think it's a
nice<00:02:43.299> cream<00:02:43.720> color<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:44.769> cropped<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.819> it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
nice cream color and it's cropped so it

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.610 
nice cream color and it's cropped so it
goes<00:02:46.060> really<00:02:46.299> well<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.630> these<00:02:46.870> high-waisted

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
goes really well with these high-waisted

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.610 
goes really well with these high-waisted
flare<00:02:48.100> jeans<00:02:48.579> which<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.970> like<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.290> has

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
flare jeans which I like and it just has

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.819 
flare jeans which I like and it just has
that<00:02:50.920> nice<00:02:51.250> creamy<00:02:51.670> hue<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.840> really<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.620> think

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
that nice creamy hue that really I think

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.150 
that nice creamy hue that really I think
was<00:02:54.660> evident<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> 70s<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.739> saying<00:02:57.040> with

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
was evident in the 70s and saying with

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.860 
was evident in the 70s and saying with
this<00:02:57.310> jean<00:02:57.519> color<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> really<00:02:58.660> nice

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
this jean color it's a really nice

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.840 
this jean color it's a really nice
combination<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.070> two<00:03:00.250> colors<00:03:00.609> together

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
combination of the two colors together

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.240 
combination of the two colors together
so<00:03:01.269> then<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> finished<00:03:02.709> off<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> look<00:03:03.190> with

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so then I finished off the look with

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.970 
so then I finished off the look with
some<00:03:03.609> fringe<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.450> course<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.140> can't<00:03:05.470> go<00:03:05.680> without

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
some fringe of course I can't go without

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.699 
some fringe of course I can't go without
fringe<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.540> bag<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.290> think<00:03:08.350> was

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
fringe and this bag I think was

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.640 
fringe and this bag I think was
definitely<00:03:09.340> Native<00:03:10.150> American<00:03:10.660> inspired<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
definitely Native American inspired and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.770 
definitely Native American inspired and
it<00:03:11.950> features<00:03:12.340> feathers<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.030> fringe<00:03:13.359> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
it features feathers and fringe and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.080 
it features feathers and fringe and
brown<00:03:14.590> suede<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.340> I'm<00:03:15.459> sure<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.880> way

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
brown suede and I'm sure it's way

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.300 
brown suede and I'm sure it's way
overpriced<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:17.170> know<00:03:17.290> for<00:03:17.560> what<00:03:17.739> what<00:03:18.220> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
overpriced you know for what what it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.160 
overpriced you know for what what it
would<00:03:18.459> take<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.670> make<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.450> love<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.989> bag

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
would take to make it but I love the bag

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.740 
would take to make it but I love the bag
I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.859> it's<00:03:21.069> really<00:03:21.250> nice<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.000> straps

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
I think it's really nice and the straps

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
I think it's really nice and the straps
extra<00:03:23.290> long<00:03:23.500> which<00:03:24.010> means<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.609> can<00:03:24.760> wear<00:03:24.850> it

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
extra long which means you can wear it

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.660 
extra long which means you can wear it
