00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
we showed you in a recent car Tech 101

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.059 
we showed you in a recent car Tech 101
that<00:02:02.119> still<00:02:02.450> just<00:02:02.840> handled<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.229> steering<00:02:03.679> but

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
that still just handled the steering but

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.520 
that still just handled the steering but
now<00:02:04.310> did<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.700> really<00:02:04.849> quickly<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.360> well<00:02:05.689> the

2015 Ford Focus will also do this trick
for<00:02:09.200> perpendicular<00:02:09.610> spaces<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.759> will<00:02:11.150> be

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
for perpendicular spaces and will be

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.210 
for perpendicular spaces and will be
able<00:02:11.329> to<00:02:11.510> automatically<00:02:12.290> exit<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.890> parking
