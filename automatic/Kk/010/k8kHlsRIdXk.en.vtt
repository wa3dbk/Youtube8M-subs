00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.540 

you<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:50.050> it's<00:02:50.170> not<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.380> clear<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.280> my

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
you know it's not that clear to see my

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.450 
you know it's not that clear to see my
hands<00:02:51.910> are<00:02:52.680> better<00:02:53.680> than<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.160> toy<00:02:56.460> this

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
hands are better than the toy this

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.560 
hands are better than the toy this
really<00:02:58.030> isn't<00:02:58.300> easy<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.870> do<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.970> don't<00:03:00.970> expect<00:03:01.450> a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
really isn't easy to do I don't expect a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.460 
really isn't easy to do I don't expect a
five-year-old<00:03:02.080> could<00:03:02.410> do<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:05.230> might<00:03:05.290> be

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
five-year-old could do it it might be

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:17.220 
five-year-old could do it it might be
able<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.220> little<00:03:06.730> more<00:03:06.850> unit<00:03:11.520> who<00:03:16.230> I'm

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
able to a little more unit who I'm

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.809 
able to a little more unit who I'm
guessing<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.980> it

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.220 

it<00:03:26.629> looks<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.959> lot<00:03:27.109> like<00:03:28.540> Charlie<00:03:29.540> did<00:03:29.719> it<00:03:29.840> right

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.259 

okay<00:03:33.230> all<00:03:33.379> right<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:34.370> has<00:03:34.549> these<00:03:34.730> ugly<00:03:35.120> little

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
okay all right it has these ugly little

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.209 
okay all right it has these ugly little
things<00:03:35.689> right<00:03:35.870> here<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:39.829> looks<00:03:39.980> really

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:40.219 
things right here it looks really

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:46.030 
things right here it looks really
unstirred<00:03:40.909> e<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:44.090> if<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.620> try<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.709> push<00:03:45.889> it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
unstirred e and if you try and push it

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.190 
unstirred e and if you try and push it
together<00:03:46.159> a<00:03:46.400> little<00:03:46.489> more<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.200> comes

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
together a little more it just comes

00:03:48.200 --> 00:04:01.890 
together a little more it just comes
apart<00:03:53.379> not<00:03:54.379> really<00:03:54.829> worth<00:03:54.980> five<00:03:55.280> dollars

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.810 

definitely<00:04:02.900> not<00:04:03.080> worth<00:04:03.320> five<00:04:03.650> dollars<00:04:06.820> the

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
definitely not worth five dollars the

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.310 
definitely not worth five dollars the
pieces<00:04:08.240> should<00:04:08.450> pop<00:04:08.690> back<00:04:08.960> on<00:04:08.990> pretty<00:04:09.530> easily

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
pieces should pop back on pretty easily

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.650 
pieces should pop back on pretty easily
because<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.470> just<00:04:12.650> have<00:04:12.800> these<00:04:12.980> little

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
because I just have these little

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.979 
because I just have these little
clippies

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.550 

not<00:04:21.709> an<00:04:21.919> easy<00:04:22.069> thing<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.550> play<00:04:22.759> with<00:04:23.380> not<00:04:24.380> an

get a better at least transformer toy

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.800 
get a better at least transformer toy
they<00:04:40.069> have<00:04:40.250> other<00:04:40.400> ones<00:04:40.699> probably<00:04:41.300> about<00:04:41.539> ten

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
they have other ones probably about ten

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.339 
they have other ones probably about ten
dollars<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:43.449> they're<00:04:44.449> a<00:04:44.479> lot<00:04:44.569> larger<00:04:44.840> scale

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
dollars and they're a lot larger scale

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.950 
dollars and they're a lot larger scale
which<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.430> think<00:04:46.699> makes<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.180> easier<00:04:47.599> to<00:04:47.630> put

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
which I think makes it easier to put

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.390 
which I think makes it easier to put
together<00:04:48.580> they<00:04:49.580> don't<00:04:49.759> look<00:04:49.940> as<00:04:50.120> ugly<00:04:51.400> but

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
together they don't look as ugly but

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:05.300 
together they don't look as ugly but
this<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.759> your<00:04:52.880> five<00:04:53.120> dollar<00:04:53.330> transformer

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310
