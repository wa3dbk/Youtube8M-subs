00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.780
 it may be one of the disciplines 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.340
 equestrian the least known yet their 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 this bowl is probably one of the most 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 and one of the most spectacular 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 on the occasion of the opening of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.540
 belgium championship in ghlin focus 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 so on this sport that asks the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.980
 riders an advanced world level 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.960
 then the qualities to be a good 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.550
 horse ball player mass and already the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 equestrian level which is very important 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.460
 necessarily because you have to have a good 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.470
 level and crate to be able to lead 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.520
 his horse and train him also because 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.620
 that often the hair is not put 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 to the world ball after that is having a 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.060
 little ball touch as they say 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's having the feeling of the game it's a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 collective sport so have them find 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.550
 spaces for for the aisles at 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.410
 goal to find the teammates demarked 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.910
 it's really a game vision and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.680
 after defensively it's envied 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.640
 naÃ¯ve as we say the niaque is the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.590
 term 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.180
 of rugby but it's really this 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.580
 what was really envied about the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.930
 field and once a level at the three 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.369
 gaits therefore not trot canter 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 without hands because it takes 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.659
 take care of the balloon not cereal dad 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.369
 for example and you must not have too much 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.990
 you have to be a bit sporty 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 flexible and then we go when when we 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.110
 starts at age 12 when we take them and we 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.390
 liked them generally they like 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.729
 well they try to see but 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.350
 the boatman does not make all his horse 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.420
 it is also of paramount importance 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.830
 it's very physical then for the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.360
 Ben horses at the endurance level 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.979
 since we are asking them a lot 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 for 20 minutes of galloping 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.550
 to start again is also 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.869
 a lot in the mind of the horse who 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.280
 is very important since the horse 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.860
 must be asked we must know 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.850
 set up easily 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.140
 and at the level of the mas players and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.950
 endurance also one since it takes 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.690
 get 20 minutes 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.100
 also know to have a little flexibility 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.200
 pickups is something when 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.030
 even complicated so if we do not have a 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.230
 little flexibility and after bah it's 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.060
 also training what to do 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.739
 to really train is a shame because 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 once a week in a workout 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.239
 by teams to precisely develop 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.800
 his abilities at the handballistic level 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.320
 really a big job of training 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.489
 business for that but that within range of 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.959
 any horse close what they 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.890
 do anyway to have fun a little 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.420
 little you still need a choice that 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.709
 ahead we can start very well with 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.450
 his flagship game the silk or a horse 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.530
 obstacle for example on training a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.450
 not really important 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.950
 but if you want to go to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.840
 higher divisions the costs really 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.910
 have a horse that is dynamic that 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.620
 push kiki who love the speed that 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.840
 loves the game and then we start in the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.880
 horses is usually old 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.930
 reforms and race and there must be 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.930
 it really grows 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.780
 side set their bowl rests on a 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.159
 pretty simple principle it's not for 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.640
 as much as we can do anything 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.590
 what 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.489
 the basic principle is to make three 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.560
 passes with three different players 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.360
 so we play at 4-4 counts 400 pitches 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.370
 with two substitutes so we will do 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.689
 three passes and we can start from 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.610
 that moment we can take a role 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.130
 we start a little bit about tactics of 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.150
 rugby basketball and some things 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.380
 because average of women is a 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.810
 spend in place must know how to play 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.040
 defenders and hence from there we put 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.790
 tactics in place to be able to try 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.140
 to play a bad maximum if physical but 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.660
 it stays in the rules it's not a 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.340
 sport and elbows are not 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.710
 allowed it's a bit of a mix of 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.970
 rugby and basketball so shoulder shoulder shoulder 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.440
 against horse shoulder and rider tolerate 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.570
 it's not obvious that's why there is 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.510
 a referee riding a chair umpire 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.720
 of a myth of chairs and in early contact 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.400
 who with his referee on horseback and that's 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.520
 a vision of the game that needs to be 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.950
 actually very rigorous for 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.250
 sanction the mistakes that are made 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.250
 by the players 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.879
 so not no 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.190
 there is a big priority principle so 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.139
 attacking it gives the meaning of the game and the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.030
 sense of priority so the game 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.190
 defenders must be in this sense of 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.260
 game they can not be across that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.470
 it's the first thing 2nd thing 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.000
 it's a priority to pick up and protect 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.830
 pick it up water because when one is 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.389
 upside down picking up the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.190
 ball we see that there is a defender who 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.690
 you crushes and so the rise they 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.050
 arbitrators ensure that priorities 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.639
 pickup the two-way priorities 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.550
 of the game are well respected it remains 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.650
 pretty physical because knows a little 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.510
 rugby corner say that there is one can go 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.790
 search one can go to score a player 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.040
 we can go get the ball try 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.510
 to hang down the snatch and 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.729
 learn it but all that in rules 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.820
 very strict at the level of the directions 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.710
 horses with now two 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.310
 divisions the bear ball grows into 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.320
 Belgium 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.120
 fourteen teams play in division 1 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.370
 including three francophones 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.290
 we are still far from the 700 team 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.050
 French neighbor but the goal is 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.530
 now to initiate young people 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.500
 when you know a craze 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.270
 growing mainly in France but 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.039
 also in belgium we launched since 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.419
 last year a promo tower division 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.760
 which is actually one of the missions 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.960
 specials reserved for young people 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.610
 young players is that they 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.800
 start they have no registration to 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.050
 so pay the fees are reduced but 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.400
 it boosts a little bit 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.080
 usually has a dozen 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.070
 of years to be able to start below that 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.660
 still 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.760
 young people in france a way of time in 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.500
 belgium and you have to find a club that 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.570
 accept ya clubs had untied 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.510
 dm is a club in ouaga for example who 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.780
 Sunday rolled 2h a kind of 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.270
 2 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.310
 two opening sessions for young people 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.310
 during the training to deny it 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.050
 hello today let's talk 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.210
 of the ideal weight of your horse is it 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.360
 too much is it too skinny what are the 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.910
 criteria the salt cellar the columbine the task 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.160
 that ribs and love handles 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.230
 near the pic or the oven or how 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:25.640
 evaluate the weight of your horse is 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:27.740
 taking the perimeter of his thorax in 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:36.730
 passing behind the withers and at 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:36.730
 level of the passage of straps 189 cm 545 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.030
 watchmen letter to the mayor what should 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.949
 you think 1 receives it enough to 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.199
 to eat according to his age in 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.969
 function of its activity 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.050
 two ati access to food sometimes 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.419
 there are several horses there are 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.659
 competition or your horse 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.979
 suffers from it and he can not move 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:01.870
 give you a good amount he has 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.060
 access to his ration may already be there 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.479
 a part where he do not take advantage of the 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:11.229
 ration check that it chews enough 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:13.409
 for a long time that his stools are beautiful that 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.520
 his tail is clean 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.439
 because there may be pathologies 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.849
 who are only at that below the horse 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.969
 to a big must called the big 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:23.710
 dorsal so ideally we should not see 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:24.689
 the sides May 6 in the lower third 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.199
 sides 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:32.710
 we must be able to see them where the 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:35.379
 feel here we do not see anymore but in 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.509
 again leaving you find that your 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:39.400
 horse be big eight times out of ten that's 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:41.860
 a problem of rations give you the 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.120
 same thing as usual maybe but 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.949
 forage does not always have every 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.750
 year the same energy value 

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:50.409
 you may have to change measures 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.460
 just that size can also 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.039
 to be explained by problems 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.319
 endocrine a blood test will allow 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:58.750
 to eliminate these problems also think about 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:01.180
 boredom on horseback that changed activity 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.159
 few places abruptly seek the 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.659
 any little piece of grass near and 

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:07.779
 little bit of straw in his 

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:11.969
 box and who tv with tmc guillaume
