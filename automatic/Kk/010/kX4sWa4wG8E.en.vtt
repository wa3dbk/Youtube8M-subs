horror<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.390> game<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.930> filling<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
horror this game is filling a very

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.500 
horror this game is filling a very
particular<00:00:22.859> niche<00:00:23.400> especially<00:00:23.970> considering

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
particular niche especially considering

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.349 
particular niche especially considering
its<00:00:24.600> pixel<00:00:25.140> art<00:00:25.260> design<00:00:25.710> however<00:00:26.609> including

its pixel art design however including

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.820 
its pixel art design however including
the<00:00:27.599> soundtrack<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.590> game<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the soundtrack I think this game is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.279 
the soundtrack I think this game is
doing<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.250> well<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.880> creating<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.810> tasteful

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
doing very well in creating a tasteful

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.139 
doing very well in creating a tasteful
atmosphere<00:00:31.740> dungeon<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.759> endless<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
atmosphere dungeon of the endless is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.340 
atmosphere dungeon of the endless is
actually<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> second<00:00:33.930> setting<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
actually the second setting in the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.200 
actually the second setting in the
endless<00:00:34.649> universe<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.700> takes<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
endless universe but this one takes a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
endless universe but this one takes a
drastically<00:00:36.780> different<00:00:36.899> direction<00:00:37.710> from

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
drastically different direction from

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.470 
drastically different direction from
that<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.340> many<00:00:38.610> other<00:00:38.700> games<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> say<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that and many other games to say the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.330 
that and many other games to say the
least<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.960> first<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.649> didn't<00:00:40.860> know<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> would

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
least at first I didn't know how I would

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
least at first I didn't know how I would
feel<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> game<00:00:42.660> since<00:00:42.930> controls<00:00:43.320> are

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
feel about the game since controls are

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
feel about the game since controls are
essentially<00:00:44.070> limited<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.789> buttons<00:00:45.210> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
essentially limited to two buttons and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
essentially limited to two buttons and
you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.050> pick<00:00:46.350> between<00:00:46.530> rooms<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.610> move

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you can only pick between rooms to move

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
you can only pick between rooms to move
instead<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> precise<00:00:48.809> directions<00:00:48.989> within<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
instead of precise directions within the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.310 
instead of precise directions within the
rooms<00:00:49.980> however<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.059> game<00:00:51.210> makes<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
rooms however the game makes up for that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
rooms however the game makes up for that
with<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> huge<00:00:53.070> depth<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> customization<00:00:54.149> since

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
with a huge depth of customization since

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.779 
with a huge depth of customization since
you<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.440> fact<00:00:55.649> need<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> build<00:00:56.399> machines

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
you do in fact need to build machines

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
you do in fact need to build machines
help<00:00:57.030> defend<00:00:57.300> your<00:00:57.329> rooms<00:00:57.600> yourself<00:00:58.199> and

ultimately your power crystal so the

ultimately your power crystal so the
goal<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> game<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.620> survive<00:01:02.070> this

game then it quickly morphs into a tower
defense<00:01:18.780> game<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:20.159> when<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> are

to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.270> spawned<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.350> place<00:02:22.500> modules<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
to be spawned you can place modules and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.770 
to be spawned you can place modules and
powered<00:02:23.640> rooms<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.150> help<00:02:24.300> produce<00:02:24.450> different

resources which are increased each time

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.240

you<00:02:27.150> open<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> new<00:02:27.570> room<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.470> generally<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
you open a new room so generally to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.770 
you open a new room so generally to
progress<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.910> want<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> open<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.390> many<00:02:30.420> rooms

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
progress you want to open as many rooms

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.290 
progress you want to open as many rooms
as<00:02:30.960> possible<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.100> also<00:02:32.340> where<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
as possible but this is also where the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.450 
as possible but this is also where the
risk<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:34.770> can<00:02:34.920> power<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.130> certain<00:02:35.400> number

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
risk is you can power a certain number

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.720 
risk is you can power a certain number
of<00:02:35.610> rooms<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.990> rooms<00:02:37.260> left<00:02:37.500> dark<00:02:37.860> will<00:02:38.460> spawn

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
of rooms but rooms left dark will spawn

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.480 
of rooms but rooms left dark will spawn
waves<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.300> monsters<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> more<00:02:40.890> rooms<00:02:41.220> open

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
waves of monsters so the more rooms open

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.670 
waves of monsters so the more rooms open
the<00:02:42.120> higher<00:02:42.300> chance<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.750> an<00:02:42.870> inbound<00:02:43.230> wave<00:02:43.470> on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the higher chance of an inbound wave on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.070 
the higher chance of an inbound wave on
your<00:02:43.800> next<00:02:44.070> room<00:02:44.250> opening<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.330> get<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.020> you

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
your next room opening you get it so you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.140 
your next room opening you get it so you
could<00:02:46.260> place<00:02:46.410> turrets<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.950> defensive<00:02:47.730> fields

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
could place turrets and defensive fields

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.580 
could place turrets and defensive fields
and<00:02:48.270> all<00:02:48.450> sorts<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.810> things<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.260> powered

rooms<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.160> long<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> resources

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570

they die guys they die it's over and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.860 
they die guys they die it's over and
some<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.520> different<00:02:59.790> abilities<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.390> each
