00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
little bit of a sparkly leave in there

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.469 
little bit of a sparkly leave in there
so<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.490> thought<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.640> was<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:11.970> nice

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so I just thought that was a really nice

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.050 
so I just thought that was a really nice
kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> color<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.250> nice<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.640> fall<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.280 
kind of color really nice for fall and
winter<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.159> 399<00:01:18.290> probably

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
winter so this was 399 probably
