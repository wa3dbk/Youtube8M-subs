will be basic and something you already
know<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.120> know<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> these<00:00:33.510> cars<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:35.370> will

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
know if you know to these cars this will

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.380 
know if you know to these cars this will
possibly<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.690> informative<00:00:37.550> now<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> front<00:00:38.940> sr

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
possibly be informative now the front sr

possibly be informative now the front sr
the<00:00:39.510> passenger<00:00:40.080> and<00:00:40.320> driver<00:00:40.559> side<00:00:40.710> seats<00:00:41.190> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the passenger and driver side seats are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.260 
the passenger and driver side seats are
anchored<00:00:42.720> roughly<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> same<00:00:43.320> way<00:00:43.560> so<00:00:44.270> or

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
anchored roughly the same way so or

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.780 
anchored roughly the same way so or
exactly<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> same<00:00:46.079> way<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.460> find<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
exactly the same way and I find the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.900 
exactly the same way and I find the
first<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.700> easiest<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.880> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
first thing to do the easiest thing to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
first thing to do the easiest thing to
do<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:52.050> raise<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> seat<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.190> high<00:00:53.610> as

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
do is to raise the seat up as high as

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.010 
do is to raise the seat up as high as
it'll<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:53.970> because<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.630> front<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it'll go because there's a front and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.310 
it'll go because there's a front and
back<00:00:55.079> adjustment<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> high-low<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.320> in

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
back adjustment and a high-low and in

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
back adjustment and a high-low and in
order<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.880> get<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.059> car<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> high-low

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
order to get the car to the high-low

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.430 
order to get the car to the high-low
adjustment<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.730> pull<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.140> lever

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
adjustment you pull up on this lever

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.050 
adjustment you pull up on this lever
right<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.250> find<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.550> easiest<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> do

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
right here and I find it easiest to do

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120 
right here and I find it easiest to do
this<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.020> seat<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.500> its<00:01:07.740> frontmost

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
this when the seat is in its frontmost

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
this when the seat is in its frontmost
position<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.000> pull<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.660> on<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> lever<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
position so pull up on this lever and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.040 
position so pull up on this lever and
move<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.039> seat<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.610> forward<00:01:12.050> which

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
move the seat all the way forward which

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.760 
move the seat all the way forward which
I've<00:01:13.229> already<00:01:13.440> done

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I've already done

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.090 
I've already done
and<00:01:14.190> then<00:01:15.180> once<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.780> forward

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
and then once it's all the way forward

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
and then once it's all the way forward
you<00:01:17.100> pull<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> side<00:01:18.000> lever<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.570> here

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you pull up on the side lever right here

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.140

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and you work the seat up because there's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
and you work the seat up because there's
two<00:01:24.299> sets<00:01:24.510> of<00:01:24.600> tracks<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.080> set<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.440> tracks<00:01:25.650> it

back of the rails and in this case the
portion<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.580> floor<00:02:19.820> where<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.420> rail

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
portion of the floor where this rail

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.750 
portion of the floor where this rail
anchors<00:02:21.260> seems<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.490> pretty<00:02:22.640> well

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
anchors seems to be pretty well

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.610 
anchors seems to be pretty well
disintegrated<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:23.750> I'm<00:02:23.870> probably<00:02:24.140> not<00:02:24.410> gonna

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
disintegrated so I'm probably not gonna

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.210 
disintegrated so I'm probably not gonna
have<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.860> remove<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.220> bolt<00:02:25.460> so<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:27.040> at<00:02:28.040> each

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
have to remove that bolt so one at each

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.480 
have to remove that bolt so one at each
of<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.430> rear<00:02:28.610> rails<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.370> to

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
of the rear rails and then you have to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.449 
of the rear rails and then you have to
pry<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.730> cap<00:02:32.240> off<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.920> there's

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
pry this cap off here and there's

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.130 
pry this cap off here and there's
another<00:02:34.700> bolt<00:02:34.940> behind<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.840> let<00:02:35.990> me<00:02:36.020> go

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
another bolt behind it so let me go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.140 
another bolt behind it so let me go
ahead<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.350> do<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.800> as<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.820> can<00:02:38.090> see

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
ahead and do that and as you can see

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.449 
ahead and do that and as you can see
there's<00:02:38.510> one<00:02:38.780> more<00:02:39.050> ten<00:02:39.440> millimeter<00:02:39.980> bolt<00:02:40.250> in

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
there's one more ten millimeter bolt in

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.550 
there's one more ten millimeter bolt in
there<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.000> I'm<00:02:41.780> going<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.020> get<00:02:42.110> these<00:02:42.200> three

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
there so I'm going to get these three

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.400 
there so I'm going to get these three
out<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.720> I'll<00:02:44.840> show<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.050> how<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.230> lift

to do anything with the seat right now

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.620 
to do anything with the seat right now
but<00:02:59.930> before<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:01.070> install<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:01.970> 83

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
but before I install this in the 83

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
but before I install this in the 83
obviously<00:03:03.350> I'm<00:03:03.440> gonna<00:03:03.560> clean<00:03:04.519> up<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.730> vinyl

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
obviously I'm gonna clean up the vinyl

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.400 
obviously I'm gonna clean up the vinyl
and<00:03:05.300> I'm<00:03:05.510> going<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.660> take<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.870> vinyl<00:03:06.170> off<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
and I'm going to take the vinyl off the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.930 
and I'm going to take the vinyl off the
frame<00:03:06.650> replaced<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.280> lot<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.519> padding

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
frame replaced a lot of the padding

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.660 
frame replaced a lot of the padding
because<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:09.650> pressing<00:03:09.860> on<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.220> seat<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
because as I'm pressing on the seat I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.340 
because as I'm pressing on the seat I
can<00:03:11.030> hear<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.360> horsehair<00:03:11.780> padding<00:03:12.170> just

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
can hear the horsehair padding just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.020 
can hear the horsehair padding just
disintegrating<00:03:13.480> which<00:03:14.480> means<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.880> know

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
disintegrating which means that you know

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.940 
disintegrating which means that you know
a<00:03:17.180> little<00:03:17.959> bit<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.230> driving<00:03:18.500> around<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.860> this

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
a little bit of driving around in this

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
a little bit of driving around in this
car<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:20.150> padding<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.480> just<00:03:20.600> going<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
car and the padding is just going to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.180 
car and the padding is just going to
completely<00:03:21.140> disintegrate<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.709> fall<00:03:21.860> out<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
completely disintegrate and fall out the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.970 
completely disintegrate and fall out the
bottom<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.260> take<00:03:24.260> care<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.620> before

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
bottom so I take care of that before

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.970 
bottom so I take care of that before
it's<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.160> problem<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.410> when<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.440> get<00:03:27.560> around<00:03:27.799> to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
it's a problem and when I get around to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.740 
it's a problem and when I get around to
that<00:03:28.010> obviously<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.700> will<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:29.090> videos<00:03:29.239> on<00:03:29.600> it

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
that obviously I will have videos on it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.960 
that obviously I will have videos on it
but<00:03:29.989> that's<00:03:30.080> going<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.519> probably<00:03:31.519> months

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
but that's going to be probably months

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.090 
but that's going to be probably months
down<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.330> road<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.470> Mercedes<00:03:33.920> diesel

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
down the road so this is Mercedes diesel
