00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
now and think about how things went

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.919 
now and think about how things went
today<00:00:07.940> we<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.269> couldn't<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.660> asked<00:00:09.870> for

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
today we we couldn't have asked for

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.669 
today we we couldn't have asked for
anything<00:00:10.170> more<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> game<00:00:12.469> you<00:00:13.469> know<00:00:13.530> we

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
anything more in the game you know we

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.050 
anything more in the game you know we
kept<00:00:13.950> an<00:00:14.219> incredible<00:00:14.790> attacking<00:00:15.330> team<00:00:15.540> quiet

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
kept an incredible attacking team quiet

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.400 
kept an incredible attacking team quiet
and<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:19.050> kept<00:00:19.289> getting<00:00:19.439> great<00:00:19.770> chances<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
and we kept getting great chances I

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
and we kept getting great chances I
guess<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> simple<00:00:23.279> fact<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> game

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
guess it's the simple fact in the game

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.320 
guess it's the simple fact in the game
is<00:00:24.769> they<00:00:25.769> scored<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> fantastic<00:00:26.880> goal<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> win

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
really did I mean I think almost the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.010 
really did I mean I think almost the
entire<00:02:39.490> game<00:02:39.760> we're<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.300> front<00:02:40.480> foot<00:02:40.630> and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
entire game we're on the front foot and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.170 
entire game we're on the front foot and
so<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.890> can't<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.280> mean<00:02:45.400> if<00:02:45.490> you<00:02:45.760> watch<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
so you can't I mean if you watch the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.840 
so you can't I mean if you watch the
game<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.990> everything<00:02:47.320> there<00:02:47.710> I<00:02:48.010> think

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
game you have everything there I think

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.880 
game you have everything there I think
we<00:02:48.970> were<00:02:49.150> first<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.050> almost<00:02:50.200> every<00:02:50.710> category

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
we were first in almost every category

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.510 
we were first in almost every category
but<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.180> wins<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.480> game<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.020> so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
but the one that wins the game and so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.430 
but the one that wins the game and so
that's<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.730> cruel<00:02:54.940> part<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.330> soccer<00:02:55.570> we've

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
that's the cruel part of soccer we've

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.770 
that's the cruel part of soccer we've
been<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.770> both<00:02:57.010> sides<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.700> many<00:02:58.420> many<00:02:58.540> times
