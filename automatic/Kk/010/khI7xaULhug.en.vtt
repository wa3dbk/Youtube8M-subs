Optimus Prime and a different angle

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.650 
Optimus Prime and a different angle
we'll<00:00:36.440> just<00:00:36.620> put<00:00:36.769> this<00:00:36.920> one<00:00:37.100> here<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:37.699> move

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
we'll just put this one here and move

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.380 
we'll just put this one here and move
them<00:00:38.809> over<00:00:38.900> here<00:00:39.940> as<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.030> can<00:00:41.120> see<00:00:41.239> they're

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
them over here as you can see they're

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.610 
them over here as you can see they're
completely<00:00:41.630> different<00:00:41.750> in<00:00:42.110> their<00:00:42.230> all<00:00:42.350> modes

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
completely different in their all modes

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.049 
completely different in their all modes
but<00:00:42.860> at<00:00:42.950> least<00:00:43.040> you<00:00:43.190> get<00:00:43.309> an<00:00:43.399> idea<00:00:43.670> of<00:00:43.790> what

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
but at least you get an idea of what

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.260 
but at least you get an idea of what
they<00:00:44.180> look<00:00:44.329> like<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:44.840> comparison<00:00:46.270> already

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
they look like in comparison already

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.290 
they look like in comparison already
there<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.410> one<00:00:48.860> more<00:00:49.010> look<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.460> way<00:00:49.730> and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
there is one more look this way and

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.600 
there is one more look this way and
we'll<00:00:50.570> flip<00:00:50.960> around<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.890> here's<00:00:52.340> how<00:00:52.489> it

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
we'll flip around and here's how it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.709 
we'll flip around and here's how it
looks<00:00:52.789> this<00:00:52.879> way<00:00:57.309> not<00:00:58.309> bad<00:00:58.550> really<00:00:59.300> nice<00:00:59.420> job

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
looks this way not bad really nice job

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.109 
looks this way not bad really nice job
for<00:00:59.870> such<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.050> small<00:01:00.199> figure<00:01:03.460> now<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.520> transform

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
for such a small figure now to transform

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.310 
for such a small figure now to transform
them<00:01:05.239> all<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.960> have<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.410> is<00:01:08.140> separate<00:01:09.140> his

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
them all you have to do is separate his

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.789 
them all you have to do is separate his
handle<00:01:09.710> here<00:01:09.920> these<00:01:10.640> will<00:01:10.850> form<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.180> his<00:01:11.270> legs

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
handle here these will form of his legs

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:20.830 
handle here these will form of his legs
twist<00:01:12.799> them<00:01:12.950> around<00:01:16.540> there<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.750> go<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:20.150> take

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
twist them around there you go you take

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.249 
twist them around there you go you take
this<00:01:21.110> barrel<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.010> fold<00:01:22.670> them<00:01:22.880> down<00:01:23.259> you

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
this barrel and you fold them down you

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.440 
this barrel and you fold them down you
take<00:01:24.439> this<00:01:24.560> bottom<00:01:24.950> part<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:26.750> pull<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.200> out

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
take this bottom part you pull it out

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.010 
take this bottom part you pull it out
like<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:30.650> bring<00:01:30.920> these<00:01:32.020> two

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
like that and you bring these two

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.760 
like that and you bring these two
together<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.680> will<00:01:33.920> form<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.250> Hannah<00:01:34.909> cannon

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
together that will form is Hannah cannon

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.240 
together that will form is Hannah cannon
and<00:01:36.770> you're<00:01:36.820> going<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.119> swing<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:39.470> very
