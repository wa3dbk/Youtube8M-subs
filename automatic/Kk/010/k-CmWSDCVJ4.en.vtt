00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.839 

paper<00:02:07.929> dolls<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:10.650> you<00:02:11.650> can<00:02:11.920> cut<00:02:12.370> these<00:02:12.580> up

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
paper dolls and you can cut these up

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.589 
paper dolls and you can cut these up
there<00:02:13.390> they're<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:14.260> contrived<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.370> me

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
there they're a little contrived for me

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.140 
there they're a little contrived for me
but<00:02:16.599> let's<00:02:17.379> cut<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.459> just<00:02:18.519> see<00:02:19.000> what

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
but let's cut this out and just see what

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.080 
but let's cut this out and just see what
it<00:02:19.269> looks<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.769> because<00:02:20.769> it's<00:02:21.190> easy<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.670> I

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
it looks like because it's easy so I

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.930 
it looks like because it's easy so I
don't<00:02:25.690> really<00:02:25.810> have<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.500> trim<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:26.830> super<00:02:27.700> close

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
don't really have to trim it super close

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.300 
don't really have to trim it super close
because<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.690> always<00:02:28.930> go<00:02:29.170> back<00:02:29.349> in<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.920> any

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
because I can always go back in and any

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.610 
because I can always go back in and any
white<00:02:30.640> that's<00:02:30.940> showing<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.569> can<00:02:31.930> touch<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.500> up

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
white that's showing I can touch it up

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.229 
white that's showing I can touch it up
with<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:34.209> felt<00:02:35.140> pen<00:02:35.379> like<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> Copic<00:02:36.099> marker<00:02:36.489> so

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
with a a felt pen like a Copic marker so

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.960 
with a a felt pen like a Copic marker so
if<00:02:37.599> if<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.890> green

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
if if it's like on the green

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.690 
if if it's like on the green
I<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.299> find<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.690> lime<00:02:40.870> green<00:02:40.900> marker<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.130> I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
I just find a lime green marker and I

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.580 
I just find a lime green marker and I
would<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.840> would<00:02:44.019> just<00:02:44.260> color

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
would go in there and I would just color

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.620 
would go in there and I would just color
the<00:02:44.920> edges<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.910> didn't<00:02:46.420> feel<00:02:46.540> like

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
the edges that I didn't feel like

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.330 
the edges that I didn't feel like
cutting<00:02:47.049> this<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.739> pretty<00:02:47.980> straightforward

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
cutting this is a pretty straightforward

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.170 
cutting this is a pretty straightforward
design<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:49.989> could<00:02:50.319> go<00:02:50.500> oh<00:02:50.799> I<00:02:51.610> can<00:02:51.819> use<00:02:51.879> them

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
design so I could go oh I can use them

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.690 
design so I could go oh I can use them
on<00:02:52.329> there<00:02:52.569> or<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.260> use<00:02:53.470> them<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.769> there<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.190> like

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
on there or you use them on there I like

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.360 
on there or you use them on there I like
I<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.540> over<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.170> seems<00:02:56.410> like<00:02:56.709> it's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
I like it over there it seems like it's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.630 
I like it over there it seems like it's
a<00:02:57.519> good<00:02:57.700> fit<00:02:58.000> for<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> since<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.280> already

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
a good fit for that so since I already

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.460 
a good fit for that so since I already
cut<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.269> kind<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.540> want<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.810> use<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.230> I

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
cut it out I kind of want to use it I

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.220 
cut it out I kind of want to use it I
try<00:03:03.430> not<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.879> talk<00:03:04.030> myself<00:03:04.299> out<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.840> things

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
try not to talk myself out of things

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.160 
try not to talk myself out of things
unless<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.769> really<00:03:06.430> really<00:03:06.700> hate<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> now<00:03:07.269> at

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
unless I really really hate it now at

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.839 
unless I really really hate it now at
this<00:03:08.319> point<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.739> might<00:03:08.890> try<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.370> right

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
this point I might try and go right

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.150 
this point I might try and go right
underneath<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.840> edge<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.650> piece<00:03:12.010> of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
underneath the edge of that piece of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.360 
underneath the edge of that piece of
collage<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.370> already<00:03:13.239> put<00:03:13.480> down<00:03:14.190> which<00:03:15.190> I'm

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
collage I already put down which I'm

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.039 
collage I already put down which I'm
having<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.790> hard<00:03:15.940> time<00:03:16.000> with<00:03:16.329> even<00:03:16.690> though<00:03:16.840> I

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
having a hard time with even though I

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.460 
having a hard time with even though I
know<00:03:17.170> there's<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.530> lot<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.709> space<00:03:17.980> there<00:03:18.310> we<00:03:18.459> go

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
know there's a lot of space there we go

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.400 
know there's a lot of space there we go
and<00:03:22.530> that's<00:03:23.530> down<00:03:23.819> now<00:03:24.819> for<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.180> body<00:03:25.389> of<00:03:25.840> this

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
and that's down now for the body of this

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.940 
and that's down now for the body of this
guy<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:27.849> can<00:03:27.880> either<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> big<00:03:29.139> lumpy

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
guy we can either just do a big lumpy

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.479 
guy we can either just do a big lumpy
shape<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:34.410> let's<00:03:35.410> take<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.190> for

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
shape just let's take it this for

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.809 
shape just let's take it this for
instance<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.209> could<00:03:38.010> I'm<00:03:39.010> kind<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.370> looking<00:03:39.730> at

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
instance I could I'm kind of looking at

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.830 
instance I could I'm kind of looking at
this<00:03:40.030> okay<00:03:40.569> it's<00:03:40.870> gonna<00:03:41.019> be<00:03:41.109> about<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.680> tall

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
this okay it's gonna be about this tall

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.940 
this okay it's gonna be about this tall
and<00:03:43.840> then<00:03:46.709> make<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.739> mountain<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.590> have<00:03:50.739> done

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
and then make a mountain and I have done

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.250 
and then make a mountain and I have done
this<00:03:51.130> many<00:03:51.459> times<00:03:51.849> if<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.480> see<00:03:52.720> my<00:03:52.870> journals

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
this many times if you see my journals

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.470 
this many times if you see my journals
so<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.040> can<00:03:54.250> make<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.430> shape<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:54.940> for

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
so you can make a shape like that for

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
so you can make a shape like that for
body<00:03:55.660> shapes<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.319> found<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.540> image<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:59.049> I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
body shapes I found this image and I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.960 
body shapes I found this image and I
really<00:03:59.799> like<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.250> black<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.459> white<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
really like the black and white of the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.710 
really like the black and white of the
shoes<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:01.840> color<00:04:02.109> so<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.519> might<00:04:04.389> just<00:04:04.419> go

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
shoes and this color so I might just go

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.390 
shoes and this color so I might just go
you<00:04:05.260> know<00:04:05.290> what<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.530> don't<00:04:05.709> really<00:04:06.069> know<00:04:06.220> if<00:04:06.310> I

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
you know what I don't really know if I

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.640 
you know what I don't really know if I
want<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.639> use<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.000> but<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:07.959> takes<00:04:08.169> just<00:04:08.500> a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
want to use this but it takes just a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.979 
want to use this but it takes just a
second<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.579> cut<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:13.239> I'm<00:04:13.329> going<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:13.720> cut

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
second to cut so I'm going to just cut

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.929 
second to cut so I'm going to just cut
it<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.260> see<00:04:14.560> if<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.709> want<00:04:14.919> to<00:04:14.980> use<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.310> if<00:04:15.760> I

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
it and see if I want to use it if I

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.310 
it and see if I want to use it if I
don't<00:04:16.269> use<00:04:16.539> it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
don't use it

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.280 
don't use it
I'll<00:04:17.950> definitely<00:04:18.820> save<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.630> I'm<00:04:19.900> sure

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
I'll definitely save it and I'm sure

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.620 
I'll definitely save it and I'm sure
that<00:04:21.190> I'll<00:04:21.370> find<00:04:21.610> someplace<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:22.060> use<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.540> at

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that I'll find someplace to use it at

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.960 
that I'll find someplace to use it at
some<00:04:22.810> point<00:04:22.870> in<00:04:23.140> time<00:04:24.300> all<00:04:25.300> right<00:04:25.480> so<00:04:26.970> you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
some point in time all right so you

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.160 
some point in time all right so you
actually<00:04:28.150> don't<00:04:28.480> even<00:04:28.600> have<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:28.900> cut<00:04:29.050> that

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
actually don't even have to cut that

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.360 
actually don't even have to cut that
middle<00:04:29.440> up<00:04:29.530> but<00:04:29.770> it's<00:04:29.890> not<00:04:30.040> gonna<00:04:30.160> be<00:04:30.340> very

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
middle up but it's not gonna be very

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.910 
middle up but it's not gonna be very
difficult<00:04:30.790> so<00:04:31.390> I'm<00:04:32.020> not<00:04:32.200> worrying<00:04:32.470> about<00:04:32.650> your

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
difficult so I'm not worrying about your

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.330 
difficult so I'm not worrying about your
shoelaces<00:04:33.460> I'm<00:04:33.910> just<00:04:34.120> cutting<00:04:34.300> them<00:04:34.540> off<00:04:35.340> and

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
shoelaces I'm just cutting them off and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.110 
shoelaces I'm just cutting them off and
again<00:04:36.820> I'm<00:04:37.510> not<00:04:37.840> doing<00:04:38.230> this<00:04:38.410> fast<00:04:39.120> because

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
again I'm not doing this fast because

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.400 
again I'm not doing this fast because
I'm<00:04:40.780> trying<00:04:41.170> to<00:04:41.350> do<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.130> video<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:43.170> normally<00:04:44.170> work

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
I'm trying to do a video I normally work

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:52.230 
I'm trying to do a video I normally work
this<00:04:44.620> fast<00:04:48.300> so<00:04:49.440> well<00:04:50.440> obviously<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:51.790> gonna

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
this fast so well obviously that's gonna

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.910 
this fast so well obviously that's gonna
be<00:04:52.510> too<00:04:52.780> long<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.440> could<00:04:54.130> go<00:04:54.580> mmm

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
be too long I could go mmm

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.100 
be too long I could go mmm
do<00:04:56.920> I<00:04:56.980> like<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.940> know<00:04:58.120> coming<00:04:58.570> out<00:04:58.810> from

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
do I like that you know coming out from

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.760 
do I like that you know coming out from
there<00:04:59.320> I<00:05:00.180> probably<00:05:01.180> would<00:05:01.750> but<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.230> can't<00:05:02.500> see

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
there I probably would but you can't see

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.770 
there I probably would but you can't see
it<00:05:02.800> so<00:05:03.400> I<00:05:03.430> almost<00:05:03.700> feel<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.060> okay<00:05:04.540> I'm<00:05:04.630> gonna

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
it so I almost feel like okay I'm gonna

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.800 
it so I almost feel like okay I'm gonna
waste<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.260> if<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.860> use<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.100> there<00:05:06.520> so<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.540> may

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
waste that if I use it there so I may

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.650 
waste that if I use it there so I may
just<00:05:07.840> slap<00:05:08.350> it<00:05:08.380> down<00:05:08.590> somewhere<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:10.120> maybe

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
just slap it down somewhere like maybe

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.900 
just slap it down somewhere like maybe
I'll<00:05:10.840> stop<00:05:11.140> slap<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.680> there<00:05:11.860> in<00:05:12.250> fact<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.730> am

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
I'll stop slap it there in fact I am

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.440 
I'll stop slap it there in fact I am
going<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:14.100> because<00:05:15.100> what<00:05:15.730> this<00:05:15.940> is<00:05:16.120> going<00:05:16.330> to

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
going to because what this is going to

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.840 
going to because what this is going to
do<00:05:16.660> is<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.260> next<00:05:17.470> time<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:17.830> go<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.130> that<00:05:18.550> page

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
do is the next time I go to that page

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.820 
do is the next time I go to that page
and<00:05:18.880> they<00:05:19.180> start<00:05:19.480> working<00:05:19.690> on<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.170> it's

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
and they start working on it it's

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.650 
and they start working on it it's
already<00:05:21.250> going<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.580> have<00:05:21.730> something<00:05:22.210> started

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
already going to have something started

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.710 
already going to have something started
on<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.680> is<00:05:23.890> going<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.190> be<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.700> fun<00:05:25.690> challenge

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
on it it is going to be a fun challenge

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.010 
on it it is going to be a fun challenge
to<00:05:26.530> find<00:05:26.770> something<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:29.010> make<00:05:30.010> it<00:05:30.040> work

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
to find something to make it work

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.840 
to find something to make it work
so<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.740> only<00:05:32.920> thing<00:05:33.130> that's<00:05:33.310> different<00:05:33.370> right

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
so the only thing that's different right

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.780 
so the only thing that's different right
now<00:05:34.120> is<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:35.050> don't<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.920> kind<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:36.520> pulled

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
now is that I don't I kind of pulled

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.100 
now is that I don't I kind of pulled
some<00:05:37.000> stuff<00:05:37.210> out<00:05:37.390> so<00:05:37.600> I<00:05:37.660> wouldn't<00:05:37.900> have<00:05:38.020> to

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
some stuff out so I wouldn't have to

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.280 
some stuff out so I wouldn't have to
take<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.470> time<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.920> look<00:05:39.100> for<00:05:39.340> stuff<00:05:39.580> but<00:05:40.330> you

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
take the time to look for stuff but you

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.370 
take the time to look for stuff but you
know<00:05:41.410> I<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:42.460> kind<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:43.090> like<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:43.300> work<00:05:44.140> like<00:05:44.350> that

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
know I I kind of like to work like that

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.760 
know I I kind of like to work like that
but<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:44.710> kind<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:44.980> like<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.370> look<00:05:45.400> for

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
but I kind of like to look for

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.440 
but I kind of like to look for
particular<00:05:47.770> things<00:05:47.800> that<00:05:48.430> kind<00:05:48.910> of<00:05:49.030> come<00:05:49.270> to

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
particular things that kind of come to

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.490 
particular things that kind of come to
mind<00:05:49.600> so<00:05:50.440> I<00:05:51.330> know<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.360> I<00:05:52.570> have<00:05:52.930> something

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
mind so I know that I have something

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.260 
mind so I know that I have something
else<00:05:53.890> that<00:05:54.070> I<00:05:54.340> was<00:05:54.490> thinking<00:05:54.670> about<00:05:54.880> for<00:05:55.210> the

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
else that I was thinking about for the

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.610 
else that I was thinking about for the
body<00:05:55.510> here<00:05:55.930> this<00:05:56.490> one<00:05:57.490> I<00:05:57.640> can't<00:05:57.880> find<00:05:58.120> it<00:05:58.620> we're

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
body here this one I can't find it we're

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.070 
body here this one I can't find it we're
just<00:05:59.680> gonna<00:05:59.860> go<00:06:00.190> with<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:02.560> bumpy<00:06:03.040> shape<00:06:03.340> oh

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.500 

this<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:08.230> thought<00:06:08.410> was<00:06:08.590> really<00:06:08.860> interesting<00:06:11.010> so

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
this I thought was really interesting so

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.600 
this I thought was really interesting so
this<00:06:13.510> is<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.780> picture<00:06:14.080> again<00:06:15.070> this<00:06:15.280> is<00:06:15.460> an

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
this is a picture again this is an

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.580 
this is a picture again this is an
artist<00:06:16.030> probably<00:06:16.780> from<00:06:16.900> that<00:06:16.930> same<00:06:17.320> chick

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
artist probably from that same chick

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.760 
artist probably from that same chick
suppose<00:06:17.980> magazine<00:06:18.780> but<00:06:19.780> what's<00:06:20.410> really

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
suppose magazine but what's really

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.190 
suppose magazine but what's really
driving<00:06:21.100> me<00:06:21.400> to<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:21.730> actually<00:06:22.510> it<00:06:22.720> was<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:22.960> red

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
driving me to it actually it was the red

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.090 
driving me to it actually it was the red
with<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.770> dots<00:06:23.980> in<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.640> so<00:06:25.390> I<00:06:26.100> was

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
with the dots in it and so I was

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.840 
with the dots in it and so I was
thinking

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
thinking

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.170 
thinking
earlier<00:06:28.630> that<00:06:29.140> I<00:06:29.170> could<00:06:30.390> either<00:06:32.340> um<00:06:33.340> go

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
earlier that I could either um go

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.440 
earlier that I could either um go
upside-down<00:06:34.680> make<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.710> bumpy<00:06:36.100> shape<00:06:36.420> or<00:06:37.420> I

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
upside-down make a bumpy shape or I

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.270 
upside-down make a bumpy shape or I
could<00:06:37.720> go<00:06:37.840> that<00:06:38.020> way<00:06:38.170> I'm<00:06:38.410> actually<00:06:38.860> thinking

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
could go that way I'm actually thinking

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.840 
could go that way I'm actually thinking
that<00:06:39.790> I<00:06:40.120> like<00:06:40.720> this<00:06:40.900> idea<00:06:41.080> so<00:06:41.520> first<00:06:42.520> thing<00:06:42.700> I'm

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
that I like this idea so first thing I'm

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.270 
that I like this idea so first thing I'm
going<00:06:43.000> to<00:06:43.090> do<00:06:43.270> you<00:06:43.630> can<00:06:43.840> always<00:06:44.080> if<00:06:44.890> there's<00:06:45.160> a

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
going to do you can always if there's a

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.010 
going to do you can always if there's a
couple<00:06:45.670> of<00:06:45.730> different<00:06:46.060> directions<00:06:46.090> that<00:06:46.630> you

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
couple of different directions that you

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.260 
couple of different directions that you
think<00:06:47.320> you<00:06:47.440> can<00:06:47.650> go<00:06:47.770> with<00:06:47.980> something<00:06:48.270> always

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
think you can go with something always

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.800 
think you can go with something always
do<00:06:49.570> the<00:06:49.750> one<00:06:49.990> that<00:06:50.890> requires<00:06:51.600> more<00:06:52.600> of<00:06:52.720> the

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
do the one that requires more of the

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.540 
do the one that requires more of the
image<00:06:52.990> because<00:06:53.590> you<00:06:53.740> can<00:06:53.890> always<00:06:54.100> trim<00:06:54.490> it

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
image because you can always trim it

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.920 
image because you can always trim it
down<00:06:54.820> and<00:06:55.060> try<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.300> other<00:06:55.630> thing<00:06:56.250> so<00:06:57.250> I<00:06:57.930> don't

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
down and try the other thing so I don't

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.750 
down and try the other thing so I don't
know<00:06:59.290> if<00:06:59.410> this<00:06:59.560> is<00:06:59.680> going<00:06:59.830> to<00:06:59.920> work<00:06:59.950> and<00:07:00.340> but

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
know if this is going to work and but

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.460 
know if this is going to work and but
this<00:07:00.910> is<00:07:01.090> the<00:07:01.270> way<00:07:01.390> that<00:07:01.630> I<00:07:01.660> work<00:07:01.930> and<00:07:02.110> I<00:07:02.170> wanted

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
this is the way that I work and I wanted

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.160 
this is the way that I work and I wanted
you<00:07:02.620> to<00:07:02.740> see<00:07:02.950> it<00:07:02.980> I<00:07:03.280> get<00:07:04.030> an<00:07:04.150> idea<00:07:04.300> and<00:07:04.780> I<00:07:04.900> just

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.170 
you to see it I get an idea and I just

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.280 
you to see it I get an idea and I just
see<00:07:05.350> do<00:07:06.070> I<00:07:06.160> like<00:07:06.370> that<00:07:06.400> or<00:07:06.820> do<00:07:06.940> I<00:07:06.970> not<00:07:07.240> it<00:07:07.990> didn't

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290
