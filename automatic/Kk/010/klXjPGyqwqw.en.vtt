00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.440
 cleanser that I actually like and with 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.270
 falling on sponge kojak remembers everything 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.469

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.590
 time is not it and so I take 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.090
 always a lotion must always 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.800
 take a motion after putting in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.330
 the water on your face it's really 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.980
 to remove the limestone in that's it 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.110
 which is fine then I take one ultimate 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.280
 steam bath runs just for 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.540
 open the pores not what I'm going 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.870
 to make a scrub and a mask took 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.670
 so here it's lost in dreams talk about 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.650
 at lush which is really great so 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.190
 scrubs and masks to make one to two 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.200
 times per week 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.360
 so here I take the black gold from home 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.129
 that they try century in the green meadow 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.049
 very little I will join with 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.340
 water to make a little paw or 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.230
 it's a little disgusting as 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 flat but it is really very effective 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.579
 so in fact there I am all 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.319
 simply with an expense projects that 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.630
 are very sweet it's a sponge treats 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.060
 so then I take the mask the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.030
 titan buttons war terribly 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.500
 fabre we finally need are moderate 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.019
 really not good at all but good 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 it's a mask really very very 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.099
 effective we can see a little bit I 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.000
 do not know the ten pieces of pickers 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.470
 in fact it's very elegant 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.450
 I will come here who simply 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.730
 with a brush from her home it is there in 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.150
 layers very important because a 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.590
 match a forgiveness forgiveness mask for these 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.870
 thick layer sconces 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.359
 he is allowed to pose for ten minutes and after 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.130
 ten minutes that's a little dried up the game 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.760
 reims with prose always the same 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.160
 jacques 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.720
 Then I take my cream bus green 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.540
 the one that is just a killing 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.459
 for the evening is really great it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.440
 absorbs remo sebum and in the morning we are 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.480
 not like mirror ball and I find 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.370

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.540

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.910

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.260
 the author of the hit you then I 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.450
 take my medicine because I have 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.650
 eczema to the eye contour in fact and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.250
 in the palm of my hand so 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.959
 so that's very disturbing 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.370
 sees the end the exam never got too much 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.329
 five years over it itches 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.709
 of English and audible so that's after 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.090
 down I brush my teeth like 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.640

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.109
