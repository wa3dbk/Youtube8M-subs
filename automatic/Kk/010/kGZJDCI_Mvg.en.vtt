00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
completing these life cycles we can go

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.709 
completing these life cycles we can go
into<00:00:54.329> dormant<00:00:55.020> stages<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.949> flea<00:00:56.340> pupae<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
into dormant stages the flea pupae you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
into dormant stages the flea pupae you
remember<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> goes<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.469> egg<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> larva

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
remember it goes from an egg to a larva

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
remember it goes from an egg to a larva
the<00:01:00.090> larva<00:01:00.120> has<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> blood<00:01:01.320> meal<00:01:01.590> which

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the larva has to have a blood meal which

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
the larva has to have a blood meal which
it<00:01:02.280> gets<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> adult<00:01:03.090> fleas<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> are

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it gets from the adult fleas that are

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
it gets from the adult fleas that are
feeding<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.189> goes<00:01:05.460> into<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.820> pupa<00:01:06.090> stage

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
feeding then it goes into a pupa stage

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810 
feeding then it goes into a pupa stage
it<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:06.990> stay<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.470> wait<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.369> pupa<00:01:08.790> stage

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it can stay in wait in that pupa stage

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.109 
it can stay in wait in that pupa stage
for<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:10.200> year's<00:01:10.560> time<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> problem

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
for over one year's time now the problem

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.870 
for over one year's time now the problem
is<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.560> nothing<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.490> pupa

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is is if there's nothing for that pupa

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
is is if there's nothing for that pupa
to<00:01:15.000> feed<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:15.869> no<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.200> walking

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to feed on there's no people walking

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.560 
to feed on there's no people walking
around<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.700> no<00:01:17.880> animals<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> area

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
around or there's no animals in the area

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
around or there's no animals in the area
for<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> flea<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> feed<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.340> stay<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
for the flea to feed on it can stay and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
for the flea to feed on it can stay and
wait<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.540> pupa<00:01:22.259> stage<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> year

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
wait in that pupa stage for over a year

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
wait in that pupa stage for over a year
so<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:25.049> fleas<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.189> wait<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.670> long<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.299> may

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so if fleas can wait that long you may

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.740 
so if fleas can wait that long you may
leave<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:29.189> home<00:01:29.460> let's<00:01:29.700> say<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.570> up

leave your home let's say you can go up

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.710 
leave your home let's say you can go up
north<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:32.130> might<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.850> gone<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.450> six

north and you might be gone for six
eight<00:01:33.869> months<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.070> come<00:01:35.280> back

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
eight months and then you can come back
