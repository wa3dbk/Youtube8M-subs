00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
saltwater fly lines the first is called

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.010 
saltwater fly lines the first is called
ride<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> waves<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.790> again<00:01:36.090> floats<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> top

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
ride the waves which again floats on top

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560 
ride the waves which again floats on top
of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> water<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.979> nice<00:01:38.189> high<00:01:38.460> vis<00:01:38.790> fly<00:01:39.299> line

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of the water a nice high vis fly line

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530 
of the water a nice high vis fly line
with<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:41.280> dense<00:01:41.490> core<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.509> a

with a really dense core on this one a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.810 
with a really dense core on this one a
dense<00:01:42.960> cordon<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.100> fish<00:01:44.369> saltwater

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
dense cordon so if you do fish saltwater

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.690 
dense cordon so if you do fish saltwater
tropically<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.350> fly<00:01:46.619> won't<00:01:46.920> break<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.430> and

tropically this fly won't break down and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
tropically this fly won't break down and
actually<00:01:48.240> become<00:01:49.020> softer<00:01:49.590> under<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> actual

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
