steak<00:00:11.250> cuts<00:00:11.519> out<00:00:11.730> there<00:00:11.969> some<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.840> different

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
steak cuts out there some have different

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.749 
steak cuts out there some have different
subtleties<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> might<00:00:14.309> grill<00:00:14.610> it

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
subtleties in the way I might grill it

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.670 
subtleties in the way I might grill it
or<00:00:14.849> not<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.690> I'm<00:00:15.809> gonna<00:00:15.929> do<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.379> use

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
or not what I'm gonna do is actually use

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.200 
or not what I'm gonna do is actually use
two<00:00:16.980> cups<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:17.340> gonna<00:00:17.460> use<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> fillet<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.119> I'm

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
two cups I'm gonna use a fillet and I'm

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.910 
two cups I'm gonna use a fillet and I'm
going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> use<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> New<00:00:19.199> York<00:00:19.380> Strip

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
going to use a New York Strip

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.590 
going to use a New York Strip
but<00:00:20.460> you'll<00:00:20.550> notice<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.359> doing

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
but you'll notice that and I'm doing

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
but you'll notice that and I'm doing
those<00:00:21.720> two<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.590> they<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:22.920> pretty<00:00:23.279> darn

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
those two because they are pretty darn

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.920 
those two because they are pretty darn
common<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.240> they're<00:00:24.660> different

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
common out there they're different

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.990 
common out there they're different
thicknesses<00:00:25.650> right<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.490> may<00:00:26.670> come<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
thicknesses right so you may come to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.429 
thicknesses right so you may come to
them<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.359> say<00:00:27.420> hi<00:00:27.660> while<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> gotta<00:00:28.260> cook

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
them and say hi while I gotta cook

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
them and say hi while I gotta cook
differently<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.460> core<00:00:29.699> techniques<00:00:30.210> are

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
differently the core techniques are

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.209 
differently the core techniques are
actually<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> same<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.769> we're<00:00:31.890> gonna<00:00:31.980> do

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
actually the same what we're gonna do

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.560 
actually the same what we're gonna do
differently<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:32.820> cook<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> thicker

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
differently is just cook the thicker

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690 
differently is just cook the thicker
steak<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.469> longer<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
steak a little bit longer to get to the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.729 
steak a little bit longer to get to the
same<00:00:35.940> doneness<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.690> me<00:00:36.840> that's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
same doneness for me that's a that's a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.920 
same doneness for me that's a that's a
medium-rare<00:00:38.160> steak<00:00:38.340> again<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
medium-rare steak again if you want to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
medium-rare steak again if you want to
bring<00:00:40.410> yours<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> medium<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.309> medium<00:00:41.579> well

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
bring yours to medium or medium well

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
bring yours to medium or medium well
you're<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.420> changing<00:00:42.510> anything<00:00:43.290> here

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you're not really changing anything here

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.020 
you're not really changing anything here
you're<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.370> cook<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> little

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you're just gonna cook it for a little

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.990 
you're just gonna cook it for a little
bit<00:00:45.210> longer<00:00:45.390> really<00:00:46.289> simple<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.039> some

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
bit longer really simple to do some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
bit longer really simple to do some
people<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.480> intimidated<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
people get intimidated with the with the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.709 
people get intimidated with the with the
grill<00:00:50.129> mistakes<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
grill mistakes but really not all that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
grill mistakes but really not all that
hard<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:53.039> four<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.430> five<00:00:53.610> key

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
hard if you know these four or five key

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.080 
hard if you know these four or five key
principles<00:00:54.719> techniques<00:00:55.699> let's<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.850> ahead<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
principles techniques let's go ahead and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
principles techniques let's go ahead and
get<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.449> okay<00:00:58.230> let's<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.500> ahead<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.770> start

get to it okay let's go ahead and start

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
get to it okay let's go ahead and start
talking<00:00:59.399> about<00:00:59.489> grilling<00:01:00.059> steaks<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
talking about grilling steaks how to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
talking about grilling steaks how to
grill<00:01:01.170> steaks<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.609> two<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.000> I've

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
grill steaks now I've got two here I've

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
grill steaks now I've got two here I've
got<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> New<00:01:03.449> York<00:01:03.629> Strip<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.769> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
got a New York Strip which is kind of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
got a New York Strip which is kind of
the<00:01:04.949> long<00:01:05.220> skinnier<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> cut<00:01:07.470> from

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the long skinnier one this is a cut from

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440 
the long skinnier one this is a cut from
the<00:01:07.680> loin<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> filet<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.270> from<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the loin the filet here is from the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
the loin the filet here is from the
tenderloin<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.380> reason<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:10.740> doing<00:01:10.890> two

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
tenderloin the reason I'm doing two

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
tenderloin the reason I'm doing two
because<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.119> obviously<00:01:12.420> much

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because this one is obviously much

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.510 
because this one is obviously much
thicker<00:01:12.960> than<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.280> not

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
thicker than this one but that's not

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
thicker than this one but that's not
really<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:14.909> change<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.479> core<00:01:15.990> techniques

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
really gonna change the core techniques

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
really gonna change the core techniques
that<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.670> still<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.000> use

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that we use we're still going to use

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
that we use we're still going to use
high<00:01:18.270> heat<00:01:18.299> still<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.140> seasoning

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
high heat still going to use seasoning

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
high heat still going to use seasoning
all<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> same<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.549> we're<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:20.970> gonna<00:01:21.150> let

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
all the same things we're just gonna let

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
all the same things we're just gonna let
this<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.409> longer<00:01:22.619> because

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this one go a little bit longer because

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.230 
this one go a little bit longer because
the<00:01:23.369> heats<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> move<00:01:23.939> from<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> outside

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the heats going to move from the outside

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
the heats going to move from the outside
to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> center<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.009> gonna<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to the center and so it's gonna take a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.700 
to the center and so it's gonna take a

my grill is as hot as it goes I've let

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
my grill is as hot as it goes I've let
it<00:02:12.989> preheat<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.290> about<00:02:13.530> 20

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it preheat for about 20

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760 
it preheat for about 20
25<00:02:14.340> minutes<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.850> while<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.930> fact<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.290> this

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
25 minutes and while the fact that this

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.320 
25 minutes and while the fact that this
steak<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.220> actually<00:02:17.430> small<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.210> about

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
steak is actually small this is about

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.660 
steak is actually small this is about
half<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.630> pound<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> pound<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.100> because

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
half a pound this is a pound but because

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
half a pound this is a pound but because
it<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.090> thicker<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.630> about<00:02:21.720> half<00:02:21.990> an<00:02:22.140> inch<00:02:22.260> or

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
it is thicker it's about half an inch or

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.080 
it is thicker it's about half an inch or
so<00:02:22.440> thicker<00:02:22.860> we're<00:02:23.460> going<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.640> start<00:02:23.970> with

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
so thicker we're going to start with

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
so thicker we're going to start with
this<00:02:24.300> one<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.560> them<00:02:25.710> done<00:02:25.950> at

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
this one so that I can get them done at

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.830 
this one so that I can get them done at
the<00:02:26.340> same<00:02:26.550> time<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.330> not<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.660> about<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the same time it's not really about the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.330 
the same time it's not really about the
total<00:02:28.080> weight<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.950> thickness<00:02:29.160> of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
total weight it's about the thickness of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.980 
total weight it's about the thickness of
the<00:02:29.490> steak<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.300> we're<00:02:30.390> gonna<00:02:30.480> start<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:30.960> our
