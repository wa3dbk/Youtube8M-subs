00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.360
 because that's there because there's there 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.380
 of course, I have to say that thing , yes, what 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 I should say to that you all know 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.660
 exactly what the update is about 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.129
 since it's outside how can it all 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.460
 already play since a felt 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.720
 hours at the alb or 2 i got myself 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.919
 Now the video decided to do it 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.939
 fast upload I guess I think 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.039
 maybe a second 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.560
 thalhofer in the second part of the bookshop 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.640
 there is the thing and there it turns 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.140
 He now looks down into the water 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.489
 loaded but as we are used to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.379
 we have to wait a bit 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.550
 until the servers are finished waiting for that 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.719
 means are these first short 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.519
 error message and then it worked too 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.289
 I have to say very quickly 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.120
 how the giants complimented 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.160
 superfast in contrast to the first 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.829
 few times now for the last two 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.780
 Let's do it right again 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.859
 fast but a little bit no 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.500
 Thoughts are the updates 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.210
 ratzfatz unlocked downloaded 10 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.079
 15 minutes later the servers are ready 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.999
 Wait and then we start 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.170
 that was really one of those 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.089
 a few things make me feel very happy again 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 But we were happy about this update 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.670
 otherwise I do not know now I hope 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.369
 most of them have seen the video 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.180
 me to change.org about this move 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.170
 said I wrote 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.850
 I've recorded how 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.750
 even if I am the link again 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.369
 and in the description would me 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.320
 really huge huge huge huge 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.119
 happy if I look at that helps too 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.860
 just so on and so on 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.250
 thought comes we print it out 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.420
 in came past has jorge yes his 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.439
 retirement announced so thought 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.079
 I still have nothing definite 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.820
 but fought really here once in 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.619
 the first few minutes not really 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.420
 a lot to see or 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.369
 nothing I do not know if I just 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.630
 was faster than him and because of that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.070
 Let's wait a bit more 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.530
 but not one this smaller today 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.759
 for the quite in this category 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.420
 worst worst bad bad 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.890
 well and yes as I said for me that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.409
 only thing that really came new 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.140
 is actually the point that I am now 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.830
 yes what here exactly clear to troops 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.380
 request with 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.030
 a cd so it's all the same 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.000
 only a troop can make a request where 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.280
 i can write in what units 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.470
 I would like to have in this request 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.730
 besides, we can request troops 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.110
 accelerate now and you 're completely in 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.700
 seriously it is not your serious to fit 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.080
 I also wanted to have money for it 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.570
 that the us troops request faster 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.010
 can take as 20 minutes as if he 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.660
 Do not earn enough money like that already 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.330
 but here we see another 32 million 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.430
 3.2 million costs the spell 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.040
 factory at level 5 so we switch 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.780
 then this fabled fries magic 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.890
 free meanwhile, look at me now 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 I have someone else now 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.320
 short the magic spell I changed 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.320
 always said 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.630
 the barely changed look now times 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.030
 here at pan darius russia or pen 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.959
 darius yes again over whether you 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.459
 already something is not yet 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.540
 really as far as I can tell 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.770
 no no no at most the peka peka 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.840
 whatever stage four 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.830
 but otherwise I do not see anything here 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.660
 somehow it always gets overseas 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.580
 confusing he builds her 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.930
 Dark Elixir Drill is on it 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.519
 I also do not know exactly 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.200
 why he's out sports now so here 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.860
 Once the troop request has happened 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.660
 yes I would like three and can 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.600
 all pure stakes smileys even go 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:38.070
 in this thing, therefore, from man 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.070
 that this ipad is always my goodness 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.640
 as has just york fits in quite well 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.090
 the one theme 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.160
 tweeted that he was his colleague 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.140
 kemmer the customer service but also 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.550
 you see, you also bring them 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.840
 functions you now have this broad 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.120
 with 19 minutes above it 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.820
 the theme of the first is one with 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.680
 maximized base and i want to be honest 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.600
 Did not know how much he said for that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.890
 how much that has been paid is incredible 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.510
 but we'll get there soon 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.830
 I have another picture for you so 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.850
 otherwise we see here now 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.640
 change over again and then you are 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.630
 we come back to my level 55 he comes 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.789
 and if it all asks again 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.620
 how come I can do one 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.470
 second account have the link to that 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.000
 video namely that he 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.190
 He is below in the description of her 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 just needs two ios devices 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.530
 so yes if you see this one you can see this 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.760
 liquid like these windows too 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.440
 need that is the only thing too 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.660
 still really cool the performance 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.900
 is just really fast as fast 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.950
 that loads everything here is definitely 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.690
 improved 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.250
 You can tell that right when you have the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.140
 open the window and close and here 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.150
 Above all this is a fight looking 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.010
 it's going to be really fluent again 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.690
 Liquid these clouds go away like 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.940
 quickly I find someone new again 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.960
 that graz graz now has one me 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.700
 do not even have one 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.710
 fast derivative just but that is 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.180
 really really good but that 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.340
 I really like it that way 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.860
 is more fluid and also the 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.490
 Writing is much finer and much more 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.470
 more beautiful 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.620
 such a long hype but to 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.210
 trinket spell factory stage 5 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.190
 here we see the first to this 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.800
 time I found in the 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.640
 Topliste otherwise has the synonymous 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.010
 not really no, nothing else usually 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.620
 and then we're here at clayton 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.560
 Clayton already has the first walls up 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.380
 Stage 11 and there we also see that the 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.150
 underpin 7,000 rebounds not tolerate such 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.550
 I suspected I had something with 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.630
 6000 but there are 7000 from one 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.810
 a bit here in his whole 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.630
 He's over there now 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.020
 just for the magic spell 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.130
 factory started at level five 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.080
 otherwise he is not like that yet 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.430
 really, that does not mean much 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.220
 of course, also neater 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.450
 spend more schmidiger but at least already 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.710
 a little bit so now we see here 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.919
 again with emmen the first cholera often 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:04.250
 get the first pk on stage 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:06.800
 5 and again nonsense tells 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.610
 Of course I would be good enough 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.300
 picture has also changed a bit 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.410
 otherwise changes the miniature view 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.820
 strong is that all I can unfortunately 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.500
 not yet say at this time 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.630
 I have not found anything home yet 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.700
 but I'll sure times the walls 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.020
 wall so I have to stand diagonally 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.729
 even if he at least the 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.200
 optics looks very different because flowers are so 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.470
 a little bit over it is all one 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.280
 bit finer and more beautiful 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.620
 besides, of course we see he has 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.610
 his entire camp is already at 8 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.470
 and has already completed the third 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.169
 hidden so as carbonate 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.570
 he was 31 star and at that time 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.250
 has also been the first to substantiate 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.960
 Stage 11 from a boat to the ex arc 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.440
 and he was the first one I found 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.660
 have 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.850
 came with 12 worse with it 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.070
 never do that any harm of 86 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.960
 we know that now too and otherwise 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.720
 the army warehouse at level eight is now 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.880
 almost forgot was enlarged by 5 that 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.400
 means before you had a capacity 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.560
 from 225 and now there are 20 again 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:11.000
 come to that right now there is 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:13.850
 a total capacity of 245 for even 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.169
 It was that every 4 years at the age of eight 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.990
 actually already from the first one 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.669
 follow there is the thing here you still see 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.949
 times the maximized base you can 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:27.979
 you just look at kemmer clear yet 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:31.310
 44 yes, I 'm not saying anything at all 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:32.750
 beautiful is definitely something else well me 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.849
 I hope the video liked that anyway 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.500
 and yes I will be second part 1 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.720
 Of course a second part raushauen 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.889
 as soon as I know more, and until then will 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.110
 Of course, have a nice day 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.110
 and good night
