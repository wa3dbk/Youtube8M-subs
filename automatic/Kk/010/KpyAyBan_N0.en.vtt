kitchen aid as well and you want to make
sure<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> kitchenaid<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.840> use<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
sure on the kitchenaid that you use this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.139 
sure on the kitchenaid that you use this
attachment<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.579> which<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> called<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
attachment here which is called the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
attachment here which is called the
paddle<00:00:36.690> attachment<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
paddle attachment so what we're going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.400 
paddle attachment so what we're going to
do<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> take<00:00:39.570> our<00:00:39.629> sugar<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
do is we're going to take our sugar and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.680 
do is we're going to take our sugar and
we're<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> put<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> bowl<00:00:41.700> just

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
we're going to put it in the bowl just

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.080 
we're going to put it in the bowl just
like<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:44.309> then<00:00:44.700> we're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> add

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
like that and then we're going to add

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
like that and then we're going to add
our<00:00:45.180> one-third<00:00:45.840> cup<00:00:46.079> molasses<00:00:46.739> pour<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.160> all

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
our one-third cup molasses pour it all

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.029 
our one-third cup molasses pour it all
the<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:49.079> idea<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the way in and a good idea is to use a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.970 
the way in and a good idea is to use a
spatula<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
spatula that way you can get all the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
spatula that way you can get all the
molasses<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> container<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
molasses out of the container there so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.770 
molasses out of the container there so
going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.110> ahead<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.780> we're

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
going to go ahead and do that and we're

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
going to go ahead and do that and we're
going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.930> set<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:58.920> we're

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
going to set that in and then we're

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.830 
going to set that in and then we're
going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.789> ahead<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.090> put<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.329> medium

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
going to go ahead and put our medium

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.549 
going to go ahead and put our medium
speed<00:01:02.300> anyone<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> let<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.140> go<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.500> about

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
speed anyone want to let it go for about

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310 
speed anyone want to let it go for about
four<00:01:05.100> minutes

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.380 

and<00:01:08.800> if<00:01:08.980> you<00:01:09.070> notice<00:01:09.280> when<00:01:09.730> you're<00:01:09.880> doing<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
and if you notice when you're doing it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.820 
and if you notice when you're doing it
you<00:01:10.510> make<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> little<00:01:10.990> bit<00:01:11.170> molasses<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
you make it a little bit molasses on the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.440 
you make it a little bit molasses on the
side<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.280> bowl<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.909> can<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.150> go<00:01:13.330> ahead

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
side of the bowl you can just go ahead

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.969 
side of the bowl you can just go ahead
and<00:01:13.600> stop<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.530> then<00:01:15.010> just<00:01:15.120> scrape<00:01:16.120> it<00:01:16.300> down

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and stop it and then just scrape it down

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.260 
and stop it and then just scrape it down
and<00:01:17.979> we're<00:01:18.160> almost<00:01:18.310> done<00:01:18.729> here<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.150> is

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
and we're almost done here this is

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.690 
and we're almost done here this is
looking<00:01:19.540> great<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.200> go<00:01:21.070> ahead<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.430> just<00:01:21.520> keep

looking great and go ahead and just keep
it<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:21.940> medium<00:01:22.150> speed<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.540> you'll<00:01:25.810> never<00:01:25.930> have

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
it on medium speed and you'll never have

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.160 
it on medium speed and you'll never have
to<00:01:26.260> buy<00:01:26.470> brown<00:01:26.740> sugar<00:01:27.100> again<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:31.690> if<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.020> get
