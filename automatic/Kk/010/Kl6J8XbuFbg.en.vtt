00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 Wide sleeve sleeves patterns coat 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.719
 poncho sleeve sleeve kimono sleeve layer the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.450
 layer sleeve can be cut to the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 length you want the amplitude of the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.980
 bottom edge hangs freely without 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.980
 no gather the hem sewn 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 using the appropriate point type cut 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 of the sleeve layer cuts a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 reproduction of the straight sleeve of the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 base pattern of the length you need 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.810
 fold the sheet in four in direction 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 longitudinal open and cut along 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.670
 of the folds place the pattern on 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.559
 another sheet of paper separating its pieces 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.260
 uniformly to obtain the width 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.440
 that you want in the lower part keep 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.910
 together the pieces on top 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.370
 trace again the top of the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 Sleeve shaped curved line eliminating 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.989
 thus the angles that form the unions 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.969
 of the pieces you add two centimeters 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 for margin seams in that part and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.410
 in the side lines you add a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 centimeter on the bottom edge for the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.449
 rolled hem points the address 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 of the thread of the fabric the tip of the shoulder 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.320
 and the marks and pickets of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.490
 correspondence 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.800
 cut the new poncho sleeve pattern equal 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.600
 that the sleeve kimono the shape of the sleeve 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.910
 Poncho is obtained by expanding the yoke 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.300
 from the shoulder and the waist can 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.640
 top it with hem or with back 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.440
 sleeve cut poncho places the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.360
 pieces of yoke on another sheet of 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.210
 paper so that the tips coincide 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.330
 of the neckline lights the pieces in this 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.220
 position draws a straight line forming 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.430
 a right angle with the rear center 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.750
 from the point of union of the necklines 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.180
 prolong this line to length 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.850
 chosen without forgetting to add the length 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.530
 of the shoulder draws the curved line that 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.350
 will form the lower edge of the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.360
 This sleeve should connect the lines of 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.970
 the waist of both youngers as a sample 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.009
 the illustration you add two centimeters 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 all around for the margins of the 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.920
 seams draws the thread of the fabric to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.119
 length of the posterior center line 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.830
 reproduces the marks and pickets of 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 correspondence and trims the new 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.489
 Kimono sleeve pattern this wide sleeve is 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.540
 cut in the same piece of the yoke 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.480
 continuing the lines of the shoulder and of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.760
 down the arm to the fist 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.970
 the result is a yoke with something of 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.730
 shape and wide sleeves and loose cut 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.530
 the kimono sleeve you put the back of the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.319
 base pattern yoke on a sheet 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.260
 large paper marks the tip of the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.290
 shoulder and the fist to point the point 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.580
 Ba 4 centimeters from a forming angle 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.340
 straight knows a bird does traces a 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.129
 line to 10 2 centimeters should it form 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.709
 right angle with bc points d in the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.690
 end of this line measures four 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.720
 centimeters from the bottom point 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.519
 of the armhole and I pointed out that at this point 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.640
 one of with hey tracas then one 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.160
 curve between the yoke and the sleeve measures 21 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.099
 5 centimeters from must on the line 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.069
 abc draws a line that forms an angle 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.750
 straight with bc until you get to leave this is 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.599
 the line that indicates the three quarters 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.370
 parts of the sleeve draws the forwards 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.010
 of the yoke and the sleeve in the same way 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.930
 makes extend the widest part of the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.500
 pince to place it just below the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.030
 original but without moving its tip points 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.100
 the direction of the fabric thread in the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.440
 front and back of 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.150
 and reproduces all the marks and pickets 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.170
 of correspondence and cut the new 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.000
 pattern we end the article 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.910
 If you need to listen to me again, give 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.910
 play as many times as you want thanks
