this<00:00:07.200> quick<00:00:07.410> video<00:00:07.680> I'll<00:00:08.040> show<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.280> some<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
this quick video I'll show you some of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.450 
this quick video I'll show you some of
the<00:00:08.790> differences<00:00:09.240> between<00:00:09.300> both<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> devices

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
the differences between both the devices

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.860 
the differences between both the devices
regarding<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.700> screen<00:00:12.150> size<00:00:12.389> both<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
regarding the the screen size both of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.620 
regarding the the screen size both of
them<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> quad<00:00:13.620> HD<00:00:13.830> screen<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
them have a quad HD screen and that is a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.800 
them have a quad HD screen and that is a
5.7<00:00:16.199> inch<00:00:16.730> display<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:17.760> again<00:00:18.150> you'll<00:00:18.480> notice

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
5.7 inch display but again you'll notice

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.560 
5.7 inch display but again you'll notice
immediately<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.619> then<00:00:20.130> note<00:00:20.400> 4<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.090> slightly

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
immediately that then note 4 is slightly

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.000 
immediately that then note 4 is slightly
wider<00:00:22.220> whereas<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:24.060> note<00:00:24.330> 5<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.830> its

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
wider whereas the note 5 because of its

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.370 
wider whereas the note 5 because of its
thinner<00:00:26.340> bezels<00:00:26.820> looks<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.260> bit

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
thinner bezels looks a little bit

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.130 
thinner bezels looks a little bit
slimmer<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.039> would<00:00:29.340> say<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.880> terms<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.480> weight<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
slimmer I would say in terms of weight I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
slimmer I would say in terms of weight I
would<00:00:31.289> say<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> weight<00:00:32.189> difference<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
would say that the weight difference is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.830 
would say that the weight difference is
not<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.020> note<00:00:34.380> 5<00:00:34.680> ways<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.840> 171

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
not that much the note 5 ways just 171

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.770 
not that much the note 5 ways just 171
grams<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> note<00:00:38.070> 2<00:00:38.340> 5<00:00:38.640> feels<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.270> lot<00:00:39.450> more

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
grams but the note 2 5 feels a lot more

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
grams but the note 2 5 feels a lot more
dense<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.829> build<00:00:41.190> quality<00:00:41.309> has<00:00:41.820> changed

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
dense the build quality has changed

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
dense the build quality has changed
considerably<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.290> fact<00:00:44.010> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
considerably in fact if you look at the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.389 
considerably in fact if you look at the
back<00:00:44.969> you'll<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.960> huge<00:00:46.230> difference<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
back you'll see the huge difference the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.880 
back you'll see the huge difference the
note<00:00:47.640> 4<00:00:47.910> had<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> fake<00:00:48.719> leather<00:00:49.230> which

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
note 4 had this fake leather which

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
note 4 had this fake leather which
actually<00:00:50.489> gave<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.360> good<00:00:51.629> grip<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
actually gave it a very good grip and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
actually gave it a very good grip and
also<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:53.010> terms<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> fingerprint<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> was

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
also in terms of fingerprint it was

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
also in terms of fingerprint it was
fingerprint<00:00:54.870> friendly<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
fingerprint friendly but that's not the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
fingerprint friendly but that's not the
case<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> note<00:00:57.210> 5<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.410> back<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.829> also

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
case with the note 5 the back is also

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
case with the note 5 the back is also
glass<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> Gorilla<00:01:00.090> Glass<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
glass this is Gorilla Glass and it's a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
glass this is Gorilla Glass and it's a
fingerprint<00:01:02.219> magnet<00:01:02.760> also<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.379> not

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
fingerprint magnet also the back is not

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.750 
fingerprint magnet also the back is not
user<00:01:04.890> replaceable

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
user replaceable

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
user replaceable
unlike<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> note<00:01:07.049> 4<00:01:07.320> where<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.830> easily

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
unlike the note 4 where you can easily

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.570 
unlike the note 4 where you can easily
pop<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> access<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.680> internals

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
pop this out and access the internals

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
pop this out and access the internals
like<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.030> battery<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.869> example<00:01:13.380> let<00:01:13.799> me<00:01:13.830> show

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
like the battery for example let me show

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
like the battery for example let me show
you<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.270> take<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you you can just take this out on the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.140 
you you can just take this out on the
note<00:01:16.259> 4<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.400> access<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
note 4 and you have the access to the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.380 
note 4 and you have the access to the
battery<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.920> microSD<00:01:20.520> card<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.150> sadly

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
battery and your microSD card but sadly

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
battery and your microSD card but sadly
those<00:01:22.020> things<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.530> simply<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
those things are simply not there on the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
those things are simply not there on the
note<00:01:24.570> 5<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.500> battery<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> sealed<00:01:26.340> inside

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
note 5 the battery is sealed inside

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.480 
note 5 the battery is sealed inside
which<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> 3000<00:01:27.689> milliamp<00:01:27.900> hour<00:01:28.290> battery

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
which is a 3000 milliamp hour battery

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
which is a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:30.180> slightly<00:01:30.329> lower

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
which is actually slightly lower

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.899 
which is actually slightly lower
compared<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> note<00:01:32.460> 4

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
compared to the note 4

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.510 
compared to the note 4
for<00:01:33.270> example<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.900> note<00:01:34.500> 4<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:35.430> having<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
for example this note 4 was having a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
for example this note 4 was having a
3200<00:01:38.520> 20<00:01:38.880> milliamp<00:01:39.329> hour<00:01:39.509> battery<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
3200 20 milliamp hour battery and the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.980 
3200 20 milliamp hour battery and the
biggest<00:01:40.619> Commission<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.329> note<00:01:42.750> 5

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
biggest Commission is that this note 5

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.179 
biggest Commission is that this note 5
does<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:44.540> micro<00:01:45.540> SD<00:01:45.869> card<00:01:46.110> slot

another thing that I have noticed is
that<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> top<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.140> notice<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.680> 3.5<00:01:59.399> mm

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that on the top if you notice the 3.5 mm

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
that on the top if you notice the 3.5 mm
headphone<00:02:00.030> jack<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.049> top<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> note

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
headphone jack is on the top on the note

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.149 
headphone jack is on the top on the note
4<00:02:01.890> whereas<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.750> headphone<00:02:04.259> jack<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.680> at<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
4 whereas the headphone jack is at the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.029 
4 whereas the headphone jack is at the
bottom<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> note<00:02:06.570> 5<00:02:06.869> also<00:02:07.409> one<00:02:07.619> more<00:02:07.770> thing

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
bottom on the note 5 also one more thing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.070 
bottom on the note 5 also one more thing
that<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.399> noticed<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.929> not

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that I have noticed is that we do not

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
that I have noticed is that we do not
have<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> IR<00:02:10.739> blaster<00:02:10.770> which<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.520> found<00:02:11.730> on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
have the IR blaster which we found on

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.460 
have the IR blaster which we found on
the<00:02:12.060> note<00:02:12.300> 4<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.200> new

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the note 4 on the new

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.010 
the note 4 on the new
that's<00:02:14.070> simply<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.460> there<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.600> actually

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
that's simply not there this is actually

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.400 
that's simply not there this is actually
the<00:02:16.230> same<00:02:16.950> slot<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> nano-sim<00:02:18.570> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the same slot that is the nano-sim so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.740 
the same slot that is the nano-sim so
again<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> sin<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.370> also<00:02:20.550> different<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.570> we

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
again the sin is also different here we

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500 
again the sin is also different here we
had<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> micro-sim<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.830> now<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.880> note<00:02:24.060> 5<00:02:24.300> we

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
had a micro-sim and now on the note 5 we

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.960 
had a micro-sim and now on the note 5 we
have<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> nano-sim<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.130> placement<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
have a nano-sim the placement of the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.570 
have a nano-sim the placement of the
power<00:02:27.210> button<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.810> similar<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:28.920> again<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
power button is similar but again the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.150 
power button is similar but again the
note<00:02:30.030> five<00:02:30.300> feels<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.870> bit<00:02:31.140> slimmer<00:02:31.560> due

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
note five feels a little bit slimmer due

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.600 
note five feels a little bit slimmer due
to<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.460> tapered<00:02:33.270> down<00:02:33.450> design<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
to that tapered down design and on the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.730 
to that tapered down design and on the
bottom<00:02:35.970> again<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.570> quite<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.470> of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
bottom again we see quite a bit of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.220 
bottom again we see quite a bit of
differences<00:02:38.520> let<00:02:38.670> me<00:02:38.820> actually<00:02:39.000> show<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.690> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
differences let me actually show you and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.800 
differences let me actually show you and
here<00:02:41.040> as<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.520> again<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
here as you can see again we have the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.590 
here as you can see again we have the
s-pen<00:02:43.470> that's<00:02:43.950> at<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.520> same<00:02:44.790> slot<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.330> again

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
s-pen that's at the same slot but again

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.020 
s-pen that's at the same slot but again
on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> note<00:02:46.200> 5<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> pop<00:02:47.010> type<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.850> just

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
on the note 5 it's the pop type you just

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.150 
on the note 5 it's the pop type you just
press<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> button<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.440> need<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.860> actually

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
press a button here you need to actually

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.910 
press a button here you need to actually
pull<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.140> speaker<00:02:52.709> here

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
pull it out and we have the speaker here

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
pull it out and we have the speaker here
at<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.370> bottom<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:55.290> 3.5<00:02:56.280> mm<00:02:56.670> headphone

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
at the bottom and the 3.5 mm headphone

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.260 
at the bottom and the 3.5 mm headphone
jack<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.900> volume<00:02:58.080> rockers<00:02:58.920> are<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.520> same

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
jack the volume rockers are on the same

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.300 
jack the volume rockers are on the same
side<00:03:00.660> regarding<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> processor<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
side regarding the processor the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.490 
side regarding the processor the
internals<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:02.910> changed<00:03:03.540> now<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.959> would<00:03:04.380> say

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
internals have changed now I would say

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.010 
internals have changed now I would say
the<00:03:04.620> note<00:03:04.890> 5<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.370> very<00:03:05.610> similar<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.840> same

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
the note 5 is very similar to the same

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.860 
the note 5 is very similar to the same
processor<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.620> we<00:03:07.800> got<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> s6<00:03:08.940> that's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
processor that we got on the s6 that's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.690 
processor that we got on the s6 that's
the<00:03:10.160> Exynos<00:03:11.900> 7<00:03:12.900> 4<00:03:13.110> 2<00:03:13.320> 0<00:03:13.350> that's<00:03:14.130> an<00:03:14.310> octa-core

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the Exynos 7 4 2 0 that's an octa-core

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.850 
the Exynos 7 4 2 0 that's an octa-core
processor<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.600> regarding<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> RAM<00:03:16.500> also

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
processor and regarding the RAM also

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.979 
processor and regarding the RAM also
we've<00:03:17.010> got<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> bump<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.330> note<00:03:18.540> 5<00:03:18.780> we

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
we've got a bump here on the note 5 we

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.310 
we've got a bump here on the note 5 we
have<00:03:19.200> 4<00:03:19.470> gigabytes<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.070> RAM<00:03:20.310> whereas<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
have 4 gigabytes of RAM whereas on the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.729 
have 4 gigabytes of RAM whereas on the
note<00:03:22.320> 4<00:03:22.350> we<00:03:22.860> had<00:03:23.070> 3<00:03:23.489> gigabytes<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:24.090> RAM<00:03:24.739> so

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
note 4 we had 3 gigabytes of RAM so

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.920 
note 4 we had 3 gigabytes of RAM so
these<00:03:26.190> are<00:03:26.430> some<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> differences<00:03:27.510> again

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
these are some of the differences again

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.680 
these are some of the differences again
