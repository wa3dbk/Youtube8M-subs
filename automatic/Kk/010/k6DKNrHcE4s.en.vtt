00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.270
 So let's do the November issue 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.270
 write 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.400
 Will change 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.890
 Yes Nan 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.760
 I will explain points 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:46.400
 Hallucinations 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.400
 I will firmly tighten 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.830
 Bouncing and put it from the Gu' the lateral force 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.980
 When 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:02.130
 Joe is careful of writing order 12 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:06.980
 I write properly and it will change in different ways 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.860
 If you draw a line, it almost fits here 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.050
 If this goes down under 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.260
 I say it's not very cool 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.630
 Right 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.959
 Maintenance 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.850
 It's a single layer, so always adjust the line 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.850
 Then Tennen large medium and small 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.370
 Sermon Board of éš¹ 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:32.090
 I wrote that I said sideways 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.569
 Align 93 books and then make it last good 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.740
 Then I try to tighten my ears 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:44.580
 In addition, I also extended this long 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:46.490
 You can see the house tightened by the fact that the side is starting to grow by 9 steps 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.980
 Keep child 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.120
 Well I 'm not so pimp but I feel here 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.980
 It combined in a stuffed Once packed it is that so much that match 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.980
 When it opens it says that it is vacant 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.860
 I'm waiting 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.470
 Right 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.280
 A fair game of cat 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.610
 It is a hand that has already been shown 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.430
 And its 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.580
 I think that this angle may be slightly different 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.509
 then 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.400
 I pay here and get rid of here 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.910
 It's about this time 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.360
 You're in the end is firmly 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.360
 Something 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.430
 I want a state 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.870
 The thickest part of the outside line has arrived 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.400
 is not it 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.699
 I guess I Hiragana was Hatada 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.699
 ing 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:53.409
 Here is the center of Marukot 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:57.599
 If the place where you turn is almost hit at the center and this is composed 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.599
 It will be a little cool 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.590
 Oh, after all you think that solder is all right 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.590
 Yes it is
