00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.140
 oie 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 outer 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900
 thou 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:23.010
 Fellow James Sue Hi I greet you for a long time Yes Sir Danger is Lee Jun 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 I will try to start the four classical guitar classes from today's one 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 The first lesson was taught a class once for ticks and other names and structures 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.530
 I'll try. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.680
 The classical guitar that you see right now, 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.020
 And 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:50.560
 Nackfadi is divided into three big parts. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:53.260
 Literally now divided into three parts: head, neck and body 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.020
 I'll take a look at the gel head. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 Go to the wrong line with the line. 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:05.619
 The rear to the back so that the freckles and as ever sees 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.030
 Three of three sides 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:17.440
 The head and the line also talk about the head machine error 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 Now here is the second part of the nut is a nut that connects to the powers and H. Nack part 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:26.290
 Now, in expensive guitars, the ion is not a regular plastic 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.700
 I use it as a good material, 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:36.940
 At the pitch of the guitar or at the tension part of the string below 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.690
 2 The quality difference that the nut r haejugo the important role of the expected sound 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:45.010
 I have. 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:49.360
 If you look at the balance, 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:55.150
 This is called a fixed portion that is fresh, not what Brett flash fret 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.400
 By one of the three pools Freddie flat part equally with the full name of the 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:04.119
 I'm sick and I'm sick. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:06.299
 Then look at the body side as well as all the ventilation fights Hall here 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.390
 Now when I hit the guitar 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.030
 The sound hole part 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.430
 As you can see, it's on the inside. 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:24.490
 Well, lastly, this part of the story tells us why Bryce plays such a bridge. 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:28.240
 Guitar strings and guitar , the connection of the legs, 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:34.959
 There is no big difference, but now a little 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:40.690
 Now it is my part as a grip doing what ccf 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.690
 v Shape This left hand grip is a classic sense of gravity when gripped 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.640
 As you can see, 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.820
 There's a little more room in the shaded area. 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.660
 The big difference between Tong - 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.140
 Part of the fingerboard is a big difference. 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.220
 This classical guitar that I have now has an authentic classical guitar 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.900
 incorrectly 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:09.600
 It's the age of the hike. Yeah, I 'm going to cycle to recording 0. 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.600
 Now when the high seven solo part 5 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.030
 Seven solos in the top 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.430
 Something to make you feel good . 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:29.940
 Deep as if such status is in this shape and 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:33.400
 Name largely into three parts, I'm in the middle of the nut frets that fights stones 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:39.240
 Bridge Head Machine 4 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:42.890
 At this level, the other names have been finalized and the beginning of this guitar 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.890
 Let's go to the posture once. 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.890
 U 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.830
 you 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.520
 theo juice woo
