 won the victory immediately on 80 samurai 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.469
 can imagine too saying no 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.369
 do it but also when despise rush 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:13.270
 on a bullshit working out simple blows 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:18.119
 every day until just three hits but very 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.049
 much power well and shavkat us when 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.069

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:27.959
 how to run into a simple and from the beginning 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:31.060
 fields and before sunset 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.340
 make dart dart today we 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.619
 put such an experiment that I 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.859
 try to work at 10,000 strokes per 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.859
 day 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.170
 to make a pear than the seemingly 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.510
 paw or on the air 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.759
 how about grief again is not important 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.240
 how do you nag important principle 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.440
 how do you participate in this process 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.570
 the main thing in the process of training and 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.220
 developments in general any skill any 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.490
 skills in his understanding of this calm 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.539
 calm concentration and attention three 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.630
 basic principles 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:17.989
 but in principle we begin well that we start here 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.730
 we started the morning warm up was with 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:31.010
 a log and a kick i mean i will 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:32.780
 work out just a blow goes still emotions 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:40.850
 that is important attention concentration as 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:43.640
 how to emit not, but were how to work 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.209
 it is concentration focused attention 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.209
 calmly 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.160
 now 8200 to be honest and have hands 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.160
 wadded ones did not break up 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.000
 such an interesting state as it seems like 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.489
 in the fog some meditation like that 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.070
 there is a principle obtained in addition to operating time 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.040
 the very same for now there is a hit in some 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.660
 such condition 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.800
 it's hard to explain everything is heard differently 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.410
 see here the feeling is so brighter 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.750
 so nothing surprising there is that 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.240
 turn out such in the number of strokes 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.940
 it is simply the most important and when in 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.580
 frame, even if you just spend your 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.700
 I can not get completely different 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.160
 state of consciousness and he also spoke 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.140
 such interesting things that you were asked 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.890
 so training gives strength 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.840
 don't like to not give strength training 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.820
 knock out crap out of my head when very 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.100
 do well and passed in to enter 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.290
 barrier can't and develops will 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.290
 and here is when it's only 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:17.960
 Well, our experiment was over 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.260
 10,000 even beats got so interesting 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.030
 the sensation burns all that is shoulders and chest 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.940
 with pin 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.960
 Well, in general, that is all and such a state 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.960
 of fog 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.660
 Something in this is see of course how 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.900
 impact will be then we all get 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.540
 abruptly brought work patience will 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.610
 right caste with the same way you can in 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.620
 another area dice at least horizontal 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.920
 WSI ICs street workout earn infinite 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.350
 number of times 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.750
 wear say coming back because 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.820
 I can't break it through 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.190
 discomfort is important even for at least one 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.490
 time for a grant to do so here 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.930
 training that is, it gives an extension with 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.470
 one side is your consciousness 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.180
 Opportunity still such an interesting moment 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.470
 how does the trump how to work out and 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.060
 blows to pears gnaw 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.550
 beauty beauty beauty you became your hands 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.240
 descend there comes more enemies 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.070
 imagine 99 again go in tibet 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.890
 then still comes all of you are already lying 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.390
 stand up can't come in here the most 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.800
 main enemy no need to get up in the addresses 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.550
 if you have at least one workout 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.990
 spend you very much understand well in 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.390
 basically we finish this 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.280
 the experiment, that is, showed that it 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.530
 something very so powerful load 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:45.290
 as a psychological attack physical and 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:47.180
 moral and think what is useful 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.550
 do and so can be achieved 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.080
 great results we naturally need 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.230
 to approach everything 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.260
 here it is to break through my feeling i don't 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.390
 can it help that is and when are you talking about 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.410
 footman can it brings will probably 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:06.410
 it is important i think so but also so we complete 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.350
 we naturally tea such training with 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.500
 rosehip honey may still be 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.620
 best of all baldezh came to the more 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:20.270
 fresh air in the Crimea such peace to all 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:23.620
 the bomb just you all until the next meeting 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.620
 the following experiments force
