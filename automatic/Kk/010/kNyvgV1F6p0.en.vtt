North<00:02:19.810> America<00:02:20.290> these<00:02:21.160> are<00:02:21.550> probably<00:02:21.970> just

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
North America these are probably just

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.199 
North America these are probably just
for<00:02:22.390> Europe<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.459> see<00:02:24.640> something<00:02:25.090> like

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
