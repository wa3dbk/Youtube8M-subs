garden and I think you can see I've got

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.380 
garden and I think you can see I've got
it<00:00:21.050> pretty<00:00:22.050> well<00:00:22.380> tension<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.150> say

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it pretty well tension now but like say

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.679 
it pretty well tension now but like say
I've<00:00:24.480> been<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:24.900> quite<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.230> while<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
I've been at it for quite a while and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.979 
I've been at it for quite a while and
both<00:00:27.689> ends<00:00:28.490> finally<00:00:29.900> nice<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.170> talent<00:00:32.989> couple

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
both ends finally nice the talent couple

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.310 
both ends finally nice the talent couple
things<00:00:34.790> when<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> put<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> orb<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.719> found

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
things when you put in the orb I found

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.790 
things when you put in the orb I found
that<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.070> pole<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.090> single<00:00:39.660> pole<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.170> goes

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that the pole the single pole that goes

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
that the pole the single pole that goes
all<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.070> way<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.180> best<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> put<00:00:43.079> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
all the way over is best if you put it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410 
all the way over is best if you put it
in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> second<00:00:43.860> outer<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.579> outer<00:00:44.730> islet<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
in the second outer the outer islet of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.799 
in the second outer the outer islet of
the<00:00:45.600> band<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.129> band<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.809> I've

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the band there of that band and I've

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.380 
the band there of that band and I've
done<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> other<00:00:49.320> side<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.829> well<00:00:50.390> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
done it on the other side as well so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.590 
done it on the other side as well so
it's<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:53.129> outside<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.210> band<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
it's just on the outside the band and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's just on the outside the band and
then<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.190> wiggle

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
then you just a little bit of a wiggle

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
then you just a little bit of a wiggle
to<00:00:59.210> get<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> tension<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.379> doesn't<00:01:01.680> flap

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to get it tension so it doesn't flap

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
to get it tension so it doesn't flap
it's<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> flap<00:01:03.300> too<00:01:03.629> much<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it's not going to flap too much on the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
it's not going to flap too much on the
bottom<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
bottom I don't think the one thing that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
bottom I don't think the one thing that
isn't<00:01:07.830> quite<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:08.760> things<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.150> didn't

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
isn't quite the two things I didn't

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.980 
isn't quite the two things I didn't
quite<00:01:09.600> realize<00:01:10.010> is<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.310> whilst<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.390> inner

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
quite realize is that whilst the inner

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.940 
quite realize is that whilst the inner
is<00:01:13.170> attached<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.890> outer<00:01:16.890> tent

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
is attached to the outer tent

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.090 
is attached to the outer tent
it's<00:01:19.759> not<00:01:19.969> attached<00:01:20.360> in<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.780> corners<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.950> each

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it's not attached in the corners so each

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.609 
it's not attached in the corners so each
corner<00:01:22.520> here<00:01:23.950> needs<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.100> be<00:01:25.780> pulled<00:01:26.780> out<00:01:27.049> and

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
corner here needs to be pulled out and

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.260 
corner here needs to be pulled out and
I'm<00:01:27.740> supposing<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:30.579> it's<00:01:31.579> linked<00:01:31.969> on<00:01:32.119> this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
I'm supposing that it's linked on this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.080 
I'm supposing that it's linked on this
one<00:01:32.899> peg<00:01:33.229> with<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.590> outer<00:01:33.970> obviously<00:01:34.970> I'll

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
one peg with the outer obviously I'll

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.899 
one peg with the outer obviously I'll
get<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.950> more<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> practice<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.610> better<00:01:37.700> it

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
get this more a practice the better it

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.210 
get this more a practice the better it
will<00:01:37.970> become<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> there's<00:01:39.679> one<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.069> each

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
will become so there's one on each

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.429 
will become so there's one on each
corner<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.659> one<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.899> them<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:42.259> two<00:01:42.409> on

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
corner it's one of them and it's two on

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.609 
corner it's one of them and it's two on
the<00:01:42.590> other<00:01:42.740> side<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.069> well<00:01:43.280> now<00:01:44.210> then<00:01:44.509> well<00:01:45.469> the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
the other side as well now then well the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.279 
the other side as well now then well the
second<00:01:46.069> big<00:01:46.219> thing<00:01:46.490> for<00:01:46.520> me<00:01:46.789> is<00:01:46.969> this<00:01:47.600> pole<00:01:48.020> at

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
second big thing for me is this pole at

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.130 
second big thing for me is this pole at
the<00:01:48.319> end<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.539> this<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:50.719> going<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.899> be<00:01:50.959> right

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
the end and this is going to be right

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.620 
the end and this is going to be right
old<00:01:51.409> tie<00:01:51.860> because<00:01:52.310> if<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.209> don't<00:01:53.330> get<00:01:53.539> it

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
old tie because if you don't get it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.449 
old tie because if you don't get it
quite<00:01:53.810> right<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.289> doesn't<00:01:54.439> tension<00:01:55.039> properly

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
quite right it doesn't tension properly

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.669 
quite right it doesn't tension properly
the<00:01:56.060> outer<00:01:56.270> tenders<00:01:56.810> intention<00:01:57.229> property<00:01:57.530> so

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the outer tenders intention property so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.289 
the outer tenders intention property so
I've<00:01:57.860> got<00:01:58.130> mine<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:59.420> about<00:02:00.310> centimeter<00:02:01.310> at<00:02:02.149> the

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
I've got mine is about centimeter at the

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.960 
I've got mine is about centimeter at the
end<00:02:02.450> there<00:02:03.099> it's<00:02:04.099> nearly<00:02:04.340> pulled<00:02:04.640> all<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.939> way

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
end there it's nearly pulled all the way

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.569 
end there it's nearly pulled all the way
through<00:02:05.329> it's<00:02:05.569> about<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.750> centimeter<00:02:06.409> free<00:02:06.770> at

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
through it's about a centimeter free at

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.210 
through it's about a centimeter free at
the<00:02:07.610> end<00:02:07.909> there<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.440> when<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.470> did<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.739> is

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
the end there and when I did that is

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.830 
the end there and when I did that is
sort<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.180> tension<00:02:11.660> nicely<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:14.180> save<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.690> this

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
sort of tension nicely and save on this

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.150 
sort of tension nicely and save on this
side<00:02:15.079> as<00:02:15.290> well<00:02:15.489> although<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.700> does<00:02:16.940> seem<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:18.160> be

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
side as well although it does seem to be

should<00:02:28.910> be<00:02:29.230> well<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:31.130> maybe<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.609> pull<00:02:31.880> that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
should be well it's maybe if I pull that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.460 
should be well it's maybe if I pull that
tight<00:02:32.239> he'll<00:02:32.630> pull<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.930> tent<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.260> little

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
tight he'll pull the tent a little

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.949 
tight he'll pull the tent a little
higher<00:02:33.730> hmm<00:02:36.819> okay<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:37.910> inside<00:02:38.450> there's<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> fair
