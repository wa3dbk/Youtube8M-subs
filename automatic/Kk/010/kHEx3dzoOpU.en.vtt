myself I've got little ones here this

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.790 
myself I've got little ones here this
has<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.610> micro<00:00:14.969> USB<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.870> charges<00:00:16.109> off<00:00:16.470> USB

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
has a micro USB and it charges off USB

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.420 
has a micro USB and it charges off USB
and<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:18.000> only<00:00:18.180> about<00:00:21.769> don't<00:00:22.769> even<00:00:22.859> say<00:00:23.220> it's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
and it's only about don't even say it's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
and it's only about don't even say it's
about<00:00:23.550> 2,000<00:00:24.300> milliamps<00:00:24.720> or<00:00:24.810> fifteen<00:00:25.140> hundred

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
about 2,000 milliamps or fifteen hundred

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
about 2,000 milliamps or fifteen hundred
milliamps<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.000> other<00:00:27.180> one

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
milliamps I think got this other one

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.019 
milliamps I think got this other one
this<00:00:27.930> one's<00:00:28.199> 7000<00:00:29.070> milliamps<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.789> bad

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this one's 7000 milliamps it's not bad

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
this one's 7000 milliamps it's not bad
it's<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.420> two<00:00:30.630> USBs<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.250> more

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's got two USBs but this was more

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's got two USBs but this was more
expensive<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.829> i<00:00:34.860> want

this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.710> able<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> charge<00:00:41.190> lots

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this is going to be able to charge lots

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.209 
this is going to be able to charge lots
of<00:00:41.670> devices<00:00:42.059> alive<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:43.379> four<00:00:43.710> ports

take a look at this if you ever are on

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.490 
take a look at this if you ever are on
the<00:00:52.410> road<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.890> need<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> charge<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the road and you need a charge this is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
the road and you need a charge this is
nice<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:56.070> whether<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.940> car

or not it comes with its own plugs and
different<00:01:01.079> adapters<00:01:01.559> apple<00:01:02.250> adapters<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
different adapters apple adapters a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
different adapters apple adapters a
micro<00:01:04.170> USB<00:01:04.199> mini<00:01:04.830> USB<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.600> get

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
micro USB mini USB and so on so you get

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
micro USB mini USB and so on so you get
some<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.229> those<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.189> own

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
some of those I have some of my own

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.539 
some of those I have some of my own
wires<00:01:09.710> comes<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.159> carrying<00:01:11.490> case

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
wires comes with a little carrying case

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.800 
wires comes with a little carrying case
I<00:01:11.939> guess<00:01:13.010> looks<00:01:14.010> barely<00:01:14.400> big<00:01:14.790> enough<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I guess looks barely big enough for the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.070 
I guess looks barely big enough for the
device<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:17.509> don't<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.659> that'll<00:01:18.780> close

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
device I don't know if that'll close

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.230 
device I don't know if that'll close
inside<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:19.979> well<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
inside there very well then we have the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.410 
inside there very well then we have the
device<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.650> instruction<00:01:23.189> manuals<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
device and I instruction manuals so the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
device and I instruction manuals so the
device<00:01:24.659> itself<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.799> too<00:01:26.189> big<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
device itself here is not too big this

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.960 
device itself here is not too big this
is<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> 7000<00:01:27.840> milliamp<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> 12,000

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
is a 7000 milliamp and this is a 12,000

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.450 
is a 7000 milliamp and this is a 12,000
the<00:01:30.540> 7000<00:01:31.290> itself<00:01:31.619> doesn't<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.100> fit<00:01:32.369> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the 7000 itself doesn't really fit in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
the 7000 itself doesn't really fit in
the<00:01:32.520> packet<00:01:32.939> unless<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> cargo

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the packet unless you have like a cargo

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
the packet unless you have like a cargo
pocket<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.040> mean<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> make

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
pocket so i mean it's not going to make

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
pocket so i mean it's not going to make
much<00:01:35.909> difference<00:01:36.470> they<00:01:37.470> they<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.520> them

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
much difference they they all of them

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
much difference they they all of them
all<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.420> backup<00:01:39.780> batteries<00:01:40.079> i<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.320> including

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
all my backup batteries i have including

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.999 
all my backup batteries i have including
this<00:01:40.979> new<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.369> charged<00:01:42.240> simply<00:01:42.720> off<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.320> mini

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this new one charged simply off a mini

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.899 
this new one charged simply off a mini
or<00:01:44.340> micro<00:01:44.930> USB<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.890> real<00:01:47.130> simple<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> charge

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
or micro USB so real simple to charge

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
or micro USB so real simple to charge
and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> nice<00:01:49.350> part<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:50.399> have

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and then here is the nice part we have

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.929 
and then here is the nice part we have
for<00:01:51.119> us<00:01:51.869> bees<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.530> could<00:01:52.680> charge<00:01:52.979> for

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for us bees we could charge for

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
for us bees we could charge for
different<00:01:54.329> things<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.689> once<00:01:54.899> which<00:01:55.170> makes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
different things at once which makes

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.830 
different things at once which makes
this<00:01:55.619> pretty<00:01:55.950> awesome<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.299> says<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.630> here

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
didn't turn on so there must be an

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.280 
didn't turn on so there must be an
on/off<00:03:03.540> switch<00:03:03.900> somewhere<00:03:04.489> here<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:06.290> it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
on/off switch somewhere here it is it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.559 
on/off switch somewhere here it is it

actually I think my GoPro might be fully
charged<00:03:22.519> but<00:03:23.519> I'll<00:03:24.620> turn<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.739> on<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:26.069> we<00:03:26.159> can

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.559 
charged but I'll turn it on so we can
see<00:03:26.459> if<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:26.639> charging<00:03:27.090> it'll<00:03:27.359> show<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
see if it's charging it'll show the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
chart yet it is charging so let's go

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.300 
chart yet it is charging so let's go
ahead<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.319> switch<00:03:34.650> these<00:03:34.859> out<00:03:35.069> real
