on this reptile leash I bought add a few
extra<00:00:08.580> bucks<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.940> my<00:00:09.030> pocket<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.750> decided<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
extra bucks in my pocket so I decided to

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.709 
extra bucks in my pocket so I decided to
get<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.889> look<00:00:11.010> pretty<00:00:11.370> neat<00:00:11.610> as<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.570> can

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
get one it look pretty neat as you can

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.519 
get one it look pretty neat as you can
see<00:00:12.929> after<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:14.160> two<00:00:14.580> hours<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.540> trying<00:00:16.320> to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
see after like two hours of trying to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.670 
see after like two hours of trying to
put<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.220> did<00:00:17.550> manage<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.560> only

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
put it on I did manage to do it the only

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.710 
put it on I did manage to do it the only
downside<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
downside to it really I can see is that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.509 
downside to it really I can see is that
it's<00:00:21.900> hard<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> put<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.410> other<00:00:22.769> than<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.279> it's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
it's hard to put on other than that it's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.089 
it's hard to put on other than that it's
pretty<00:00:24.480> good<00:00:24.660> quality<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
pretty good quality is not that

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.550 
pretty good quality is not that
expensive<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.900> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.050> obviously<00:00:31.439> just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
expensive and you can obviously just

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.139 
expensive and you can obviously just
clip<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.130> anything<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.820> gecko

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
clip it to anything and then your gecko

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.440 
clip it to anything and then your gecko
can<00:00:33.300> roam<00:00:33.480> around<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.989> won't<00:00:34.170> really

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
can roam around and you won't really

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
can roam around and you won't really
have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> chance<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.930> him<00:00:37.050> getting<00:00:37.079> lost<00:00:37.500> which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
have a chance of him getting lost which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090 
have a chance of him getting lost which
would<00:00:38.129> kind<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.399> suck<00:00:39.649> there<00:00:40.649> he<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.829> walking

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
would kind of suck there he is walking

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.990 
would kind of suck there he is walking
around<00:00:41.430> freely<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:43.190> going<00:00:44.190> somewhere

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
around freely on with it going somewhere

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840 
around freely on with it going somewhere
so<00:00:45.960> overall<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.190> actually<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> pretty<00:00:47.700> good

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so overall it's actually a pretty good

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
so overall it's actually a pretty good
product<00:00:48.090> um<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> gecko<00:00:49.860> really

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
product um I don't see the gecko really

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
product um I don't see the gecko really
irritated<00:00:50.910> by<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.539> unless<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
irritated by it that much unless you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.869 
irritated by it that much unless you
actually<00:00:52.800> pull<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> gecko

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
actually pull on it then the gecko

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.010 

and<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.220> fits<00:01:12.400> them<00:01:12.549> pretty<00:01:12.760> good<00:01:12.970> um<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.600> have

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
tried it before sometimes it would slide

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.570 
tried it before sometimes it would slide
off<00:01:16.930> because<00:01:17.320> geckos<00:01:17.770> are<00:01:17.799> quite<00:01:18.220> small<00:01:18.549> I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580

anywhere<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.470> want<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.980> once<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.850> put<00:02:25.000> this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120

anywhere you want so once you put this
over<00:02:25.299> your<00:02:25.510> geckos<00:02:25.840> head<00:02:26.049> try<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.380> slide<00:02:26.769> his

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
over your geckos head try to slide his

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.569 
over your geckos head try to slide his
arms<00:02:27.489> through<00:02:28.180> here<00:02:28.540> then<00:02:29.220> move<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.549> I

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
arms through here then move this so I

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.789 
arms through here then move this so I
could<00:02:30.670> tighten<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.329> then<00:02:31.480> push<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.620> button

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
could tighten and then push this button

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.100 
could tighten and then push this button
and<00:02:33.010> slide<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> would<00:02:34.150> lock

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and slide it so that it would lock

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.699 
and slide it so that it would lock
obviously<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.010> then<00:02:37.019> it'll<00:02:38.019> basically<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.560> on

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
obviously and then it'll basically be on

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.740 
obviously and then it'll basically be on
your<00:02:38.890> gecko<00:02:39.250> bearded<00:02:39.850> dragon<00:02:40.180> whatever<00:02:40.480> and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
your gecko bearded dragon whatever and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.509 
your gecko bearded dragon whatever and
it'll<00:02:41.350> normally<00:02:41.920> stay<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.310> there<00:02:42.459> pretty<00:02:42.700> good

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
it'll normally stay on there pretty good

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.220 
it'll normally stay on there pretty good
obviously<00:02:45.519> if<00:02:45.730> your<00:02:45.940> animals<00:02:46.570> too<00:02:46.750> small<00:02:47.019> it's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
obviously if your animals too small it's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.960 
obviously if your animals too small it's
going<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> slide<00:02:47.650> right<00:02:47.709> out<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.790> too

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
going to slide right out but it's too

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.259 
going to slide right out but it's too
big<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:50.109> easily<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:51.060> expand<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> and

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
big you can easily just expand it and

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.599 
big you can easily just expand it and
they'll<00:02:52.390> be<00:02:52.420> fine<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:54.340> works<00:02:54.519> pretty<00:02:54.700> good

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
they'll be fine so it works pretty good

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.890 
they'll be fine so it works pretty good
over<00:02:57.609> here<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.269> see<00:02:58.450> there's<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.720> little

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
over here you can see there's a little

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.370 
over here you can see there's a little
clip<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.209> can<00:03:01.420> clip<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.989> anything

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
clip so you can clip this to anything

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.979 
clip so you can clip this to anything
really<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.910> they<00:03:04.090> really<00:03:04.329> do<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.540> clip<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
really all they really do is clip it to

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.099 
really all they really do is clip it to
like<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.260> water<00:03:05.560> bottle<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.030> boom<00:03:07.269> you
