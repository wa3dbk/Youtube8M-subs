a look at the car let's have a look at

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.680 
a look at the car let's have a look at
the<00:00:31.439> edge<00:00:31.590> first<00:00:32.090> okay<00:00:33.320> there<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.440> wings

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
the edge first okay there are two wings

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.950 
the edge first okay there are two wings
here<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.680> okay<00:00:38.489> put<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.059> wings<00:00:39.480> here

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
here right here okay put your wings here

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.290 
here right here okay put your wings here
yeah<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.520> prevent<00:00:41.910> pop<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
yeah it can prevent pop it this is the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
yeah it can prevent pop it this is the
corner<00:00:45.719> again<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> put<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.829> together<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
corner again we put them together you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.959 
corner again we put them together you
can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.629> wing<00:00:51.899> will<00:00:52.170> fit<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.370> orbit

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
can see the wing will fit in the orbit

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.080 
can see the wing will fit in the orbit
of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.420> corner<00:00:54.780> piece<00:00:55.070> soldiers<00:00:56.090> obvious

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
of the corner piece soldiers obvious

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.650 
of the corner piece soldiers obvious
like<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.320> no<00:00:58.620> chance<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.129> will<00:00:59.250> pop

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
like there's no chance they will pop

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.730 
like there's no chance they will pop
okay<00:01:02.270> um<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.040> corner<00:01:05.460> piece<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
okay um then this is corner piece it is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.840 
okay um then this is corner piece it is
something<00:01:08.000> somewhat<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.540> V<00:01:10.080> cubes<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
something somewhat like a V cubes that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.859 
something somewhat like a V cubes that
the<00:01:11.850> corner<00:01:12.299> counts<00:01:12.840> pop<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.869> with

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the corner counts pop out and see with

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.429 
the corner counts pop out and see with
to<00:01:16.049> dislike<00:01:16.560> well<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.439> can't

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to dislike well do it like this I can't

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.160 
to dislike well do it like this I can't
call<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:21.030> can't<00:01:21.330> pop

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.109 

and<00:01:25.170> someone<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.520> asked<00:01:27.149> what<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
and someone had asked what what is this

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.550 
and someone had asked what what is this
strange<00:01:30.119> shape<00:01:30.600> doing<00:01:31.220> okay<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:34.409> ok

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
strange shape doing okay that's right ok

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
strange shape doing okay that's right ok
this<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:36.030> feel<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.780> turned<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
this you feel and turned this is the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.039 
this you feel and turned this is the
corner<00:01:40.320> piece<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> center<00:01:42.090> p<00:01:42.299> if

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
corner piece and this is the center p if

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.529 
corner piece and this is the center p if
we<00:01:43.289> turn<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.920> corner<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.030> 45

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
we turn the corner like this on to 45

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.560 
we turn the corner like this on to 45
degrees<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:53.130> change<00:01:53.520> shape<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.390> we

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
degrees the this change shape here we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.039 
degrees the this change shape here we
have<00:01:54.689> followed<00:01:55.259> orbit<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.450> what<00:01:57.450> goes<00:01:57.720> if

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
have followed orbit and what goes if

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
have followed orbit and what goes if
it's<00:01:58.380> Vera<00:01:58.649> where<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> centerpiece<00:02:00.619> ok

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it's Vera where was the centerpiece ok

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's Vera where was the centerpiece ok
so<00:02:04.100> yeah<00:02:06.080> okay<00:02:07.369> finally<00:02:08.369> let's<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> look

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so yeah okay finally let's have a look

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:24.520 
so yeah okay finally let's have a look
at<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.610> that's<00:02:11.610> good<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.360> think<00:02:12.690> down<00:02:12.930> first

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.650 

it's<00:02:25.530> very<00:02:25.680> difficult<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.519> store<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.450> put

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
it's very difficult in store and to put

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.000 
it's very difficult in store and to put
everything<00:02:27.989> together<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:31.970> ok<00:02:32.970> let's<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
everything together and ok let's have a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.599 
everything together and ok let's have a
look<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.519> corner<00:02:35.940> pie<00:02:36.120> things<00:02:36.329> first<00:02:36.630> and

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
look at the corner pie things first and

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.740 
look at the corner pie things first and
on<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.730> car<00:02:38.910> thing<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.750> 20<00:02:40.260> degrees

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
on the car thing that's like 20 degrees

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.590 
on the car thing that's like 20 degrees
where<00:02:42.750> are<00:02:42.870> they<00:02:44.060> 30<00:02:45.060> degrees

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.980 

it<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.920> go<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:52.200> 40<00:02:53.200> degrees<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.890> most

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
it can go to like 40 degrees of the most

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.830 
it can go to like 40 degrees of the most
yeah<00:02:56.100> someone<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> that's<00:02:58.960> 40<00:02:59.320> degrees<00:02:59.650> maybe

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
yeah someone so that's 40 degrees maybe

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:14.300 
yeah someone so that's 40 degrees maybe
change<00:03:08.220> almost<00:03:09.220> 45<00:03:10.180> degrees

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.970 

hey<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.470> reverse<00:03:16.470> corner<00:03:16.950> cutting<00:03:18.709> I'll<00:03:19.709> 10

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
hey and reverse corner cutting I'll 10

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.940 
hey and reverse corner cutting I'll 10
degrees<00:03:20.340> which<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:22.020> no<00:03:22.230> difficulty<00:03:22.830> at

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
degrees which was just no difficulty at

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.490 
degrees which was just no difficulty at
all<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.489> maybe<00:03:27.120> dirty<00:03:27.959> degree

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
all like it can go to maybe dirty degree

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:44.740 
all like it can go to maybe dirty degree
something<00:03:29.390> no

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.810
