this<00:00:08.610> video<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.300> after<00:00:09.719> playing<00:00:10.019> around<00:00:10.230> with

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
this video and after playing around with

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
this video and after playing around with
it<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> PBE<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.099> think<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> item<00:00:11.910> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
it on the PBE I think that the item is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.020 
it on the PBE I think that the item is
actually<00:00:12.509> insanely<00:00:13.259> powerful<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.700> likely

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
actually insanely powerful and is likely

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.609 
actually insanely powerful and is likely
going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.330> impact<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> meta<00:00:15.960> quite<00:00:16.320> heavily

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619

skills myself micro ring stacks was a
little<00:03:30.959> bit<00:03:31.049> hard<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.320> keep<00:03:31.500> track<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.860> amongst

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
little bit hard to keep track of amongst

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
that it can be hard to use it's quite

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.170 
that it can be hard to use it's quite
similar<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.380> an<00:03:37.620> arse<00:03:37.920> ultimate<00:03:38.640> actually<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
similar to an arse ultimate actually and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.580 
similar to an arse ultimate actually and
that<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.390> don't<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:39.930> decide<00:03:40.380> when<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
that you don't really decide when to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.319 
that you don't really decide when to
proc<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.610> influence<00:03:42.030> it

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
proc it on but you can influence it

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.660 
proc it on but you can influence it
quite<00:03:42.660> heavily<00:03:42.959> but<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:44.010> quite<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> few

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
quite heavily but on quite a few

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.020 
quite heavily but on quite a few
champions<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.570> not<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.230> difficult<00:03:46.500> at<00:03:46.890> all

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
champions it's not that difficult at all

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.100 
champions it's not that difficult at all
especially<00:03:48.030> when<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.209> consider<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.720> kits<00:03:48.930> of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
especially when you consider the kits of

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.620 
especially when you consider the kits of
a<00:03:49.170> champion<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.739> Sona<00:03:50.220> maybe<00:03:50.880> Jana<00:03:51.360> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
a champion like Sona maybe Jana and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.600 
a champion like Sona maybe Jana and
other<00:03:51.870> utility<00:03:52.350> supports<00:03:52.829> usually<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.459> can

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
other utility supports usually you can

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.490 
other utility supports usually you can
just<00:03:53.790> use<00:03:54.239> all<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.630> your<00:03:54.690> abilities<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.230> get

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
just use all of your abilities and get

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.460 
just use all of your abilities and get
40<00:03:55.920> stacks<00:03:56.250> pretty<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.120> instantly<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.900> so

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
40 stacks pretty much instantly and so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.289 
40 stacks pretty much instantly and so
it's<00:03:58.620> not<00:03:58.799> actually<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.400> hard<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.940> proc<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
it's not actually that hard to proc it

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.569 
it's not actually that hard to proc it
on<00:04:00.420> time<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.590> have<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.980> make<00:04:02.100> sure<00:04:02.160> that

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
on time you just have to make sure that

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.240 
on time you just have to make sure that
you<00:04:02.700> aren't<00:04:02.970> proc<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.750> too<00:04:04.019> early<00:04:04.650> which<00:04:05.130> is

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
you aren't proc it too early which is

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.800 
you aren't proc it too early which is
something<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.640> found<00:04:05.940> happened<00:04:06.390> quite<00:04:06.780> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
something that I found happened quite a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.690 
something that I found happened quite a
bit<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:08.010> certainly<00:04:08.190> something<00:04:08.370> that

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
bit and it's certainly something that

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.789 
bit and it's certainly something that
your<00:04:08.970> team<00:04:09.329> will<00:04:09.780> probably<00:04:10.350> not<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:10.769> a

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
your team will probably not have a

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.349 
your team will probably not have a
problem<00:04:11.070> playing<00:04:11.340> around<00:04:11.549> actually<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.180> you

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
problem playing around actually if you

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.449 
problem playing around actually if you
have<00:04:12.480> proper<00:04:12.870> communication<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.190> would

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
have proper communication so I would

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.250 
have proper communication so I would
definitely<00:04:14.700> expect<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.299> item<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.660> stomp<00:04:16.079> in

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
definitely expect this item to stomp in

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.349 
definitely expect this item to stomp in
competitive<00:04:16.739> play<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.250> potentially<00:04:18.120> create

competitive play and potentially create

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.539 
competitive play and potentially create

a strong enough item for teams to make

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.990 
a strong enough item for teams to make
use<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.290> in<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> way<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.640> meadow<00:04:38.820> with

use of in that way and in a meadow with
assassins<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:39.780> been<00:04:39.930> nerfed<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.230> the

think<00:04:42.630> we<00:04:42.720> are<00:04:42.840> poised<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.050> see<00:04:43.410> some<00:04:43.650> strong

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
think we are poised to see some strong

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.340 
think we are poised to see some strong
ad<00:04:44.220> carries<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:44.820> bruisers<00:04:45.390> make<00:04:45.900> use<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.140> this

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
ad carries and bruisers make use of this

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.030 
ad carries and bruisers make use of this
item<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.800> really<00:04:47.100> dominate<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.670> meta<00:04:48.890> so<00:04:49.890> what

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
item to really dominate the meta so what

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.650 
item to really dominate the meta so what
do<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.160> think<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.700> item<00:04:50.910> overpowered<00:04:51.390> it

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
do you think is the item overpowered it

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.170 
do you think is the item overpowered it
probably<00:04:52.530> isn't<00:04:52.740> for<00:04:53.130> solo<00:04:53.340> q<00:04:53.580> actually<00:04:53.940> since

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
probably isn't for solo q actually since

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.030 
probably isn't for solo q actually since
it<00:04:54.300> does<00:04:54.510> require<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:55.050> solid<00:04:55.650> amount<00:04:55.860> of

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
it does require a solid amount of

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.400 
it does require a solid amount of
coordination<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.820> skill<00:04:57.420> and<00:04:57.630> timing<00:04:58.260> to

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
coordination and skill and timing to

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.350 
coordination and skill and timing to
make<00:04:58.530> use<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.770> but<00:04:59.460> in<00:04:59.550> duo<00:04:59.820> queue<00:05:00.120> and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360
