00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.650
 four videos the first is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.689

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.310
 for to do the tasks of all 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.360
 days I had made you an article a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.380
 not long on the site 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 so I have no time but it's 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.640
 about six months a year I am very 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 conscious very well aware that is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.990
 normal person watch videos part 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.460
 watch video go watch videos 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.829
 and do not go to the site even though either 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.750
 also tiare a lot of things that do not 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 are not in video but we are free to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.990
 you to do what you want so I 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.610
 I said to myself, I'm doing this on video 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.060
 always more fun and it's interactive 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.950
 what 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.470
 today we will tackle the cavs 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.870
 keyboard shortcuts such as the most 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.010
 simple copy cut copy paste 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.470
 go back put bold in 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.880
 Italy when highlight leaving a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.340
 application open the ferrand pairs this 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.849
 system you see the updates from 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 software 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.800
 open forces there guide adds a 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.030
 English will open a window full of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 things like that that does if your life that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.269
 save again I'll tell them a 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.739
 time not possible this movie we talked 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.390
 will now tackle the subject 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.330
 main video how to 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.260
 to use keyboard shortcuts / 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.549
 now here I have written some 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.709
 thing he does not mean anything about their 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.030
 on the mac to do kind you see 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.069
 that I wrote something so we go 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.680
 start with a keyboard shortcut while 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.580
 beast is called the copy paste 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.830
 usually when we do a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.790
 copy and paste you underline everything you 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.700
 done right click 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.209
 copy you go to the line you do 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.489
 Right click 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.220
 snare there we'll do something 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.180
 more interesting so we'll copied and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.880
 have these hazards checked the line and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.910
 have v control and then you stick 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.989
 all this is super simply other 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.310
 thing you say ah no actually I 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.200
 wanted in caux.les that 1 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 you have z control and you remove 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.100
 whatever you want and he you 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.609
 will remain more than a noah is super 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760
 simply 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.540
 and then after you want to take 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.489
 something and the coupe how x good 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.590
 that's the same function as 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.030
 in beings that there is to cut a 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.170
 character and that's frankly great 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750
 well and it saves time 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.819
 impossible for url in safari 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.889
 copy and paste paf pouf pouf pouf enough 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.480
 sweet single copy paste text that 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.220
 is frankly own copy 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.329
 paste it's good the text I know but 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.500
 this is me it's one of 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.139
 features that I use 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.420
 I think most copy it stick with 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.400
 the keyboard other functionality that binds 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.380
 with recruits and shortcuts 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.440
 forgiveness keyboard is for example when 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.569
 you want to put everything in bold bold that 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.120
 means bold in English and like you 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.250
 wrote it in the menu bar the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.079
 grath gerber you order is 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.730
 simply you click on b and 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.650
 you have everything you put in a bowl 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.450
 italic click you if you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.849
 would you leave click on any 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.560
 simply wanted to remove the b the y and the 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.389
 purpose it's super simple 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.190
 you put back the weather ivory can 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.960
 you do what you want and then 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.610
 control z and you remove everything that 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.520
 you want and then after you want 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.290
 cut the text how x and that's it 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.180
 is super simple in life 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.010
 sometimes you need to do some 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.510
 screenshots you have several 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.139
 modes like on the pc do catches 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.840
 super stupid screen using the 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.820
 settings and here the same you take 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.610
 how do you take the shift key that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.870
 is the key m in upper case but 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.090
 only when you strip on it 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.550
 and you take 3 and there you take a 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.770
 screenshot that takes you look 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.450
 the whole screen so your computer and 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.220
 you have a hood that screenshots 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.600
 she asks you to choose what you 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.700
 want to take you do the same 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.680
 numeral controls is the real peace on 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.090
 four there you have a small point 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.540
 coming hours you see it's in 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.660
 train to move 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.070
 and if now you want to take that 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.240
 that me you choose what you 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.540
 want to simply take 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.490
 and there you let go and the little picture that 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.889
 you're going to parraitre just down we click 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.860
 on it and that's the screenshot at 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.180
 sale after before after and it's something 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.669
 this too, which I'm using 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.530
 a lot of other small catches 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.510
 screen is that it is one that 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.840
 allows you to take only the 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:42.160
 window is open with an effect of 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.260
 depth controls shift 4 and the bar 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.030
 the space and there is a small logo 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.470
 of cameras that has arrived and you 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.960
 chosen be you can take the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.380
 office or be you take the window 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.729
 opened 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.880
 there we will take the open window on 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.370
 click on it we go on the desk 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.020
 and there you have your window 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.479
 that was taken only the 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.030
 window with the background that is him 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.400
 saw as a super dark effect 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.500
 nice that available in pages where here 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.070
 now on safari so we're on 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.289
 the site that collects and gilly has 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.280
 a lot of keyboard shortcuts I 'm doing 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.169
 not everything I wanted to do because we 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.610

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.370
