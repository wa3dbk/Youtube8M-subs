they must have had a reason for doing
that<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:05.549> sure<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.060> R&amp;D<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
that I'm sure there was some R&amp;D that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
that I'm sure there was some R&amp;D that
went<00:02:06.960> into<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.160> no<00:02:08.369> first-hand

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
went into it but I have no first-hand

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.240 
went into it but I have no first-hand
knowledge<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.929> effects<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.069> have

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
knowledge of the effects that would have

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.100 
knowledge of the effects that would have
but<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.790> radically<00:02:12.209> different

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
but that was radically different

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.660 
but that was radically different
from<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> same<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
from there up it's the same you have the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.000 
from there up it's the same you have the
same<00:02:14.910> shim<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> whale<00:02:16.470> fin<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
same shim you have the whale fin that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.430 
same shim you have the whale fin that
puts<00:02:17.220> tension<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.570> saddles<00:02:21.200> you've<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
puts tension on the saddles you've got a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.660 
puts tension on the saddles you've got a
three<00:02:23.870> bolt<00:02:24.870> mounting<00:02:25.320> system<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.310> connect

three bolt mounting system to connect
the<00:02:26.790> block<00:02:27.030> these<00:02:27.360> are<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.600> machine<00:02:27.960> bolts

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
the block these are like machine bolts

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.310 
the block these are like machine bolts
and<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> lot<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.360> same<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.990> love

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320

the money to have it dipped and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.600 
the money to have it dipped and
rechromed<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.250> looks<00:02:50.400> pretty

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
rechromed but you know it looks pretty

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.350

the<00:03:41.549> only<00:03:41.910> one<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.049> know<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.320> that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
the only one that I know of that

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
manufactures these special strings with

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.900 
manufactures these special strings with
these<00:03:45.690> brass<00:03:45.959> bolts<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> end<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:47.130> both

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
these brass bolts on the end on both

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.199 
these brass bolts on the end on both
ends<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.860> that's<00:03:50.130> gonna<00:03:50.340> really<00:03:50.670> limit

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
ends and so that's gonna really limit

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.780 
ends and so that's gonna really limit
the<00:03:51.420> use<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.410> tremolo<00:03:52.680> but<00:03:53.130> we'll<00:03:53.519> see<00:03:53.700> if

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the use of the tremolo but we'll see if

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.180 
the use of the tremolo but we'll see if
they<00:03:53.880> get<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.120> work<00:03:54.269> out<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.830> ordered<00:03:56.100> a
