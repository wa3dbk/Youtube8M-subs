for the print and cut and most

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.380 
for the print and cut and most
reasonably<00:02:15.500> priced<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.130> also<00:02:16.700> picked<00:02:16.940> up<00:02:17.120> some

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
reasonably priced I also picked up some

trouble child she sees who also half off

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.460 
trouble child she sees who also half off
so<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.210> don't<00:02:20.720> know<00:02:20.840> what<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.020> makes<00:02:21.230> these

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
so I don't know what that makes these

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.990 
so I don't know what that makes these
like<00:02:21.590> maybe<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.890> quarter<00:02:22.190> apiece<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.730> don't<00:02:22.910> know

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
like maybe a quarter apiece I don't know

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.660 
like maybe a quarter apiece I don't know
um<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.110> picked<00:02:24.350> up<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.800> for<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.160> friend<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.610> mine

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
um I picked up this for a friend of mine

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.280 
um I picked up this for a friend of mine
whose<00:02:26.060> little<00:02:26.210> boy<00:02:26.390> does<00:02:26.570> sock<00:02:26.900> monkeys

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
whose little boy does sock monkeys

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.750 
whose little boy does sock monkeys
everything<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.800> sock<00:02:27.980> monkeys<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:28.700> she

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
everything is sock monkeys so she

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.290 
everything is sock monkeys so she
doesn't<00:02:29.120> scrapbook<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.440> um<00:02:30.620> she's<00:02:31.100> baby<00:02:32.000> now

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
and he's he's over one and so he I think

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.330 
and he's he's over one and so he I think
she<00:02:37.820> has<00:02:37.940> time<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.240> step<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:38.690> now<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:40.040> I'm<00:02:40.190> gonna

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
she has time to step up now so I'm gonna
