lumber<00:00:51.180> metal<00:00:51.809> stone<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.670> completed<00:00:54.210> all

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
lumber metal stone and I completed all

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.069 
lumber metal stone and I completed all
my<00:00:54.390> research<00:00:56.510> as<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.020> here<00:01:00.079> up

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
my research as you can see right here up

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.070 
my research as you can see right here up
rationing<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:03.229> rationing<00:01:04.229> level<00:01:04.500> 20<00:01:04.970> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
rationing and rationing level 20 and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.750 
rationing and rationing level 20 and
when<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:10.439> only<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> minus<00:01:11.310> 1

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
when you do that you only have a minus 1

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.140 
when you do that you only have a minus 1
consumption<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.560> any<00:01:14.520> food<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
consumption because so any food that you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.590 
consumption because so any food that you
gather<00:01:15.890> will<00:01:17.060> essentially<00:01:18.060> stay<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.450> your

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
gather will essentially stay in your

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.679 
gather will essentially stay in your
city<00:01:18.810> until<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.390> good

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
city until use it so that's that's good

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
city until use it so that's that's good
that<00:01:21.900> helps<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> lot<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:23.580> build<00:01:24.180> some

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that helps out a lot can build some

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.249 
that helps out a lot can build some

much lately oops go back here there we
go<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.489> I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.360 

so<00:03:04.450> when<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:04.930> becomes<00:03:05.439> available<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.159> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
so when this becomes available in the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.020 
so when this becomes available in the
wild<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.299> probably<00:03:07.720> i<00:03:08.500> should<00:03:09.159> say<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:09.579> know<00:03:09.849> I'll

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
wild I probably i should say I know I'll

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.589 
wild I probably i should say I know I'll
get<00:03:10.659> it<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.680> right<00:03:12.220> now<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.939> only<00:03:13.000> way<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.360> get

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
get it but right now the only way to get

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.149 
get it but right now the only way to get
it<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.230> purchase<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.640> shop<00:03:15.849> so

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
it is to purchase it's in the shop so

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.490 
it is to purchase it's in the shop so
I'm<00:03:18.159> just<00:03:18.280> waiting<00:03:18.549> on<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:19.170> everything<00:03:20.170> else

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
I'm just waiting on that everything else

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.280 
I'm just waiting on that everything else
is<00:03:20.890> pretty<00:03:21.430> good<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.640> 40<00:03:25.030> 1.4<00:03:26.280> million<00:03:27.280> power

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
is pretty good so 40 1.4 million power

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.530 
is pretty good so 40 1.4 million power
ranking<00:03:29.290> up<00:03:29.409> a<00:03:29.530> little<00:03:29.769> bit<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.329> should

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
ranking up a little bit I think I should

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.160 
ranking up a little bit I think I should
level<00:03:32.079> up<00:03:32.349> to<00:03:32.530> 23<00:03:33.390> pretty<00:03:34.390> soon<00:03:34.629> i<00:03:34.840> would<00:03:34.959> say

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
level up to 23 pretty soon i would say

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.349 
level up to 23 pretty soon i would say
in<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.470> next<00:03:35.700> probably<00:03:36.700> day<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> half<00:03:37.180> or

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
in the next probably day and a half or

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.699 
in the next probably day and a half or
so<00:03:37.500> i'm<00:03:38.500> hoping<00:03:38.790> not<00:03:39.790> sure<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.290> got<00:03:41.590> my

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
so i'm hoping not sure but I got my

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.860 
so i'm hoping not sure but I got my
swimmers<00:03:42.159> going<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:43.150> right<00:03:43.450> now<00:03:43.629> I'm<00:03:43.690> doing
