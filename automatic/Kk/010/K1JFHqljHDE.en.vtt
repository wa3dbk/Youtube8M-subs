00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
pinkie this looks like a a minor shape

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490 
pinkie this looks like a a minor shape
up<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.530> whole-step<00:02:02.030> bar<00:02:03.030> down<00:02:03.330> becomes<00:02:03.960> B<00:02:04.200> minor

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
up a whole-step bar down becomes B minor

a<00:02:04.800> minor<00:02:05.490> B<00:02:06.390> minor<00:02:06.800> so<00:02:07.800> we've<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.070> G<00:02:09.979> not<00:02:10.979> B

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
a minor B minor so we've got G not B

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.390 
a minor B minor so we've got G not B
minor<00:02:11.400> bar<00:02:11.670> chord

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.510 

then<00:02:15.000> you've<00:02:15.209> got<00:02:15.530> sea

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.620 

to<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:22.080> again<00:02:22.550> 2d<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.240> were<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.480> just

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
to do see again 2d so if I were to just

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.450 
to do see again 2d so if I were to just
count<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.560> two<00:02:26.310> three<00:02:27.270> four<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.950> two

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
count be one two three four one two

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.559 
count be one two three four one two
three<00:02:30.330> four<00:02:31.640> one<00:02:32.640> two<00:02:33.380> three

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
three four one two three

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.650 
three four one two three
four<00:02:35.200> one<00:02:36.189> two<00:02:37.120> three<00:02:38.430> four

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
four one two three four

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.260 
four one two three four
on<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.680> D<00:02:40.860> chord<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:42.960> that's<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.380> diverse

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
on that D chord so that's the diverse

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.340 
on that D chord so that's the diverse
then<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.620> pre-chorus<00:02:47.160> which<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.350> C

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
then we have the pre-chorus which is C

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.030 
then we have the pre-chorus which is C
for<00:02:49.590> 2<00:02:49.770> D<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.430> two

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.199 

you<00:02:56.040> could<00:02:56.219> pick<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.879> two<00:02:57.780> three<00:02:58.609> four

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
you could pick it one two three four

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:09.820 
you could pick it one two three four
I'm<00:03:00.659> strumming<00:03:01.379> it<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.680> know

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.350 

if<00:03:10.280> you've<00:03:10.550> got<00:03:10.730> c4<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.450> d4<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.700> g4<00:03:13.700> 4<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.270> you

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
if you've got c4 to d4 to g4 4 so you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.510 
if you've got c4 to d4 to g4 4 so you
got

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.730 

but<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> next<00:03:22.450> time<00:03:22.600> starts<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.560> same

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
but then the next time starts the same

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.270 
but then the next time starts the same
way

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
