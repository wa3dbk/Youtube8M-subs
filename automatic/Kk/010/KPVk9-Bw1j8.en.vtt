00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
today I'm going to be using this beyonce

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.620 
today I'm going to be using this beyonce
one<00:03:19.860> because<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.220> super<00:03:20.670> intense<00:03:21.000> red<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
one because it's super intense red and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.350 
one because it's super intense red and
I'm<00:03:22.500> going<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.920> apply<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.610> my<00:03:23.730> lips<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
I'm going to apply this to my lips and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.750 
I'm going to apply this to my lips and
when<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.320> apply<00:03:25.530> products<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.520> it's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
when you apply products like this it's

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.610 
when you apply products like this it's
best<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.090> only<00:03:27.240> apply<00:03:27.960> it<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.410> direction

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
best to only apply it in one direction

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.610 
best to only apply it in one direction
so<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.520> get<00:03:29.820> an<00:03:30.180> even<00:03:30.510> amount<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:31.080> color<00:03:31.350> on

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
so you get an even amount of color on

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.260 
so you get an even amount of color on
your<00:03:31.770> lips<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.250> an<00:03:32.370> even<00:03:32.700> coat<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.150> it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
your lips you get an even coat and it

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.960 
your lips you get an even coat and it
dries<00:03:33.570> evenly<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:35.550> we're<00:03:35.640> going<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> do<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
dries evenly so we're going to do that

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.500 
dries evenly so we're going to do that
right<00:03:36.150> now

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
right now

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.240 
right now
so<00:03:36.960> when<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.170> apply<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> red<00:03:37.680> color<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:38.070> this

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so when you apply a red color like this

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.610 
so when you apply a red color like this
and<00:03:38.910> you're<00:03:39.570> playing<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.990> someone<00:03:40.260> else<00:03:40.410> it's

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
because it's not like a lip gloss or

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.270 
because it's not like a lip gloss or
anything<00:05:06.660> like<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.650> look<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.070> can't

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
anything like that and look you can't

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.370 
anything like that and look you can't
even<00:05:08.400> see<00:05:08.550> any<00:05:08.700> color<00:05:09.000> on<00:05:09.180> there<00:05:09.390> and<00:05:10.140> as<00:05:10.260> I

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
even see any color on there and as I

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.960 
even see any color on there and as I
like<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.740> feeling<00:05:11.010> sometimes<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.640> have<00:05:11.790> like

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970

the<00:05:12.060> lip<00:05:12.300> gloss<00:05:12.570> that's<00:05:12.960> clear<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.620> that

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
the lip gloss that's clear and that

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.200 
the lip gloss that's clear and that
could<00:05:14.250> still<00:05:14.460> be<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.580> little<00:05:14.850> sticky<00:05:15.060> so

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
could still be a little sticky so

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.580 
could still be a little sticky so
sometimes<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.900> can't<00:05:16.169> kiss<00:05:16.380> your
