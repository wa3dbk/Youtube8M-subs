00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.540 

with<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.660> ping<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.020> 0.5<00:03:54.470> for<00:03:54.800> Verizon<00:03:55.370> has<00:03:55.520> a

with a ping of 0.5 for Verizon has a
horrible<00:03:56.000> paying<00:03:56.330> there<00:03:56.540> at<00:03:56.660> 2:15<00:03:57.200> that's

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
horrible paying there at 2:15 that's

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.830 
horrible paying there at 2:15 that's
really<00:03:57.710> bad<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.760> looks<00:03:59.120> like<00:03:59.180> Verizon<00:03:59.720> is

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
really bad but looks like Verizon is

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.510 
really bad but looks like Verizon is
getting<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.230> better<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.770> download<00:04:01.250> test

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
getting the better of the download test

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.600 
getting the better of the download test
in<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:01.910> example<00:04:02.540> up<00:04:02.840> they<00:04:03.500> look<00:04:03.650> up<00:04:03.920> t-mobile

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
in this example up they look up t-mobile

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.480 
in this example up they look up t-mobile
passed<00:04:04.910> him<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.860> has<00:04:06.860> started<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> pull

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
passed him up and has started to pull

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.890 
passed him up and has started to pull
away<00:04:07.540> Wow

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
away Wow

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.560 
away Wow
so<00:04:09.200> even<00:04:09.380> when<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.620> started<00:04:09.890> bad<00:04:10.510> they<00:04:11.510> still

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
so even when they started bad they still

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.540 
so even when they started bad they still
were<00:04:11.870> able<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.110> come<00:04:12.320> back<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.530> was<00:04:12.710> kind<00:04:13.460> of

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
were able to come back I was kind of

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.420 
were able to come back I was kind of
wondering<00:04:13.910> there<00:04:14.270> what<00:04:14.420> was<00:04:14.510> going<00:04:14.750> on<00:04:15.430> upload

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
wondering there what was going on upload

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.330 
wondering there what was going on upload
speeds<00:04:19.570> up<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.870> we<00:04:21.140> have<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.350> failure<00:04:22.040> on<00:04:22.220> the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
speeds up and we have a failure on the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.670 
speeds up and we have a failure on the
t-mobile<00:04:22.670> side<00:04:23.320> we<00:04:24.320> have<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.470> network

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
t-mobile side we have a network

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.440 
t-mobile side we have a network
communication<00:04:25.400> issue<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.000> we're<00:04:26.210> gonna<00:04:26.300> go

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
communication issue so we're gonna go

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:40.390 
communication issue so we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:26.540> do<00:04:26.720> another<00:04:26.900> test<00:04:32.860> go<00:04:33.860> 3<00:04:34.280> 2<00:04:35.150> 1<00:04:39.400> maybe

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
ahead do another test go 3 2 1 maybe

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.130 
ahead do another test go 3 2 1 maybe
that<00:04:40.580> server<00:04:40.850> in<00:04:41.060> Tampa<00:04:41.450> is<00:04:41.510> bad<00:04:41.690> but<00:04:42.020> we'll

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
that server in Tampa is bad but we'll

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.290 
that server in Tampa is bad but we'll
see<00:04:42.350> looks<00:04:43.280> better<00:04:43.460> on<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.760> t-mobile<00:04:44.000> side

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
see looks better on the t-mobile side

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.260 
see looks better on the t-mobile side
this<00:04:44.480> time<00:04:44.720> as<00:04:44.990> they<00:04:45.980> are<00:04:46.010> still<00:04:46.820> in<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.060> same

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
this time as they are still in the same

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.040 
this time as they are still in the same
area<00:04:47.660> still<00:04:48.410> on<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.620> same<00:04:48.770> server<00:04:49.100> and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
area still on the same server and

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
area still on the same server and
t-mobile<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.230> crushing<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:51.980> one<00:04:54.070> they

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
t-mobile is crushing on this one they

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.320 
t-mobile is crushing on this one they
did<00:04:55.250> great<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.580> last<00:04:55.760> one<00:04:55.970> too<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.240> then

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
did great on the last one too and then

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.610 
did great on the last one too and then
they<00:04:56.419> failed<00:04:56.660> on<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.930> upload<00:04:57.200> we'll<00:04:57.380> see<00:04:57.530> if

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
they failed on the upload we'll see if

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.320 
they failed on the upload we'll see if
it<00:04:57.740> actually<00:04:57.770> completes<00:04:58.580> their<00:04:58.760> upload<00:04:59.090> test

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
it actually completes their upload test

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.730 
it actually completes their upload test
and<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.690> one<00:04:59.870> or<00:05:00.050> if<00:05:00.169> they're<00:05:00.320> gonna<00:05:00.470> have<00:05:00.710> a

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and this one or if they're gonna have a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.550 
and this one or if they're gonna have a
network<00:05:01.040> issue<00:05:01.390> on<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.570> upload<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.020> have<00:05:03.260> seen

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
network issue on the upload I have seen

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.790 
network issue on the upload I have seen
that<00:05:03.740> before<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:05.200> there<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.260> goes<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:06.650> does

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
that before and there it goes it does

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.480 
that before and there it goes it does
fail<00:05:07.070> on<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.520> upload<00:05:08.830> well<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> download

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
fail on the upload well in the download

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.540 
fail on the upload well in the download
test<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:11.030> think<00:05:11.060> it's<00:05:11.390> pretty<00:05:11.860> clear<00:05:12.860> who<00:05:13.340> the

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
test I think it's pretty clear who the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.150 
test I think it's pretty clear who the
winner<00:05:13.580> is<00:05:13.850> here<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.450> do<00:05:15.169> see<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.620> consistent

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
winner is here I do see the consistent

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.500 
winner is here I do see the consistent
failing<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:16.760> let<00:05:16.880> me<00:05:16.940> see<00:05:17.060> if<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.210> could<00:05:17.360> switch

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
failing so let me see if I could switch

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.300 
failing so let me see if I could switch
to<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.780> other<00:05:17.990> server<00:05:18.410> in<00:05:19.190> Tampa<00:05:21.310> because

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
to the other server in Tampa because

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.700 
to the other server in Tampa because
there<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:22.760> two<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.210> we<00:05:23.810> have<00:05:23.930> high<00:05:24.140> velocity

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
there is two and we have high velocity

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.670 
there is two and we have high velocity
hosting<00:05:25.419> so<00:05:26.419> we<00:05:26.570> will<00:05:26.720> switch<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.230> one<00:05:27.410> there

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
hosting so we will switch that one there

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.440 
hosting so we will switch that one there
to<00:05:27.950> high<00:05:28.160> velocity<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:28.880> we'll<00:05:29.030> give<00:05:29.240> this<00:05:29.390> one

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
to high velocity and we'll give this one

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.830 
to high velocity and we'll give this one
more<00:05:29.840> test<00:05:30.110> on<00:05:30.320> both<00:05:30.350> sides<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.720> Verizon<00:05:32.720> has

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
more test on both sides so Verizon has

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.300 
more test on both sides so Verizon has
won<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.020> couple<00:05:33.260> on<00:05:33.470> default<00:05:33.830> because<00:05:34.040> of<00:05:34.250> the

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
won a couple on default because of the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.280 
won a couple on default because of the
failure<00:05:34.669> of<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:34.850> network<00:05:35.150> on<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.960> upload

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
failure of the network on the upload

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.890 
failure of the network on the upload
from<00:05:36.650> t-mobile<00:05:37.070> but<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.180> overall<00:05:38.450> download

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
from t-mobile but the overall download

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.980 
from t-mobile but the overall download
speeds<00:05:39.200> are<00:05:39.410> pretty<00:05:39.680> much<00:05:40.030> unarguable<00:05:41.030> for

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
speeds are pretty much unarguable for

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.150 
speeds are pretty much unarguable for
both<00:05:42.370> means<00:05:43.370> Verizon<00:05:43.729> is<00:05:43.850> still<00:05:44.150> good<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.600> mean

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
both means Verizon is still good I mean

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.330 
both means Verizon is still good I mean
at<00:05:46.160> 7<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:46.850> 8<00:05:47.000> Meg's<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.510> mean<00:05:47.770> that's<00:05:48.770> solid<00:05:49.220> but

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
at 7 and 8 Meg's I mean that's solid but

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.100 
at 7 and 8 Meg's I mean that's solid but
I<00:05:49.370> mean<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.970> t-mobile<00:05:50.390> one<00:05:50.600> is<00:05:50.720> in<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.960> red

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
I mean the t-mobile one is in the red

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.620 
I mean the t-mobile one is in the red
like<00:05:51.320> I<00:05:51.440> said<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.550> is<00:05:52.669> just<00:05:52.880> I<00:05:53.150> mean<00:05:53.419> the

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
like I said and that is just I mean the

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.969 
like I said and that is just I mean the
the<00:05:54.020> data<00:05:54.350> speeds<00:05:54.830> from<00:05:55.100> t-mobile<00:05:55.520> are

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
the data speeds from t-mobile are

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.930 
the data speeds from t-mobile are
ridiculous<00:05:57.979> now<00:05:58.160> whether<00:05:58.430> their<00:05:58.640> network

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
ridiculous now whether their network

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.610 
ridiculous now whether their network
holds<00:05:59.210> up<00:05:59.330> on<00:05:59.419> the<00:05:59.570> upload<00:05:59.930> if<00:06:00.110> it's<00:06:00.289> failing

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
holds up on the upload if it's failing

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.050 
holds up on the upload if it's failing
or<00:06:00.890> if<00:06:00.979> they're<00:06:01.100> hitting<00:06:01.310> peak<00:06:01.520> time<00:06:01.820> right

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
or if they're hitting peak time right

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.700 
or if they're hitting peak time right
now<00:06:02.210> which<00:06:02.390> is<00:06:02.510> closer<00:06:02.750> it's<00:06:03.050> 5<00:06:03.200> o'clock<00:06:03.500> to

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
now which is closer it's 5 o'clock to

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.469 
now which is closer it's 5 o'clock to
have<00:06:03.800> to<00:06:03.919> work<00:06:04.100> for<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.340> lot<00:06:04.460> of<00:06:04.550> people

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
have to work for a lot of people

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.239 
have to work for a lot of people
and<00:06:05.599> the<00:06:05.900> network<00:06:06.199> has<00:06:06.379> a<00:06:06.409> lot<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.710> load<00:06:06.949> on<00:06:06.979> it

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
and the network has a lot of load on it

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:10.420 
and the network has a lot of load on it
right<00:06:07.400> now<00:06:07.550> for<00:06:07.789> both<00:06:07.909> of<00:06:08.120> these<00:06:08.210> guys<00:06:09.370> but<00:06:10.370> it

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
right now for both of these guys but it

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.469 
right now for both of these guys but it
looks<00:06:10.580> like<00:06:10.699> it<00:06:10.849> may<00:06:10.939> have<00:06:11.059> just<00:06:11.090> been<00:06:11.360> a

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
looks like it may have just been a

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.450 
looks like it may have just been a
server<00:06:11.809> issue<00:06:12.050> with<00:06:12.409> that<00:06:12.439> data<00:06:12.860> tester<00:06:13.309> and

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
server issue with that data tester and

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.219 
server issue with that data tester and
that's<00:06:13.639> what<00:06:13.789> it<00:06:13.849> looks<00:06:13.879> like<00:06:14.150> here<00:06:14.449> so<00:06:14.599> we're

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
that's what it looks like here so we're

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.689 
that's what it looks like here so we're
gonna<00:06:15.319> give<00:06:15.529> one<00:06:15.800> more<00:06:15.949> test<00:06:16.219> we'll<00:06:16.460> make<00:06:16.610> that

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
gonna give one more test we'll make that

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.059 
gonna give one more test we'll make that
our<00:06:16.849> final<00:06:17.270> test<00:06:17.509> three<00:06:18.139> two<00:06:18.830> one

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
our final test three two one

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:28.839 
our final test three two one
for<00:06:22.069> Verizon<00:06:22.550> and<00:06:22.759> t-mobile<00:06:27.309> and<00:06:28.309> I<00:06:28.550> mean<00:06:28.699> it's

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
for Verizon and t-mobile and I mean it's

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.029 
for Verizon and t-mobile and I mean it's
it's<00:06:29.629> really<00:06:29.930> not<00:06:30.050> even<00:06:30.199> close

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
it's really not even close

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.369 
it's really not even close
it<00:06:31.400> really<00:06:31.580> isn't<00:06:32.029> not<00:06:32.270> in<00:06:32.569> data<00:06:32.930> download

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:33.379 
it really isn't not in data download

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.429 
it really isn't not in data download
speed<00:06:33.650> or<00:06:33.979> ping<00:06:34.509> so<00:06:35.509> from<00:06:35.930> what<00:06:36.050> I'm<00:06:36.169> seeing

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
speed or ping so from what I'm seeing

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.050 
speed or ping so from what I'm seeing
right<00:06:36.529> here<00:06:36.919> and<00:06:37.069> looking<00:06:37.279> at<00:06:37.430> this<00:06:37.610> right<00:06:37.819> now

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
right here and looking at this right now

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.140 
right here and looking at this right now
I<00:06:38.330> mean<00:06:38.569> t-mobile<00:06:39.249> is<00:06:40.249> dis<00:06:40.550> obliterating

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
I mean t-mobile is dis obliterating

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.260 
I mean t-mobile is dis obliterating
Verizon<00:06:41.689> in<00:06:41.870> data<00:06:42.550> hands-down<00:06:43.550> I<00:06:43.939> mean

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
Verizon in data hands-down I mean

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.820 
Verizon in data hands-down I mean
there's<00:06:44.419> not<00:06:44.509> even<00:06:44.569> it's<00:06:44.990> it's<00:06:45.229> not<00:06:45.379> even<00:06:45.499> it's

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
not even a conversation the ping is

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:51.909 
not even a conversation the ping is
almost<00:06:48.650> half<00:06:49.039> the<00:06:49.300> half<00:06:50.300> the<00:06:50.539> time<00:06:50.779> and<00:06:51.139> the

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
almost half the half the time and the

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.980 
almost half the half the time and the
download<00:06:52.310> speeds<00:06:52.669> are<00:06:52.939> amazing<00:06:53.539> the<00:06:53.689> upload

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
download speeds are amazing the upload

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.439 
download speeds are amazing the upload
speeds<00:06:54.289> are<00:06:54.409> kind<00:06:54.589> of<00:06:54.620> comparable<00:06:55.449> though

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
speeds are kind of comparable though

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.709 
speeds are kind of comparable though
t-mobile<00:06:57.020> almost<00:06:57.349> has<00:06:57.499> double<00:06:57.979> those<00:06:58.159> as<00:06:58.399> well

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
t-mobile almost has double those as well

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.219 
t-mobile almost has double those as well
but<00:06:59.740> overall<00:07:00.740> I<00:07:00.860> mean<00:07:00.949> there<00:07:01.699> it<00:07:01.789> is<00:07:01.909> I<00:07:02.180> mean<00:07:02.719> we

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:03.229 
but overall I mean there it is I mean we

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.450 
but overall I mean there it is I mean we
can<00:07:03.319> go<00:07:03.439> through<00:07:03.589> the<00:07:03.680> results<00:07:05.319> and<00:07:06.339> there<00:07:07.339> you

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
can go through the results and there you

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.839 
can go through the results and there you
have<00:07:07.490> it

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
have it

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:15.119

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:15.129 
I mean 33 34 30 31 32 it really is not

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:20.769 
I mean 33 34 30 31 32 it really is not
even<00:07:16.129> close<00:07:16.819> at<00:07:17.300> all<00:07:17.689> here<00:07:19.270> for<00:07:20.270> Verizon

unfortunately and you can see they're

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.670 
unfortunately and you can see they're
not<00:07:22.849> breaking<00:07:23.060> 15<00:07:23.689> Meg's<00:07:23.959> anywhere<00:07:24.439> in<00:07:24.560> the
