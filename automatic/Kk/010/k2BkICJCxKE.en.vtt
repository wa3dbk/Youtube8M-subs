00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
groove in the koornwinder adapter that's

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.779 
groove in the koornwinder adapter that's
appropriate<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.380> type<00:01:24.069> of<00:01:24.099> comb<00:01:24.580> that

you're<00:01:24.970> using<00:01:25.709> with<00:01:26.709> the<00:01:26.979> grooves<00:01:27.280> towards

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
you're using with the grooves towards

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.880 
you're using with the grooves towards
the<00:01:28.360> inside<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.869> get<00:01:32.110> your<00:01:32.349> cone<00:01:32.590> they're

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
the inside you get your cone they're

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.499 
the inside you get your cone they're
nice<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.160> tight<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.920> bobbin<00:01:36.520> winder<00:01:36.970> you

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
nice and tight this bobbin winder you

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.059 
nice and tight this bobbin winder you
can<00:01:37.690> adapt<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.880> adjust<00:01:39.880> them<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.740> forth

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
can adapt to adjust them back and forth

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.080 
can adapt to adjust them back and forth
and<00:01:42.310> things<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.780> theirs<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:45.250> it's<00:01:45.429> holds<00:01:45.970> it

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
and things like theirs so it's holds it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.870 
and things like theirs so it's holds it
tight<00:01:46.569> nicely<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:50.110> want<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.880> clip

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
tight nicely then you want I is a clip

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.089 
tight nicely then you want I is a clip
like<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.179> just<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:56.110> avoid<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.679> friction

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
like this just to avoid the friction

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.240 
like this just to avoid the friction
over<00:01:57.369> my<00:01:57.550> finger<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:59.050> way<00:01:59.319> I<00:01:59.349> can<00:01:59.830> get<00:02:00.009> a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
over my finger that way I can get a

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.960 
over my finger that way I can get a
tight<00:02:00.610> cone<00:02:01.030> without<00:02:01.509> burning<00:02:01.989> my<00:02:02.349> finger

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
tight cone without burning my finger

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.249 
tight cone without burning my finger
otherwise<00:02:03.970> either<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> burn<00:02:05.890> or<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:07.259> very

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
otherwise either get a burn or a very

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.270 
otherwise either get a burn or a very
loose<00:02:08.619> cone<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.190> yarn<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.759> don't<00:02:09.970> want

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
loose cone of yarn and I don't want

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.430 
loose cone of yarn and I don't want
yeah<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:13.490> make<00:02:13.760> sure<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:14.450> manually<00:02:15.200> you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
yeah just make sure that manually you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.690 
yeah just make sure that manually you
get<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.800> started<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:18.380> couple<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.980> turns

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
get it started just a couple of turns

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.310 
get it started just a couple of turns
just<00:02:20.740> start<00:02:21.740> with<00:02:22.240> some<00:02:23.240> other<00:02:23.450> people<00:02:23.780> just

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
just start with some other people just

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.880 
just start with some other people just
put<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.710> piece<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.340> tape<00:02:25.730> here<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.770> start<00:02:27.770> it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
put a piece of tape here and start it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.570 
put a piece of tape here and start it
that<00:02:28.070> way

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
that way

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
that way
it's<00:02:28.790> up<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.330> how<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.870> want<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.320> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it's up to you how do you want to do it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.070 
it's up to you how do you want to do it
and<00:02:31.600> here<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.900> important<00:02:33.380> part<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.070> build

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
and here the important part is to build

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.240 
and here the important part is to build
slowly<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.980> don't<00:02:37.100> want<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.459> go<00:02:37.610> too<00:02:38.060> fast<00:02:39.250> but

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
slowly you don't want to go too fast but

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.740 
slowly you don't want to go too fast but
you<00:02:40.730> know<00:02:40.880> one<00:02:41.090> go<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.990> snow<00:02:42.410> either<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.600> you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
you know one go to snow either so you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.460 
you know one go to snow either so you
first<00:02:45.200> feel<00:02:45.590> kind<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.370> skeleton<00:02:47.470> without

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
first feel kind of a skeleton without

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.090 
first feel kind of a skeleton without
going<00:02:48.860> below<00:02:49.840> about<00:02:50.840> 3/4<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.470> an<00:02:51.650> inch<00:02:51.680> here

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
going below about 3/4 of an inch here

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.600 
going below about 3/4 of an inch here
and<00:02:52.330> 3/4<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.420> an<00:02:53.570> inch<00:02:53.690> here<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.340> cone

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and 3/4 of an inch here so the cone

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.090 
and 3/4 of an inch here so the cone
doesn't<00:02:56.030> overflow<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.900> collapse<00:02:57.739> is<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
doesn't overflow and collapse is the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.650 
doesn't overflow and collapse is the
only<00:02:58.250> thing<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:59.510> then<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.500> keep<00:03:00.739> going

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
only thing and then you just keep going

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.340 
only thing and then you just keep going
like<00:03:02.660> winding<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.590> regular<00:03:04.130> bobbin<00:03:05.290> for<00:03:06.290> a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
like winding a regular bobbin for a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
like winding a regular bobbin for a
shuttle<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:12.110> have<00:03:12.230> done<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.739> past<00:03:12.980> or

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
shuttle or you have done in the past or

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.039 
shuttle or you have done in the past or
a<00:03:13.400> quilt<00:03:13.760> even<00:03:15.370> there<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.549> go
