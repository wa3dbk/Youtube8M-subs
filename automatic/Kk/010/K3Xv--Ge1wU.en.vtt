his<00:04:24.659> leg<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.050> thought<00:04:25.199> he

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
his leg I thought he

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.860 
his leg I thought he
but<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.010> think<00:04:26.220> if<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.430> take<00:04:26.580> off<00:04:26.790> as<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> jacket

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
but I think if you take off as a jacket

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.550 
but I think if you take off as a jacket
because<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.410> took<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.740> off<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.580> one<00:04:29.850> here

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
because I took it off and this one here

he<00:04:31.560> does<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:31.890> his<00:04:31.920> tattoos<00:04:32.400> on<00:04:32.580> there<00:04:32.760> I

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
he does have his tattoos on there I

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.870 
he does have his tattoos on there I
believe<00:04:33.650> even<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:34.740> he<00:04:34.830> opened<00:04:35.160> up<00:04:35.220> his<00:04:35.280> shirt<00:04:35.670> I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
believe even if he opened up his shirt I

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.970
