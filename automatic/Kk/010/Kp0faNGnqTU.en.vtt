00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.320
 rotations must be maintained if it is a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.969
 year spring has gone bad 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.080
 clearly it is not reason why it must 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.660
 to repeat itself the following year 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.030
 so make wheat skis but definitely 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.770
 respecting the rotation as far as 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.670
 concerns the techniques 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.039
 we come with an extremely year 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.740
 extremely aredo with land 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.070
 really at the limit of total blindness 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.210
 so we don't have water in the country and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.010
 there are soils that also makes us 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.989
 struggling to work for this reason 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.059
 what the biggest problem is 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.649
 clearly the residues the rice of where 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.679
 we must integrate them because it is clear that 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.749
 after soy after chard I don't have big ones 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.569
 problems i'm not doing roadways i 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.249
 soils are enough we say suitable 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.620
 also for sowing on hard and minimum 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.749
 ration the different discourse if we talk 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.749
 of later sorghum or after corn 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.359
 how come because there is so much stiffness there 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.979
 very residual that in many cases can 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.860
 become an obstacle precisely for the 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.170
 agronomic operations themselves maize 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.960
 we have different situations perhaps 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.689
 where we made corn from cirrhosis and which 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.299
 so we brought the residues of one 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.920
 situation also suitable for cultivation 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.899
 maybe even the minimum version 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.430
 clearly instead where we have three 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.020
 biato and therefore we have the residue a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.539
 important residue we must clearly 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.090
 burying it we must avoid sowing 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.640
 over the residues and why it would become 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.409
 clearly source of inoculation for how much 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.359
 it affects all pathogenic diseases then 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.159
 to say that we will have springs in the winter and 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.409
 then also regarding the good 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.840
 succeeded as an emergency in one 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.210
 situation as there is behind me mi 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.249
 I refer to sorghum in this case 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.850
 absolutely avoid sowing on 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.740
 hard we rise let's say compared to corn and 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.719
 even a little more complicated is just one 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.509
 trevi vault for hunting hunting bulls 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.740
 immediately then diversity and then 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.960
 what he managed to threshing 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.729
 we are within a few weeks can 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 double then can reach 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.710
 really important levels of 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.999
 levels from where even the intervention 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.520
 of the residue becomes extremely 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.420
 difficult and complicated if not in some 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.310
 unachievable case 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.230
 therefore clear that these surely 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.840
 worst situation to deal with 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.900
 sowing on hard and minimum processing or 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 I am rarely the land that is today 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.860
 feasible only in loose soils 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.060
 the media lands below where we say 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.430
 the operation of nature therefore 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.020
 the intervention succeeds quite well but 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 if I go to tackle clay soils 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.250
 where certain areas even exceeds 60 per 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.410
 the clay content is one hundred 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.420
 clearly I can't succeed because then 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.590
 I could not refine the land and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.349
 so it really becomes them 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.260
 unacceptable to make wheat in those 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.360
 conditions but if there are many indeed 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.430
 crop residues what happens 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.489
 because the seed is not born which are i 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.500
 problems but there is a problem of nature 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.660
 mechanics in the sense that together with that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.220
 point there is not deposed we say in the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.160
 ground then in contact with the ground but 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.459
 many times it is deposited on the residue 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.319
 if we talk about corn and or sorghum it comes 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.150
 place on the leaves on the bratti that 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.310
 these are like wanting foil 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.380
 together then it becomes a problem either 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.760
 as related to emergencies and then 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.260
 also with regard to all 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.420
 fungal diseases that will then go 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.630
 develop in the phase of 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.370
 degradation of the residue will give 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.980
 develop and contaminate clearly 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.410
 I read the maps so it's really 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.299
 a situation that we then risk having 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.459
 of the product beyond what it can 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.920
 be the positive factor but also 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.510
 really bad quality too 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 because the seeders on that hard 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.560
 we have in our area are 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.170
 different than for example those 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.180
 Argentine our interior perhaps 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.820
 when they do in a prayer mixing 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.829
 the seed with the soil with the residue 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.470
 concert instead of sowing we say 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.290
 overseas is to have cars 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.569
 sowing under the residue therefore not 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.100
 go and bury remaining residue remains 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.870
 completely off the field because 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.359
 together in this case it is placed below 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.400
 the residue therefore does not go anyway 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.540
 contact of the successful residue remains 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.000
 on the outside 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.430
 so it definitely has a power for 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.109
 regarding a lower oculus 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.150
 staying outside because it doesn't come to 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.459
 contact our fools instead 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.590
 toppers average entering its 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.900
 together with contact with residue 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.880
 in short, we must not get caught up in the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.720
 all the costs of sowing wheat 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.670
 also on firm 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.160
 conditions otherwise you risk 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.840
 not doing production it is clear how 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.580
 they say you have to respect them rotation 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.840
 we must put the vintage behind us 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.240
 difficult that we had for the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.450
 spring hoping they have it then 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.090
 must come it is clearly better 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.500
 I would like to remind everyone that if 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.500
 let's go back a few years ago there 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.150
 considered wheat as a culture is 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.060
 a necessary evil in the sense of why 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.130
 maybe corn beets or not they offered 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.400
 more then I was considered wheat 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.120
 as is necessary to make the rotation 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.790
 suddenly we can't 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.320
 consider it let's say as the panacea for 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.390
 so we all have to keep it 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.730
 rotation this year went well 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.200
 wheat and corn could be bad 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.200
 next year the opposite
