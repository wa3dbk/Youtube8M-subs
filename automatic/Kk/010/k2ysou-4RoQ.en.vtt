00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:25.840
 I'll show you how I did it. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:31.160
 this whole dress in spike triangles 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.190
 note that it is with a triangle 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:42.520
 the spike is not 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.520
 everything on paper is a paper glue 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.720
 these triangles you can see here 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 here is an amount for all this 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.040
 dress took over 250 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.939
 spirits more than 250 years 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.150
 so I could not cut them the scissors 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.310
 do not squeeze sisters and not by hand 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.430
 like me 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.540
 I work in a graphic industry, we 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.390
 we make this knife a professional 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.650
 in which he executed the knife and we 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.320
 then cut there in the company 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.970
 all these parents to me power is 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.840
 composing the dress I'll show 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.260
 basically for you how does he 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.979
 was done first we had to 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.420
 get a tool here 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.030
 here you are seeing they are already 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.549
 crease the management of the folded in pre- 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.690
 actually they came in handy. 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.830
 plans 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:57.380
 I needed to be doing all the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:02.510
 sides of his folding do this 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.670
 bond is to tighten the crease of all 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.039
 sides so that the time I was to paste 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.870
 The thing works so I'll be 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.230
 showing you all was all you 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.480
 oriented does not really have much 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.960
 secret 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.270
 He was here 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.450
 after the links already had everything 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:33.330
 signed right made us fit together here 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.500
 and in the end I already passed a handle a 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.500
 pre glued here 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:59.670
 It was already stuck before I closed it here. 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:02.010
 the closing here I passed glue here already 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:08.670
 I was driving fast inside. 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 held tight and ready for 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.090
 get a little here so you can see the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.850
 traffic always lower tab I left the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.960
 end so I came the first thing 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.960
 What do you think? 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:43.040
 closed that side already plotting to bring 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:47.940
 fit the school there and then 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.470
 but with spy ready I'll get it here 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.470
 a piece of this cycle 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:06.450
 You want the way I did, it was not much. 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.190
 simple to make this collage pick up a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.440
 Other dismounted here I'll show you 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.980
 You guys, I had to do the finishing. 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.200
 Internal them because as it is all in 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.560
 time that people put cola to cola 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:29.910
 on the other side and I'll show you 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:32.450
 here is only this car for you and 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.370
 paste and do it 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.800
 the dress was already on 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.840
 on the mannequin that served me well for 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.520
 I have notion of location, but I do not 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.470
 I liked this finish that was 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.140
 internally a rough finish 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:54.090
 So what I did then there was 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:05:00.870
 invested inside out all the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:02.490
 collages and put a finish on 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.900
 all of them 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.600
 he got well finished and firm 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.220
 Hold you can hold style by 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.490
 spac why he went there and to 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.620
 here and did not fall or on the catwalk he was 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:23.580
 very firm and nice this was a piece 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:30.570
 conceptual she ended up in the magazine 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:32.820
 in the newspaper in the column of a columnist 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.800
 of the newspaper here in the city also because 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.080
 really was a pretty piece 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.580
 conceptual I'll show you 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.680
 now what i did 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:47.069
 these colorful packages that were the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:50.449
 accessory that this girl used to show 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.449
 To you how I made this bag. 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:06:01.409
 this bag was made as follows 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:03.900
 I got a bigger role at the end so far 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.030
 the king this credit paper and kaka and the 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.300
 black paper where there was a bag here 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.370
 inside I have the earrings that I also 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.370
 concocted lasted just 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.129
 the earrings that these girls models 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.669
 used on that day but she entered 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:26.280
 with this bag and she had to have a 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.690
 same link then what i did i too 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.629
 developed 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.960
 at the moment we're cutting those 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:39.599
 black parents we've already cut them in 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.900
 colors of the collection in the same way I 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:48.629
 who sticking I had in n possibility 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:51.120
 to do it here but here we 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.849
 we develop know you then this was the 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.319
 purse model is the wallet right 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:07:01.199
 purse-wallet either model paraded 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:03.810
 this day was somewhat different and 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:08.069
 exclusive and fairly conceptual within 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:12.770
 of the topic that was proposed the theme semics 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.770
 cyan magenta yellow and black 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:18.779
 the accessories I also bought a 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:21.479
 differentiated product and do not have 

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:24.050
 also with this same line is this 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.050
 same information 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:29.150
 Okay, what 's another project for? 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:29.150
