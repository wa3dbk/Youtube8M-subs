00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this alone it'll stick it'll stick right

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.590 
this alone it'll stick it'll stick right
to<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> case<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.570> here

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to that right to the case right here

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.749 
to that right to the case right here
with<00:01:43.140> these<00:01:43.290> magnets<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.340> guys<00:01:44.460> what

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
with these magnets and you guys what

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.370 
with these magnets and you guys what
I've<00:01:44.850> realized<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.390> learning<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> passes

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
I've realized to learning the passes

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
I've realized to learning the passes
it's<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:46.829> best<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> stick<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> phone<00:01:47.820> in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it's probably best to stick a phone in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's probably best to stick a phone in
with<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> volume<00:01:48.990> buttons<00:01:49.409> first<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.090> any

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
with the volume buttons first in any

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
with the volume buttons first in any
case<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.009> ahead<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
case but let's go ahead and put this in

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.330 
case but let's go ahead and put this in

mirror<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.530> can<00:04:11.590> actually<00:04:11.890> use<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.489> see<00:04:12.850> my

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
mirror so you can actually use it see my

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.460 
mirror so you can actually use it see my
camera<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:13.570> can<00:04:13.600> actually<00:04:13.810> use<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.320> as<00:04:14.440> a

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
camera you can actually use it as a

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.509 
camera you can actually use it as a
mirror<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.880> that's<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:16.390> one<00:04:17.230> added<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.130> little

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
mirror so that's just one added a little

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.670 
mirror so that's just one added a little
extra<00:04:18.820> functionality<00:04:19.539> there<00:04:19.900> now<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.410> only

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
extra functionality there now the only

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.800 
extra functionality there now the only
thing<00:04:20.770> that<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.130> would<00:04:21.220> say<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:22.300> would<00:04:22.630> be

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
thing that I would say is it would be

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.880 
thing that I would say is it would be
cool<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:23.080> they<00:04:23.289> came<00:04:23.500> out<00:04:23.530> with<00:04:23.680> different

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
cool if they came out with different

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.080 
cool if they came out with different
style<00:04:24.340> cases

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
style cases

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.700 
style cases
but<00:04:25.389> this<00:04:25.720> case<00:04:25.960> doesn't<00:04:26.230> bother<00:04:26.440> me<00:04:26.590> that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
but this case doesn't bother me that

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.680 
but this case doesn't bother me that
much<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.250> think<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.520> looks<00:04:27.699> pretty<00:04:27.760> cool<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.510> it

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
much I think it looks pretty cool and it

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.080 
much I think it looks pretty cool and it
feels<00:04:28.750> rugged<00:04:29.680> that's<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.340> most<00:04:30.550> important

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
feels rugged that's the most important

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.120 
feels rugged that's the most important
thing<00:04:31.150> about<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:32.620> is<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.860> it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
thing about this that I like is that it

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.790 
thing about this that I like is that it
it<00:04:33.430> really<00:04:33.669> does<00:04:34.030> feel<00:04:34.270> rugged<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.620> guys

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.230 
it really does feel rugged and you guys

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
can see I know this is gonna make the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.159 
can see I know this is gonna make the
camera<00:04:47.110> wobbly<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.979> can't<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:49.180> can't<00:04:49.660> get<00:04:50.050> it

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
camera wobbly but I can't I can't get it

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.810

off<00:04:50.260> two<00:04:50.620> pretty<00:04:50.830> good<00:04:50.949> magni<00:04:51.340> guys<00:04:51.550> but<00:04:51.790> I

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
off two pretty good magni guys but I

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.010 
off two pretty good magni guys but I
thought<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.150> was<00:04:52.240> important<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.750> show<00:04:52.960> you

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
thought it was important to show you

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.950 
thought it was important to show you
actually<00:04:53.440> how<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.710> works<00:04:53.949> on<00:04:54.540> some<00:04:55.540> jeans<00:04:55.780> or

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
actually how it works on some jeans or

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.750 
actually how it works on some jeans or
whatnot<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.560> can<00:04:56.800> actually<00:04:56.949> just<00:04:57.280> take<00:04:57.490> it

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
whatnot so you can actually just take it

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.670 
whatnot so you can actually just take it
you<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.479> worry<00:04:58.660> about<00:04:58.810> falling<00:04:59.200> off<00:04:59.440> you

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
you have to worry about falling off you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.560 
you have to worry about falling off you
can<00:04:59.800> just<00:04:59.979> grab<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.190> when<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.520> need<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.729> just

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
can just grab it when you need it just

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.020 
can just grab it when you need it just
pull<00:05:01.720> up<00:05:01.750> on<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.229> will<00:05:02.350> come<00:05:02.530> right<00:05:02.710> off<00:05:03.030> it's

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
pull up on it will come right off it's

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.580 
pull up on it will come right off it's
it's<00:05:04.330> crazy<00:05:04.630> because<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.960> comes<00:05:05.169> off<00:05:05.320> really

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
it's crazy because it comes off really

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.120 
it's crazy because it comes off really
easy<00:05:05.970> but<00:05:06.970> it's<00:05:07.210> very<00:05:07.600> very<00:05:08.020> secure<00:05:08.650> as<00:05:08.830> far<00:05:09.040> as

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
easy but it's very very secure as far as

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.790 
easy but it's very very secure as far as
like<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.400> magnetic<00:05:09.910> system<00:05:10.090> goes<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:11.260> I<00:05:11.620> don't

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800
