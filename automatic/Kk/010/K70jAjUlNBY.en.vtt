metal<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.670> wonder<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.270> were<00:01:22.170> taken

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
metal and I wonder if they were taken

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.910 
metal and I wonder if they were taken
away<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.390> they<00:01:24.390> were<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.930> limited

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
away because they were just so limited

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
away because they were just so limited
you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.509> were<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.780> metal<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you know because they were in metal and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.950 
you know because they were in metal and
the<00:01:29.070> metal<00:01:29.369> designs<00:01:30.030> were<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the metal designs were not that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
the metal designs were not that
elaborate<00:01:31.950> when<00:01:32.640> compared<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
elaborate when compared to the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.700 
elaborate when compared to the
historian's<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.200> why<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.470> kept<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
historian's I can see why they kept the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
historian's I can see why they kept the
historian's<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> voice<00:01:35.400> Australians<00:01:36.180> were

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
historian's the voice Australians were

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230 
historian's the voice Australians were
packed<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.960> detail<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.030> pretty

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
packed with detail but it's just pretty

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.620 
packed with detail but it's just pretty
crazy<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.900> um<00:01:40.460> they<00:01:41.460> got<00:01:41.880> rid<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.420> of

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
crazy that um they got rid of all of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600 
crazy that um they got rid of all of
their<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.500> their<00:01:43.619> old<00:01:43.770> metal<00:01:44.040> models<00:01:44.399> I
