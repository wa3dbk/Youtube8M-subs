icing or what you can do is use a edible
marker<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.160> trace<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.090> design<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.750> then

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
marker and trace on the design and then

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.970 
marker and trace on the design and then
just<00:03:30.049> go<00:03:30.170> back<00:03:30.200> over<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:30.890> with<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.190> icing

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
pretty basic but for him to make the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.400 
pretty basic but for him to make the
