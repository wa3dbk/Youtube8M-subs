we<00:01:49.440> why<00:01:49.620> not<00:01:49.800> do<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.670> small

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
we why not do it like this a small

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.200 
we why not do it like this a small
little<00:01:51.510> booklet<00:01:51.960> same<00:01:52.740> information<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:54.090> know

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
little booklet same information you know

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
little booklet same information you know
whenever<00:01:54.480> more<00:01:54.630> information<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
whenever more information go to the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.990 
whenever more information go to the
websites<00:01:55.950> much<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.490> efficient<00:01:56.940> less<00:01:57.600> paper

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
websites much more efficient less paper

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.220 
websites much more efficient less paper
and<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.450> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.690> be<00:02:00.750> serious<00:02:01.140> about

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
and I think we want to be serious about

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.160 
and I think we want to be serious about
our<00:02:01.380> story<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:03.450> want<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.690> show<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
company you are and what we represent

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.090 
company you are and what we represent
and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.120> think<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.420> cool<00:02:06.600> thing<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.230> being<00:02:07.980> an

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
and I think the cool thing just being an
