 well where one can grow and can 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 show what a small city is 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.280
 like a sea of ​​silver is capable of 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.110
 produce things for customers of 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.510

 We will continue traveling and we will 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 hear the word of the boys 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.240

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.740
 this is how we have the kitchen of chile 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.900
 it's a recreation area of ​​rest on 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.850
 computer work is very 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.020
 absorbent one when it is in the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.450
 computer for being many hours 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.250
 sitting and that's not productive one 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.890
 you have to relax you have to do your 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.500
 breaks and we have common spaces for 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.180
 recreation we have spaces for work 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.770
 everyone can be in theirs without 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.900
 disturbing the other is saying here 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.970
 there are many things also of course 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.440
 Of course people when you start 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.060
 interact there are people who work in a 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.080
 area of ​​people who work in another area and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.000
 in these spaces where people 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.950
 interacts and that 's where the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.299
 innovation and that is the factor of 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.609
 global differentiation 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.440
 you do not ask us 10 and we have 12 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.770
 because because in these spaces 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.450
 generate those 2 that we generate 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.490
 let's go inside we keep going 28 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.970
 years we go to 32 we keep going 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.970
