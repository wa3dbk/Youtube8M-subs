hi<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.850> ko<00:00:15.300> gaming<00:00:18.830> very<00:00:19.830> short<00:00:20.580> tutorial

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
hi this is ko gaming very short tutorial

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.810 
hi this is ko gaming very short tutorial
for<00:00:23.070> any<00:00:23.699> research<00:00:24.150> system<00:00:24.980> it<00:00:25.980> has<00:00:26.190> changed

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
for any research system it has changed

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:49.569 
for any research system it has changed
so

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.569 

for<00:00:50.579> example<00:00:51.140> when<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> kiss<00:00:52.769> we<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.370> get

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
for example when you kiss we will get

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.770 
for example when you kiss we will get
the<00:00:53.940> research<00:00:54.360> note<00:00:55.940> but<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the research note but you know where to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410 
the research note but you know where to
get<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:59.010> scribing<00:00:59.670> tools<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
get that you need scribing tools and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.520 
get that you need scribing tools and
paper

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.490 

and<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> mention<00:01:05.880> Skylanders<00:01:06.810> has<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and not to mention Skylanders has to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:20.660 
and not to mention Skylanders has to
have<00:01:07.650> fold<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:18.090> section<00:01:18.690> nice<00:01:19.110> change<00:01:19.670> for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
have fold this section nice change for

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.440 
have fold this section nice change for
paper<00:01:20.940> anymore

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.429 

so<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.549> can<00:01:27.759> see<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.330> can<00:01:28.600> see<00:01:28.840> two

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
so as you can see we can see two

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:36.690 
so as you can see we can see two
prospects<00:01:30.189> here<00:01:30.670> one<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:32.970> fire

here<00:02:18.350> we<00:02:18.560> go<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.700> how<00:02:20.420> do<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:21.130> connect<00:02:22.130> these

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
here we go so how do you connect these

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550 
here we go so how do you connect these
two

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
two

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.180 
two
it's<00:02:25.130> mostly<00:02:25.970> simple

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's mostly simple

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.750 
it's mostly simple
you<00:02:28.730> know<00:02:28.910> life<00:02:29.600> is<00:02:30.190> fire

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
you know life is fire

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.470 
you know life is fire
and<00:02:33.239> air

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
and air

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.620 
and air
so<00:02:36.020> we<00:02:36.410> can<00:02:36.680> assume<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:38.230> fire<00:02:39.230> will<00:02:40.630> connect

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
so we can assume that fire will connect

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.670 
so we can assume that fire will connect
to<00:02:41.810> light

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to light

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.880 
to light
because<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.430> test-firing

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.370 

life<00:02:50.550> will<00:02:50.880> connect<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:52.020> five

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.570 

so<00:02:56.040> what's<00:02:56.490> next

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
so what's next

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.260 
so what's next
normally<00:02:59.470> you<00:03:00.470> want<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.770> think<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:02.060> work

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
normally you want to think that we work

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.790 
normally you want to think that we work
with<00:03:02.480> one<00:03:02.780> aspect<00:03:03.080> here

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.180 

you<00:03:09.340> could<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.480> could<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.920> actually<00:03:11.920> worked

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
you could you could have actually worked

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.580 
you could you could have actually worked
but<00:03:12.640> in<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.210> situation

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
but in this situation

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.110 
but in this situation
I<00:03:14.620> was<00:03:15.370> kind<00:03:16.150> of

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.710 

like<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.980 

each<00:03:26.820> part<00:03:27.820> let's<00:03:28.690> call<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.260> head<00:03:29.530> chain

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
each part let's call this head chain

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.890 
each part let's call this head chain
each<00:03:31.990> part<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:33.070> chain<00:03:33.310> has<00:03:34.210> to<00:03:34.240> have<00:03:34.660> an

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
each part of the chain has to have an

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.790 
each part of the chain has to have an
aspect<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.980> common<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:38.080> this<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.500> fire

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
aspect that is common so this is fire

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.840 
aspect that is common so this is fire
and<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:41.050> connect<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.530> fire<00:03:41.850> and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
and so it can connect a fire and

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.170 
and so it can connect a fire and
therefore<00:03:43.810> fire<00:03:44.710> can<00:03:45.010> connect<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.580> lights<00:03:45.790> by

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
therefore fire can connect the lights by

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.080 
therefore fire can connect the lights by

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
combined in this one it will help two

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.010 
combined in this one it will help two

icons showing air and fire and when you
discover<00:04:46.350> more<00:04:46.980> aspects<00:04:50.000> there<00:04:51.000> will<00:04:51.210> be<00:04:51.410> more

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
discover more aspects there will be more
