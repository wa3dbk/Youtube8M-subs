here it's actually not similar to Asus
Transformer<00:00:22.529> line<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.470> tablet

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859

portion<00:00:26.250> does<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:26.609> separate<00:00:27.150> from<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
portion does not separate from the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.099 
portion does not separate from the
keyboard<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.670> actually<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:30.179> single<00:00:30.750> device

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
keyboard it's actually one single device

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.979 
keyboard it's actually one single device
you<00:00:31.470> cannot<00:00:31.800> detach<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.360> tablet<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you cannot detach the tablet from the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.720 
you cannot detach the tablet from the
keyboard<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.070> how<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.399> looks

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
keyboard so here is how it looks

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.930 
keyboard so here is how it looks
it<00:00:36.059> makes<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.800> relatively<00:00:37.800> bulky<00:00:38.190> devices<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it makes for relatively bulky devices to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
it makes for relatively bulky devices to
it<00:00:39.090> together<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> keyboard<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> we

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it together with the keyboard so we

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
it together with the keyboard so we
guess<00:00:43.739> that's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.160> bit<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> disappointment

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
guess that's a bit of a disappointment

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.110 
guess that's a bit of a disappointment
for<00:00:45.360> some<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
for some of you but you know that's the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
for some of you but you know that's the
full<00:00:48.329> factor<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> LG<00:00:49.820> decided<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> use

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
full factor that the LG decided to use

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.299
