roll then I want to lock in the thumb so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.450 
roll then I want to lock in the thumb so
I<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.160> 360<00:00:39.030> degrees<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.899> go<00:00:40.020> across<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.309> go

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I go 360 degrees I go across and I go

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.869 
I go 360 degrees I go across and I go
360<00:00:42.239> degrees<00:00:42.899> around<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.530> thumb<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.160> loop<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
360 degrees around the thumb I loop it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.740 
360 degrees around the thumb I loop it
and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.539> go<00:00:45.690> under<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> over<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.360> an<00:00:48.480> X

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and I go under and over and I make an X

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
and I go under and over and I make an X
here<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.789> unravel

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
here really just so it doesn't unravel

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.139 
here really just so it doesn't unravel
so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> might<00:00:52.230> make<00:00:52.379> another<00:00:52.410> X<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
so I might make another X just to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.850 
so I might make another X just to
connect<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> two<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.110> when<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.350> boxing<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
connect the two so when you're boxing it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.639 
connect the two so when you're boxing it
doesn't<00:00:56.160> come<00:00:56.280> apart<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.809> finish<00:00:58.289> on

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
doesn't come apart and then I finish on

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.220 
doesn't come apart and then I finish on
the<00:00:59.160> wrist<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.600> tighter<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.079> my

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
the wrist I like to go tighter on my
wrist<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:03.300> tighter<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.960> your

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
wrist because the tighter it is on your

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899

my knuckles in my wrist and then there's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050 
my knuckles in my wrist and then there's
not<00:01:22.020> much<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.280> close<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:23.610> fist

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
fingers pros don't go through the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.340 
fingers pros don't go through the
fingers<00:01:35.090> but<00:01:36.090> professionals<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.900> smaller

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
loop for the thumb is and I go all

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.620 
loop for the thumb is and I go all
around<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.040> make<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.729> padding<00:01:57.390> for

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630

the<00:01:57.689> knuckles<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.680> I'm<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.040> go<00:01:59.219> all

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the knuckles so I'm just gonna go all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.660 
the knuckles so I'm just gonna go all
around<00:01:59.810> about<00:02:00.829> 7<00:02:01.829> times<00:02:02.310> 3<00:02:03.110> 4<00:02:04.280> 5<00:02:05.450> 6<00:02:06.770> 7<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
around about 7 times 3 4 5 6 7 so now I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
around about 7 times 3 4 5 6 7 so now I
just<00:02:09.060> take<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.479> cushion<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> padding

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that I made for the knuckles and I lay

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
that I made for the knuckles and I lay
it<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.360> top<00:02:12.390> across<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.260> Nook

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it on top across the Nook

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
it on top across the Nook
and<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.580> were<00:02:14.670> doing<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:15.090> yourself<00:02:15.180> which

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and if you were doing it yourself which

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.630 
and if you were doing it yourself which
is<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> goal<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.980> would<00:02:17.100> just<00:02:17.250> take<00:02:17.430> your

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
is the goal you would just take your

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.270 
is the goal you would just take your
thumb<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.210> hold<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.290> doesn't<00:02:19.740> move<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
thumb and hold it so it doesn't move and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
thumb and hold it so it doesn't move and
then<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.090> wrap<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.870> other

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
then you can wrap it with your other

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
then you can wrap it with your other
hand<00:02:22.140> he'd<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.740> able<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> pull<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.340> with<00:02:23.370> his

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
hand he'd be able to pull it with his

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.120 
hand he'd be able to pull it with his
other<00:02:23.670> hand<00:02:23.820> around<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.660> stabilize<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.380> okay

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
other hand around to stabilize it okay

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.160 
other hand around to stabilize it okay
now<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:26.520> could<00:02:26.670> let<00:02:26.820> go<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.090> thumb<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.630> now

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
now they could let go the thumb and now

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.740 
now they could let go the thumb and now
I<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.320> go<00:02:28.650> around<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.250> hold<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.600> now

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I just go around to hold it there so now

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.530 
I just go around to hold it there so now
it's<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.050> place<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.400> gonna<00:02:32.550> go<00:02:32.760> over<00:02:33.180> the
