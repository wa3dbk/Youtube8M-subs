00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.070 

when<00:00:06.850> you're<00:00:07.000> welding<00:00:07.240> tubes<00:00:07.689> and<00:00:07.899> pipes

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
when you're welding tubes and pipes

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.009 
when you're welding tubes and pipes
together<00:00:08.469> the<00:00:09.370> hard

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.589 

is<00:00:12.139> getting<00:00:12.620> the<00:00:12.830> fit<00:00:13.099> in<00:00:13.339> the<00:00:13.429> first<00:00:13.730> place

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
is getting the fit in the first place

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.439 
is getting the fit in the first place
so<00:00:16.080> what<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.830> we've<00:00:17.610> got<00:00:17.820> an<00:00:17.970> adjustable

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
so what we do we've got an adjustable

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.769 
so what we do we've got an adjustable
template<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.700> all<00:00:20.700> you<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
template that all you have to do is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
template that all you have to do is
press<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.349> in<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.310> shows<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.730> exactly<00:00:23.759> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
press it in and it shows you exactly the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.620 
press it in and it shows you exactly the
shape<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.560> need<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.919> cut<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.360> slide

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
shape that you need to cut so you slide

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.890 
shape that you need to cut so you slide
it<00:00:27.840> over<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.079> tube<00:00:28.700> trace<00:00:29.700> it<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.720> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it over the tube trace it out and you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.130 
it over the tube trace it out and you
know<00:00:31.380> exactly<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.430> shape<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.940> cut<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.989> each

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
know exactly what shape to cut for each

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
know exactly what shape to cut for each
joint<00:00:34.500> okay<00:00:35.220> so<00:00:35.970> that's<00:00:36.150> pretty<00:00:36.449> simple<00:00:36.780> one

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
joint okay so that's pretty simple one

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.310 
joint okay so that's pretty simple one
you<00:00:37.199> can<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.470> that<00:00:37.680> about<00:00:37.890> 10<00:00:38.040> minutes<00:00:38.960> now<00:00:39.960> if

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you can do that about 10 minutes now if

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
you can do that about 10 minutes now if
you're<00:00:40.589> doing<00:00:40.830> like<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> roll<00:00:41.820> cage<00:00:42.180> where

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you're doing like a roll cage where

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000 
you're doing like a roll cage where
you've<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:43.080> of<00:00:43.110> bracing<00:00:43.650> coming

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you've got a lot of bracing coming

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.820 
you've got a lot of bracing coming
together<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> same<00:00:44.790> spot<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.320> end<00:00:46.500> cuts

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
together at the same spot the end cuts

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.549 
together at the same spot the end cuts
get<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.760> complicated

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
get a little bit more complicated

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.190 
get a little bit more complicated
there's<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> end<00:00:49.890> cut<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> next<00:00:50.700> piece

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
there's the end cut for the next piece

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.110 
there's the end cut for the next piece
and<00:00:52.200> that's<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.910> you're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and that's that one you're going to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.240 
and that's that one you're going to
imagine<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.780> trying<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> eyeball<00:00:55.379> what

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
imagine if you're trying to eyeball what

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
imagine if you're trying to eyeball what
that<00:00:56.460> looks<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.780> long<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> would

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that looks like and how long it would

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.840 
that looks like and how long it would
take<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.940> yeah<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.140> trace<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.770> cut

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
take you yeah this is just trace and cut

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
take you yeah this is just trace and cut
slip<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.000> over<00:01:03.120> trace<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.229> know

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
slip it over trace it out you know

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
slip it over trace it out you know
exactly<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:05.070> shape<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> cut<00:01:05.700> shouldn't<00:01:06.660> take

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
exactly what shape to cut shouldn't take

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.110 
exactly what shape to cut shouldn't take
you<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.050> than<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.560> 15<00:01:08.160> minutes

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
you more than about 15 minutes

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
you more than about 15 minutes
oh<00:01:10.790> plasma<00:01:11.790> cutter<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> die<00:01:12.480> grinder<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
oh plasma cutter and a die grinder you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.280 
oh plasma cutter and a die grinder you
just<00:01:13.380> set<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.760> here's<00:01:15.210> where<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.930> pays

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just set so here's where it really pays

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.700 
just set so here's where it really pays
off<00:01:16.790> if<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.150> wanted<00:01:18.480> to<00:01:18.600> put<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> tube<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
off if you wanted to put a tube in you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.880 
off if you wanted to put a tube in you
don't<00:01:19.950> cut<00:01:20.550> just<00:01:20.940> one<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.420> you've<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> cut

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
don't cut just one in you've got to cut

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
don't cut just one in you've got to cut
both<00:01:23.160> in<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> here's<00:01:24.690> how<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:24.930> lay<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.350> both

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
both in so here's how to lay out both

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
both in so here's how to lay out both
ends<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.280> tube<00:01:26.520> before<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.480> ever<00:01:27.630> make<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
ends of the tube before you ever make a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.100 
ends of the tube before you ever make a
cut<00:01:28.310> cut<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.640> ends<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.930> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
cut cut the two ends put it in and it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.320 
cut cut the two ends put it in and it's
ready<00:01:31.230> to<00:01:31.470> weld

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
ready to weld

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.150 
ready to weld
say<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:33.420> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.690> put<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.870> tube<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.740> elbow

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
say I want to put a tube from this elbow

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.730 
say I want to put a tube from this elbow
down<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> table

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
down to the table

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.510 
down to the table
what<00:01:38.250> I'd<00:01:38.400> do<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:39.630> take<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.409> scraps<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.100> tubing

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
what I'd do is take two scraps of tubing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.649 
what I'd do is take two scraps of tubing
and<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.630> scrap<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.170> angle<00:01:43.560> iron<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:45.450> make

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and a scrap of angle iron and I make

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.310 
and a scrap of angle iron and I make
basically<00:01:46.409> an<00:01:46.590> adjustable<00:01:47.250> length<00:01:47.430> tube<00:01:48.320> so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
basically an adjustable length tube so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.990 
basically an adjustable length tube so
I'll<00:01:49.470> come<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.340> say<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
where I want the real tube to go slide

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719 
where I want the real tube to go slide
them<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> where<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.750> touch<00:01:55.549> make<00:01:56.549> sure

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

take<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> same<00:02:09.890> piece<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.340> angle<00:02:10.550> iron

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
take the same piece of angle iron

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.380 
take the same piece of angle iron
and<00:02:13.080> put<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> center<00:02:13.890> line<00:02:14.100> down<00:02:14.460> these<00:02:15.150> two

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and put a center line down these two

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.280 
and put a center line down these two
tubes<00:02:15.920> okay<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:18.330> reason<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> center

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
tubes okay the reason for the center

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.770 
tubes okay the reason for the center
line<00:02:19.500> we're<00:02:20.340> gonna<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.610> perfect<00:02:21.090> cuts<00:02:21.330> but

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
line we're gonna have perfect cuts but

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.930 
line we're gonna have perfect cuts but
if<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.050> twist<00:02:22.410> them<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.920> relationship<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.910> each

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
if we twist them in relationship to each

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.350 
if we twist them in relationship to each
other<00:02:24.270> they're<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.710> fit<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:30.120> got

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
other they're not going to fit you got

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.010 
other they're not going to fit you got
it<00:02:30.540> here's<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:30.840> center<00:02:31.290> line<00:02:31.550> there's<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.640> gap

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
it here's my center line there's a gap

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.170 
it here's my center line there's a gap
I'm<00:02:34.020> gonna<00:02:34.260> follow<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.860> right<00:02:35.790> up<00:02:36.000> that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
I'm gonna follow that right up that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.910 
I'm gonna follow that right up that
center<00:02:36.570> line<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.020> put<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.710> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
center line that I put on this on the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.190 
center line that I put on this on the
stub<00:02:38.570> I'll<00:02:39.570> make<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.200> pattern<00:02:40.770> like<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.200> now

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
stub I'll make up a pattern like so now

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.260 
stub I'll make up a pattern like so now
here's<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.530> trick<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.580> take<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> silver

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
here's the trick you take a silver

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.540 
here's the trick you take a silver
sharpie<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:45.900> something<00:02:46.380> similar<00:02:46.740> then<00:02:47.460> you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
sharpie or something similar then you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.450 
sharpie or something similar then you
put<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> small<00:02:48.180> dot<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.380> gap<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:50.130> here

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
put a small dot in this gap right here

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.910 
put a small dot in this gap right here
right<00:02:50.700> behind<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.150> plastic<00:02:51.600> housing<00:02:51.920> because

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
right behind the plastic housing because

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.200 
right behind the plastic housing because
that's<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> tell<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.700> how<00:02:53.820> long<00:02:54.030> to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
that's going to tell you how long to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.900 
that's going to tell you how long to
make<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.570> piece

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
make this piece

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.710 
make this piece
so<00:02:57.190> here's<00:02:58.190> my<00:02:58.370> material<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.150> want<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.510> cut

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
so here's my material that I want to cut

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.070 
so here's my material that I want to cut
I've<00:03:00.470> put<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.800> centerline<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.080> slipped

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
I've put a centerline on it I slipped

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.590 
I've put a centerline on it I slipped

and<00:03:27.659> now<00:03:27.810> all<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.079> have<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.319> do<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.620> take<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> tape

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
and now all I have to do is take a tape

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.759 
and now all I have to do is take a tape
measure<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.670> measure<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.030> from<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.390> point

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
measure and measure it from this point

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.649

stub

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.910 

it's<00:03:36.480> exactly<00:03:36.900> how<00:03:37.140> long<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.860> be

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
it's exactly how long it's going to be

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.540 
it's exactly how long it's going to be
suppose<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.330> 7<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.960> 7/16<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.980> an<00:03:41.070> inch<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
suppose this is 7 and 7/16 of an inch I

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.240 
suppose this is 7 and 7/16 of an inch I
mean<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.330> measure<00:03:42.540> really<00:03:43.380> accurately

a perfect fit you put it on your tube

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.000 
a perfect fit you put it on your tube
okay<00:03:49.960> remember<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.200> dot<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.410> left<00:03:51.770> up<00:03:51.980> here

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
okay remember the dot I left up here

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.430 
okay remember the dot I left up here
I'll<00:03:52.970> measure<00:03:53.240> out<00:03:53.510> seven<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:54.110> seven

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
I'll measure out seven and seven

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.370 
I'll measure out seven and seven
sixteenths<00:03:55.210> slide<00:03:56.210> the<00:03:56.450> tool<00:03:56.660> back<00:03:56.960> so<00:03:57.260> it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
sixteenths slide the tool back so it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.920 
sixteenths slide the tool back so it
touches<00:03:57.970> make<00:03:58.970> sure<00:03:59.150> I'm<00:03:59.270> on<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.480> center<00:03:59.900> line

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
touches make sure I'm on the center line

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.479 
touches make sure I'm on the center line
and<00:04:00.470> now<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.130> lay<00:04:01.460> out<00:04:01.670> this<00:04:02.090> head

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
and now I lay out this head

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.550 
and now I lay out this head
so<00:04:03.790> what<00:04:04.000> I've<00:04:04.180> got<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.659> tube<00:04:05.019> that's<00:04:05.290> got

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
so what I've got is a tube that's got

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.920 
so what I've got is a tube that's got
layout<00:04:06.310> for<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.730> perfect<00:04:07.269> cut
