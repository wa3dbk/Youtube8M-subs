00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
so the first what you're trying to do is

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.730 
so the first what you're trying to do is
build<00:00:03.720> what's<00:00:03.899> called<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.110> behavior<00:00:04.500> change

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
build what's called a behavior change

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.450 
build what's called a behavior change
mm-hmm<00:00:05.520> so<00:00:06.830> one<00:00:07.830> thing<00:00:08.069> leads<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.370> another

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
mm-hmm so one thing leads to another

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.680 
mm-hmm so one thing leads to another
thing<00:00:08.820> leads<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> another<00:00:09.120> team<00:00:09.450> leads<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
thing leads to another team leads to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.030 
thing leads to another team leads to
another<00:00:09.840> thing<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.440> logical<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
another thing so it's logical for the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.190 
another thing so it's logical for the
horse<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.340> follow<00:00:11.550> along<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.719> first<00:00:12.960> one

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
horse to follow along so the first one

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.010 
horse to follow along so the first one
is<00:00:13.230> smile<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.360> say<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is smile so what you do is you say you

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.570 
is smile so what you do is you say you
tickle<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> lip<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.250> you've<00:00:17.400> got

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
tickle the lip like that and you've got

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.050 
tickle the lip like that and you've got
the<00:00:17.760> tree<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> say<00:00:19.050> smile<00:00:19.350> smile<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.970> he

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the tree here you say smile smile so he

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
the tree here you say smile smile so he
lifts<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> lip<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:24.920> there<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.340> then

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
lifts the lip just a bit there and then

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.179 
lifts the lip just a bit there and then
gets<00:00:26.849> an<00:00:26.970> immediate<00:00:27.150> reward<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.490> can

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
gets an immediate reward and you can

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:44.660 
gets an immediate reward and you can
keep<00:00:32.189> repeating<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:43.100> even<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.309> distance

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
keep repeating that even some distance

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.209 
keep repeating that even some distance
away<00:00:44.789> they'll<00:00:45.780> raise<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.710> lips<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
away they'll raise the lips in that

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.170 
away they'll raise the lips in that
Clemen<00:00:47.670> type<00:00:47.940> way<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:50.430> does<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
Clemen type way and what that does is it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.229 
Clemen type way and what that does is it
it<00:00:51.840> establishes<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.890> quite<00:00:53.160> playful<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it establishes it's quite playful but it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.119 
it establishes it's quite playful but it
also<00:00:54.390> establishes<00:00:54.660> an<00:00:55.260> idea<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.770> their<00:00:55.920> mind

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
also establishes an idea in their mind

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.849 
also establishes an idea in their mind
that<00:00:56.780> treats<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.050> reward

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.960 

so<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:03.199> we're<00:01:04.199> teaching<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.970> lift

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
their legs independently which is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.160 
their legs independently which is
preparation<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.700> Spanish<00:01:09.060> walk<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.630> PR<00:01:09.960> and

anyhow
moment<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.090> does<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:46.850> once<00:01:47.850> he<00:01:48.149> doesn't

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.370 

now<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.250> repeat<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:20.060> lot<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
now you have to repeat that a lot and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.120 
now you have to repeat that a lot and
then<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.670> same<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:24.410> each<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.950> then

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
then you do the same on each but then

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.790 
then you do the same on each but then
you<00:02:25.280> eventually<00:02:25.490> get<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:32.470> are<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.590> ready

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
you eventually get to this are you ready

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.070 
you eventually get to this are you ready
are<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.550> ready<00:02:34.580> 1<00:02:35.350> 1<00:02:36.350> 1<00:02:37.190> 1<00:02:37.790> see<00:02:38.540> I'm<00:02:38.630> not<00:02:38.810> even

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
are you ready 1 1 1 1 see I'm not even

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.940 
are you ready 1 1 1 1 see I'm not even
tapping<00:02:39.500> him<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.130> 2<00:02:44.440> by<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.500> way<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.710> first

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
tapping him and 2 by the way the first

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.740 
tapping him and 2 by the way the first
time<00:02:46.100> they<00:02:46.190> offered<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.940> say<00:02:47.120> big<00:02:47.420> step

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
time they offered that you say big step

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.570 
time they offered that you say big step
and<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:48.500> they<00:02:48.590> get<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.100> what<00:02:49.430> that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
and then they get to know what that

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:13.670 
and then they get to know what that
means

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.129 

okay<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.579> three<00:03:16.920> three<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.389> usually<00:03:19.389> find<00:03:20.019> that

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
okay so three three I usually find that

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.129 
okay so three three I usually find that
the<00:03:20.260> Front's<00:03:20.590> at<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.799> hawk<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.599> good<00:03:22.599> boy

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
the Front's at the hawk is good boy

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.069 
the Front's at the hawk is good boy
because<00:03:23.920> they<00:03:24.040> won't<00:03:24.219> kick<00:03:24.719> get<00:03:25.719> on<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> back

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
because they won't kick get on the back

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.809 
because they won't kick get on the back
of<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.319> hawk<00:03:26.469> they<00:03:26.620> sometimes<00:03:26.859> kick<00:03:27.280> out<00:03:27.459> but

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
of the hawk they sometimes kick out but

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.099 
of the hawk they sometimes kick out but
some<00:03:27.999> horse<00:03:28.209> is<00:03:28.299> preferred<00:03:28.659> on<00:03:28.840> them<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.079> you

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
some horse is preferred on them so you

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.959 
some horse is preferred on them so you
sometimes<00:03:29.349> have<00:03:29.499> to<00:03:29.620> feel<00:03:29.799> around<00:03:30.099> a<00:03:30.219> bit<00:03:30.400> but

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
sometimes have to feel around a bit but

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.699 
sometimes have to feel around a bit but
where<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.239> exact<00:03:31.510> spot<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.170> what<00:03:32.650> you

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
where the exact spot is and what you
