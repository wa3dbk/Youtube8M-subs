garden hose with power on a timer and

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.890 
garden hose with power on a timer and
that<00:00:35.470> would<00:00:35.620> be<00:00:35.740> enough<00:00:36.040> but<00:00:36.490> I<00:00:36.670> wanted<00:00:37.030> more

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
that would be enough but I wanted more

that would be enough but I wanted more
black<00:00:38.560> hose<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.640> black<00:00:39.880> hose<00:00:40.410> gathers<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
black hose the black hose gathers the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.680 
black hose the black hose gathers the
heat<00:00:41.710> from<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.980> Sun<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:43.150> what<00:00:43.270> I<00:00:43.300> did<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.660> I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
heat from the Sun so what I did is I

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.950 
heat from the Sun so what I did is I
bought<00:00:43.900> some<00:00:44.140> irrigation<00:00:45.180> tubing<00:00:46.180> which<00:00:46.780> is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
bought some irrigation tubing which is

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.380 
bought some irrigation tubing which is
also<00:00:47.230> black<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.850> there's<00:00:48.850> this<00:00:49.000> simple

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
also black and there's this simple

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.490 
also black and there's this simple
coupling<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.040> can<00:00:51.250> purchase<00:00:51.490> that<00:00:52.500> puts

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
coupling that you can purchase that puts

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.590 
coupling that you can purchase that puts
this<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:54.400> just<00:00:54.550> push<00:00:54.790> this<00:00:54.970> on<00:00:55.180> there<00:00:55.420> and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
this you just push this on there and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.210 
this you just push this on there and
then<00:00:55.720> now<00:00:55.840> you<00:00:55.900> can<00:00:55.990> screw<00:00:56.320> in<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.470> hose<00:00:56.650> so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
then now you can screw in a hose so

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.460 
then now you can screw in a hose so
that's<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.430> next<00:00:57.550> 100<00:00:58.000> feet<00:00:58.180> of<00:00:58.329> hose<00:00:59.230> right

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
that's the next 100 feet of hose right

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.380 
that's the next 100 feet of hose right
there<00:00:59.530> that<00:01:00.010> was<00:01:00.130> only<00:01:00.340> ten<00:01:00.820> bucks<00:01:01.030> for<00:01:01.270> that

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
there that was only ten bucks for that

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.960 
there that was only ten bucks for that
and<00:01:03.480> an<00:01:04.480> external<00:01:04.890> timer<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.220> will<00:01:06.280> go<00:01:06.670> on

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
and an external timer that will go on

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.810 
and an external timer that will go on
and<00:01:07.240> off<00:01:07.360> throughout<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.140> day<00:01:08.260> during<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
and off throughout the day during the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.040 
and off throughout the day during the
daylight<00:01:10.630> hours<00:01:10.690> right<00:01:11.470> here<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.900> was

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
daylight hours right here and that was

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.360 
daylight hours right here and that was
it<00:01:14.230> so<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.770> had<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.170> garden<00:01:17.170> hose<00:01:17.380> but<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.100> was

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
it so I had the garden hose but it was

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.910 
it so I had the garden hose but it was
probably<00:01:18.850> only<00:01:19.120> like<00:01:19.360> 25<00:01:20.290> dollars<00:01:20.500> at<00:01:20.830> the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
probably only like 25 dollars at the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.590 
probably only like 25 dollars at the
most<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.720> if<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.620> wanted<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.070> improve<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
most and if I wanted to improve the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.210 
most and if I wanted to improve the
solar<00:01:26.729> energy<00:01:27.729> heating<00:01:28.720> up<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.049> water<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.560> will

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
solar energy heating up the water I will

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
solar energy heating up the water I will
basically<00:01:31.140> put<00:01:32.140> either<00:01:32.350> more<00:01:32.740> black<00:01:33.729> tubing

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
basically put either more black tubing

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.930 
basically put either more black tubing
in<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.510> system<00:01:34.750> or<00:01:35.140> lay<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.280> black

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
in this system or lay it on black

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.820 
in this system or lay it on black
material<00:01:37.600> or<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.140> case<00:01:38.320> I'm<00:01:38.530> inside

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
material or in this case I'm inside

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.160 
material or in this case I'm inside
screened<00:01:39.280> light<00:01:40.090> putting<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.600> outside<00:01:40.720> would

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
screened light putting it outside would

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.420 
screened light putting it outside would
absorb<00:01:41.620> more<00:01:41.860> heat<00:01:41.920> or<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:44.350> could<00:01:44.799> encase<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.220> in

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
absorb more heat or I could encase it in

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
absorb more heat or I could encase it in
a<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:47.770> sort<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.010> plastic<00:01:48.640> or<00:01:48.790> glass<00:01:48.820> housing

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
a some sort of plastic or glass housing

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.890 
a some sort of plastic or glass housing
that's<00:01:50.049> painted<00:01:50.500> black<00:01:50.740> inside<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:52.180> like<00:01:52.299> a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
that's painted black inside just like a

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.130 
that's painted black inside just like a
greenhouse<00:01:53.440> effect<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.770> that's<00:01:56.860> it
