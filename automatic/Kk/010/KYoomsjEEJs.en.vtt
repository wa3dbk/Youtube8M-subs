00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.490
 I am this way of origin, not my mother tells me 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.540
 that when I was little I was also 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.980
 quite positive in things and everything 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.800
 but yes there are three things very 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.599
 important in life that is what 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.970
 explained here at the conference that is 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.340
 that first of all because it is oneself 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.849
 who wants to get out of that hole though 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.130
 you have fallen that you have forward as 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 be and you have to always look where 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.739
 there is light in that black hole and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.839
 pulling to in that direction and those 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.390
 other two points because they are very easy is 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.820
 that I have a great family that does not 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.500
 we call every day not much less 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.769
 my parents have given us a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.809
 perfect and fun education and the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.670
 third point are friends friends 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.460
 really not the ones that come out when 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.409
 I'm in the world championship or ni 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.800
 when I was at the Olympic Games and 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:03.980
 when not the friends of heart 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.920
 they exist and they are there and I have had 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.990
 very lucky and I have some friends 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.390
 brutal of a lifetime and that are like 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.119
 my illegal family not a little people already 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.820
 she can motivate herself but the great 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.130
 most need a motivation not me 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.219
 I think the one that is 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.079
 a part of the stimulation that you have 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.770
 to get there and I think that everything has 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.990
 one step and that if you have some help and 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.869
 good support because it is much better not 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.909
 but good if it comes from within that is 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.159
 perfect but good is so much percent 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.039
 very reduced 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.560
 yes yes total total and I think it 's that 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.380
 It is also the day to day that you have 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.240
 to fight for everything and to maintain 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.819
 things you have to fight every day and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.819
 keep them nobody gives nothing and less in 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.470
 these times not who was going to say that 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.679
 someone with a disability like the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.799
 I have I could get to run in 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.509
 cars that input and last year 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.170
 to be ninth in the world rally 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.569
 although who was going who was going to think about 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.849
 that's not this year, I'm going fourth 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.500
 capazo espaÃ±a absolute and first of my 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.380
 category who would not think then 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.329
 these things the first hallucinated also 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.459
 I am the one of what I do but I 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.760
 I think it's our day to day that's going 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.890
 motivating and that has ahead 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.470
 to see you have to look for alternatives but 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.290
 if they do not do sport one of the things 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.120
 that do a lot of motivation is to do 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.110
 sports to be better with one 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.150
 same then there they already have where of 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.879
 entry to be able to work and then 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.610
 solve the problems that you have not 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.319
 to make a circle point the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.819
 four things that I tell you but never 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.790
 it has done 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.060
 but you have to do it and that I sometimes 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.250
 I do the mental circumferences and the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.819
 things that are left over and things 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.500
 that give me problems and that I do not have 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.299
 solution must be solved and 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.480
 take them out that circle because they're 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.760
 giving a vice that does not subtract you 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.129
 the other work then things 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.150
 useless to get them out of the way and 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.150
 you will have fewer problems
