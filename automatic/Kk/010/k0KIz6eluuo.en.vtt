mobility<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.540> CR<00:01:12.900> series<00:01:13.409> practical<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
mobility is the CR series practical to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
mobility is the CR series practical to
take<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.000> definitely<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
take with you it definitely is as you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600 
take with you it definitely is as you
can<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.650> pretty<00:01:17.040> small<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.369> what

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
can see it's it's pretty small for what

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
can see it's it's pretty small for what
it<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> 14.1<00:01:18.930> inch<00:01:19.080> screen<00:01:19.500> size<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it is it's a 14.1 inch screen size so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
it is it's a 14.1 inch screen size so
it's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> widescreen<00:01:21.030> display<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it's a widescreen display so you can

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.539 
it's a widescreen display so you can
actually<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> screen<00:01:23.220> but

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
actually see a lot on the screen but

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
actually see a lot on the screen but
it's<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> only<00:01:23.850> 5.5<00:01:24.540> pounds<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.320> easy<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
it's the only 5.5 pounds so it's easy to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.109 
it's the only 5.5 pounds so it's easy to
carry<00:01:25.890> around<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.759> great<00:01:26.939> for

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
carry around and it's great for

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.600 
carry around and it's great for
portability<00:01:28.020> due<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> Intel's<00:01:28.829> Santa<00:01:29.460> Rosa

platform<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.180> well<00:01:30.329> too<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.470> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
platform as well too now what about this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
motion I camera up here can this be used

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
motion I camera up here can this be used
for<00:01:33.810> video<00:01:34.020> conferencing<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.159> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
for video conferencing it can it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010 
for video conferencing it can it
actually<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> built-in<00:01:36.090> microphone<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> a
