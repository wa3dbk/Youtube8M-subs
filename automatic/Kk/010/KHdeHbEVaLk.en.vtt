00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.880 
make this one two three four five six
seven<00:02:31.040> eight<00:02:31.400> nine<00:02:32.049> along<00:02:33.849> make<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:35.650> too<00:02:36.650> wide

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
seven eight nine along make it too wide

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.150 
seven eight nine along make it too wide
in<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.130> cellar<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.209> can<00:02:38.569> place<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.230> two

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
in the cellar so you can place the two

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.680 
in the cellar so you can place the two
streams<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.819> water<00:02:40.970> here<00:02:41.560> okay<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.489> then<00:02:43.760> do<00:02:44.510> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
streams of water here okay so then do it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.780 
streams of water here okay so then do it
the<00:02:44.870> same<00:02:45.079> this<00:02:45.290> side<00:02:47.079> okay<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:49.010> now<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.280> make

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
the same this side okay and now you make

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.699 
the same this side okay and now you make
the<00:02:50.060> neverfull<00:02:50.720> which<00:02:51.109> i'm<00:02:51.260> sure<00:02:51.290> most

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the neverfull which i'm sure most

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.120 
the neverfull which i'm sure most
players<00:02:52.010> know<00:02:52.340> how<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.579> build<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.560> you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
players know how to build that so you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.470 
players know how to build that so you
just<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.519> for<00:02:56.090> four<00:02:56.510> along<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.930> bottom<00:02:58.480> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
just do for four along the bottom and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.320 
just do for four along the bottom and
then<00:02:59.660> I<00:03:00.019> think<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.560> another<00:03:00.829> four<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:03.040> then

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.480 

okay<00:03:08.330> do<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.860> get<00:03:10.010> your<00:03:10.100> flint<00:03:10.400> and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
okay do that and you get your flint and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.680 
okay do that and you get your flint and
steel<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.410> right<00:03:13.100> click<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:14.300> bottom<00:03:14.569> of

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
steel and right click on the bottom of

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.130 
steel and right click on the bottom of
the<00:03:14.810> Obsidian<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.310> makes<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:17.140> you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
the Obsidian so it makes that for you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.229 
the Obsidian so it makes that for you
place<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.740> bucket<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.340> over<00:03:19.580> here<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.120> here

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
place a bucket of over here and here

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.740 
place a bucket of over here and here
look<00:03:23.239> slimes<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.959> there<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:26.330> then<00:03:26.510> your<00:03:26.660> place

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
look slimes in there and then your place

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.740 
look slimes in there and then your place
of<00:03:26.840> work<00:03:27.140> bench<00:03:27.470> right<00:03:28.220> here<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.520> don't<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.600> just

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
of work bench right here I don't it just

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.020 
of work bench right here I don't it just
gives<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.989> more<00:03:30.200> time<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.470> access<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.489> if<00:03:31.760> it's

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
gives you more time to access it if it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.180 
gives you more time to access it if it's
here<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.959> then<00:03:33.140> if<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.440> if<00:03:33.680> it's<00:03:33.890> right<00:03:34.040> there

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
here and then if it if it's right there

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.080 
here and then if it if it's right there
it<00:03:34.340> might<00:03:34.459> be<00:03:34.610> hard<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.880> access<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.160> then

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
it might be hard to access so and then

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.170 
it might be hard to access so and then
for<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.050> purpose<00:03:39.350> i'll<00:03:39.680> use<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.180> different

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
for this purpose i'll use a different
