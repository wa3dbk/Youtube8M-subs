is freakin awesome no way yeah so okay

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
is freakin awesome no way yeah so okay
so<00:01:13.970> look<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.150> beast<00:01:16.909> you're<00:01:17.909> actually

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
so look at this beast you're actually

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
so look at this beast you're actually
zips<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.439> from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> inside

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
zips from the from there from the inside

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.870 
zips from the from there from the inside
here<00:01:21.020> zips<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> way<00:01:22.710> around<00:01:22.830> another<00:01:23.759> way

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
here zips all the way around another way

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
here zips all the way around another way
so<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:27.060> obviously<00:01:27.150> no<00:01:27.509> chance<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so there's obviously no chance of the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.249 
so there's obviously no chance of the
rain<00:01:28.979> getting<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.970> opens<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:31.049> from

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
rain getting in so that opens up from

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.760 
rain getting in so that opens up from
there<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:33.049> this<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.710> just

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
