that you'll see in just a minute
and<00:00:16.660> what<00:00:17.440> we're<00:00:17.560> trying<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.770> do<00:00:17.980> is<00:00:18.300> maximize

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
and what we're trying to do is maximize

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.779 
and what we're trying to do is maximize
we<00:00:20.349> can<00:00:20.500> throw<00:00:20.650> up<00:00:20.859> at<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.070> seat<00:00:21.279> while

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
we can throw up at the seat while

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.939 
we can throw up at the seat while
minimizing<00:00:22.539> crop<00:00:23.109> injury<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.710> we're<00:00:23.830> doing

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
minimizing crop injury and we're doing

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.220 
minimizing crop injury and we're doing
that<00:00:24.189> by<00:00:24.460> using<00:00:24.640> these<00:00:24.990> stainless<00:00:25.990> steel

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
that by using these stainless steel

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.429 
that by using these stainless steel
fields<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.920> isolate<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.640> pulping<00:00:28.509> torch<00:00:28.810> heat

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
fields to isolate the pulping torch heat

source<00:00:30.000> from<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.060> crop<00:00:31.330> grows<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:32.280> I'll<00:00:33.280> do<00:00:33.460> a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
source from the crop grows so I'll do a

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.890 
source from the crop grows so I'll do a
demonstration<00:00:33.670> we'll<00:00:34.300> see<00:00:34.450> how<00:00:34.510> that<00:00:34.600> works

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
demonstration we'll see how that works

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.320

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
this whole unit left to right so this is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.520 
this whole unit left to right so this is
just<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.560> way<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:22.020> making<00:01:23.020> our<00:01:23.290> orientation

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
just a way of making our orientation

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.730 
just a way of making our orientation
field<00:01:23.979> as<00:01:24.100> precise<00:01:24.430> as<00:01:24.610> as<00:01:24.880> possible<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.200> we

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
field as precise as as possible so we

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.249 
field as precise as as possible so we
don't<00:01:27.490> have<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.670> worry<00:01:27.789> so<00:01:27.820> much<00:01:27.970> about<00:01:28.259> driver

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
don't have to worry so much about driver

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.169 
don't have to worry so much about driver
error<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.950> things<00:01:30.190> like<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.550> we<00:01:30.729> can<00:01:30.850> really

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
error and things like this we can really

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.570 
error and things like this we can really
maximize<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:33.039> space<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.399> we're

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
maximize the space that we're

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.930 
maximize the space that we're
effectively<00:01:33.910> controlling<00:01:34.420> weeds<00:01:34.570> over<00:01:35.940> here

so<00:01:59.709> why<00:01:59.830> don't<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.039> get<00:02:00.130> fired<00:02:00.429> up<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.050> we<00:02:02.050> can

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
so why don't I get fired up and we can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:03:35.530 
so why don't I get fired up and we can
kind<00:02:02.349> of<00:02:02.410> get<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> idea<00:02:03.459> what's<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.910> on<00:02:04.000> here

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.210 

go<00:03:36.540> through<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.780> field<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.260> put<00:03:37.410> our<00:03:37.530> profane

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
go through the field and put our profane

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.850 
go through the field and put our profane
treatment<00:03:38.580> on<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.500> pretty<00:03:40.500> much<00:03:40.590> immediately

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
treatment on and pretty much immediately

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.370 
treatment on and pretty much immediately
you<00:03:41.340> can<00:03:41.460> get<00:03:41.580> an<00:03:41.670> idea<00:03:41.900> whether<00:03:42.900> or<00:03:43.080> not<00:03:43.200> you

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
you can get an idea whether or not you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.220 
you can get an idea whether or not you
could<00:03:43.560> work<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.790> go<00:03:45.690> down<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
could work because if you go down and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.750 
could work because if you go down and
you<00:03:48.080> give<00:03:49.080> them<00:03:49.230> leave<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.680> squeeze<00:03:50.130> pull

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
you give them leave and I squeeze pull

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.910 
you give them leave and I squeeze pull
it<00:03:50.880> off<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:52.110> can<00:03:52.260> see<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.470> there's<00:03:52.830> a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
it off you can see that there's a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.670 
it off you can see that there's a
thumbprint<00:03:53.520> there<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.930> was<00:03:55.080> not<00:03:55.230> too<00:03:55.410> clear

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
thumbprint there that was not too clear

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.160 
thumbprint there that was not too clear
but<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.400> know<00:03:57.300> if<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.450> can<00:03:57.570> see<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.900> it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
but you know if you can see that it

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.440 
but you know if you can see that it
generally<00:03:58.470> means<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.770> you've<00:03:59.300> you've<00:04:00.300> gone

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
generally means that you've you've gone

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.910 
generally means that you've you've gone
over<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.080> generate<00:04:01.440> enough<00:04:01.620> heat<00:04:01.650> on

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
over it and you generate enough heat on

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.550 
over it and you generate enough heat on
that<00:04:01.980> leaf<00:04:02.370> surface<00:04:02.960> to<00:04:03.960> disrupt<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.380> cell

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
that leaf surface to disrupt the cell

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.580 
that leaf surface to disrupt the cell
membranes<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.660> cellular<00:04:06.960> contents<00:04:07.470> will

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
membranes and the cellular contents will

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.800 
membranes and the cellular contents will
start<00:04:07.800> leaking<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.460> the<00:04:09.420> weed<00:04:09.570> will<00:04:09.720> be

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
start leaking out and the weed will be

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.700 
start leaking out and the weed will be
pretty<00:04:10.470> much<00:04:10.560> killed<00:04:10.920> within<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.220> day<00:04:11.430> or<00:04:11.550> two
