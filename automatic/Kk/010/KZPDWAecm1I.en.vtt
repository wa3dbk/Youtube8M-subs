00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.400
 let's start 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.390
 your first name is paula pico yes 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.990
 in the brothers 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.500
 I'm not the only daughter in the conversion of 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.500
 Brothers 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:39.350
 you work in the police station 17 you work in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:39.350
 the police and direct 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.650
 it's a question like any other and 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.650
 corresponds to the question 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.260
 maybe in love with the dollar person and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.260
 two things 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.799
 confirmed sir the legal aspects 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.729
 what I do 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.729
 right I told you 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.600
 and when is the address 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.600
 according to the database 2012 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.200
 it's a waste and the worst of all of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.560
 how do you know please do not come 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.390
 now with 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.970
 It seems this woman says she has to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:56.189
 say something important to the polygon not 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:56.189
 we are going to lie 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 barbarian 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.569
 in the brigade in the bathroom we gave ourselves a 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.569
 kiss 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.530
 because I like it 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:30.080
 to see if the understanding 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:32.210
 and look that barbarian weight does not exist 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.370
 so lost actions 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.660
 one sometimes happens that some person lives 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.220
 in a very humble place and do not want 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 say where it is then it gives you 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.849
 any address 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.849
 and this is the case 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.020

 another day the operative so much interests you 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.870
 I do not see the situation well 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.860
 please to castle won 125 trials to 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.040
 almost impossible to search I know how to search 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.489
 traces we look for detectives 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.489
 is 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.780
 I would never have seen it 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:32.610
 and for that there is no reflection there is no patent 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.000
 back there is no perfect reflection there is no 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.910
 patent but look here the crystals makes 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.300
 zoom 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:46.460
 how many times did I spend 25 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.830
 when they make you record the crystals that 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.180
 they put the patent died for 1945 great 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.130
 there is no project get there 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.120
 cool the patent look at who was 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.270
 patent finalizes a child well write 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.270
 forever 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.510
 to this end 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.200
 Alberto was up 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.610
 we are here side 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.610
 it's in maria de mendoza 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.350
 and what does a martina variety have to do? 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.780
 as you would see the polygon is obviously 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.620
 the nexus between the two things because this 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.620
 team have it 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.699
 is fugitive step 200 far on the border 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.419
 for 200 fans 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.009
 medel book levels or martina the judge what 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.950
 freed until the trial so you will not see 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:46.240
 never message of course 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.240
 you know when that happens 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.090
 when a person marries others without 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.530
 know her really 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.420
 because it's for me because it 's personal 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.420
 because to my heart we are talking 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.180
 polygraph but that is so broken not 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.130
 it works please you will be guided by 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.410
 that considers him a man more 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.060
 smart look i had to prove myself 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.740
 if polygraph is my best friend it's a lot 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.190
 younger than what you say going better than 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.190
 what you 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.600
 let's do things right once and for all 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.340
 by all so that there is no doubt 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.870
 at least watched and that you can 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.310
 stay calm that I 'm not 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.070
 lying asking the question you want 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.620
 well we had the pin protocol blaming 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.620
 let's see everything, yes 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.800
 it seems a long time that you are not with 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.000
 barbara or whatever you want to say you're 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.890
 you're asking if it's been a long time 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.310
 time I do not have sex 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.200
 with barbara that is the answer is yes 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.580

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.409
 relations with barbara yes yes you are 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.419
 in love with barberà 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.160
 If I'm in love with Barberà 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.440
 answer is no no 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.330
 everything you told me with respect 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.210
 what you felt 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.110
 truly 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.110
 yes 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:26.070
 because they come to shit 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.070
 I say Laura Paula 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:47.190

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:54.320

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:54.320
