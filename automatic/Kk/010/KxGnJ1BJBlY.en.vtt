00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi one and seemed nice to some 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 create nail art tutorials and today 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.990
 I have four of you in one video 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.509
 they are really very easy tutorial 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.830
 she is basically anyone can do it and 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.630
 you don't need that much 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 the only tools you need i can 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.480
 just buy where your essence is just 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 with spice barrel so it doesn't take much time 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
 it doesn't take much effort either 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.480
 the effect is very cool the first 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.060
 nail art tutorials actually not really 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 To call it nail art it is actually one 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.570
 layer of white nail polish with over it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.829
 a top coat nail polish that I use is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 essence de jill 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.760
 gelpolish and this color is 33 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.010
 while to my place it is very good 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.660
 and he actually covers it unfortunately 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 two layers are really beautiful 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.570
 covering layer and over it I do 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.360
 this top coat from l'orÃ©al 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.800
 with a kind of yes gold shirts it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 kind of really kind of like you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 a kind of gold leaf effects and know 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.580
 in combination with gold I just think 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.930
 very very summery, very luxurious 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340
 and it's just a very beautiful one 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 combination 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.770
 so yes actually two layers of this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.290
 top coat and this top pro that is called 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.049
 by the way, goldleaf and they had coral 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 beach collection of loriaux two layers 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.350
 of these simply over a covering layer 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.049
 white and actually one I really find one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
 top combination very easy and therefore 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.530
 not really a whole article but it still came 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 briefly show haley and the second 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.590
 nail art tutorials my own 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.759
 favorite I really like him 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.950
 cute 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.070
 you grab an eden dog dash a white one 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.079
 nail polish from essence and you paint it 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 basically all your nails except in 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.759
 middle finger nail that varnish into one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.540
 I have chosen pastel color 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.030
 this mint green color also 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 And it's in this color that is called play how I do 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.680
 marmite 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.860
 but what you need next is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.050
 this striper and that is in this fun 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.750
 yes that is the plastic folder with still 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.940
 carpet of essence sponges and it is the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 nail art designer at 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.240
 and this striper you can just do 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.290
 Use with any color nail polish you 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.630
 but want 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.730
 So what I'm going to do is this striper 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.590
 close by in the white nail polish and with this 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.720
 I draw dashes 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.510
 You can actually go over and over the mint color 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.260
 after that I pick up this nail art sticker 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.640
 those are also of essence and yes i found 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.190
 it's nice to just grab bows 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.590
 for a middle finger nail and that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.200
 other nice alleys that I just grab 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.200
 for my cock and for my index finger 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.209
 nail to glam still a bit 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.239
 give accent to the entire nail art 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.190
 look but a fingernail that I have 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.709
 actually just painted white first 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.800
 and apply two layers of it 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.120
 yes a silver top coat to 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.840
 just what fun to be with for a base and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.340
 sparco accent to just a silver 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 have glitter nail polish on the one 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.180
 hail and for that I have this varnish gesture 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.260
 from leicester 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.390
 that's just a friend of mine 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
 its own after we do it for a while 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.410
 no longer with this hot but tasty 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.269
 dot com you can find all my nail polishes and 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.470
 the third nail art tutorial that is real 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.720
 super colorful 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.450
 what i always like when you are nature 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.040
 is going to work is to with a white base 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.580
 so I work all my nails for a long time 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.040
 once again nail polish with this wildlife 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.260
 of essence so that the colors and enough 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.760
 stand out more 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.680
 you can take any color that you like 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.269
 I want three very fierce ones 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.549
 colors namely a bright pink 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.870
 nail polish from leicester this hot pink 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.560
 kennel magpie i have here 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.330
 very bright almost yes Netherlands could 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.299
 call it really a very bright green 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.569
 color also from external is hot 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.450
 dispute neon green starts and then I have 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.209
 here a bright purple nail polish 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.250
 chanel and this entire country of the 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.349
 so in total i just have three fierce ones 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.959
 packed colors but you can do any color 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.810
 combination just grab what you have at home 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.180
 then I grab this striper tool again 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.010
 from essence in I baptize in the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.049
 different paint colors and I go 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.640
 just nice again 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.220
 make lines over my nails 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.780
 not in a certain order I have to be there 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.220
 not too much to think about it too needs 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.199
 not super neat it may be pretty 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.329
 being messy that causes one 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.220
 very nice and playful effect to it 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.889
 It is finally important that you do it for a while 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.139
 for any jacket 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.460
 say how long your nails or on your fingers 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.440
 but my actually a face like you 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.850
 that briefly cleans with a 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.260
 cotton bud 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.669
 and then you just have a really nice one 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.889
 colorful 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.530
 nail art and very easy to wake up 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.840
 fourth nail art tutorial which is what 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.520
 tighter and a bit more minimalistic 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.960
 and also very nice for the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.690
 summer because that more 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.510
 so I use a white base 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.849
 here the essence lab on all my nails and 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.370
 then I use a black lacquer 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.900
 this is a lock of sally hansen it is 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.520
 the miracle stylo because I just too 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.349
 use another black nail polish 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.729
 for this you need a bit of a 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.220
 have a firm hand 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.660
 so armi paper and striper tool 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.840
 naturally important is that you 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.190
 just draw a very small line 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.770
 really try your hand 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.630
 straight and not too hard 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.570
 so just zero tricks succeed 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.560
 that you just fine black line 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.560
 get over it 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.820
 through your nail just fun and 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.320
 nevertheless does not necessarily you may also like 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.080
 but i did kind of like it 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.889
 of herbs cross type of in te 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.139
 to make 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.210
 so what i do is another line too 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.490
 crazy crazy but only at the end of it 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.160
 your nail so it doesn't necessarily hurt you whole 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.620
 striking cross and by doing this 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.180
 seem to nail your list to something 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.070
 longer than if you put the cross on my it 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.690
 middle so does to you what the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.310
 end of your nail 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.130
 as a very cool and minimalist 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.960
 effect and we do that with the basics 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.940
 simply sit still fresh from you 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.169
 also just a really nice nail art for 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.210
 the summer 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.310
 these were the four nail art tutorial 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.680
 piece and I wanted to show it 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.479
 they are very easy to make me 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.380
 I find it an advantage because I think 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.180
 it nice to 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.919
 yes press your nail polish and nice the nails too 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.780
 but I don't necessarily need that 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.520
 being busy for hours or so am happy 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.630
 that this is just very simple nail art 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.280
 are tutorials 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.340
 anyone can just make the only thing 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.570
 what you need is a striper and 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.940
 possibly 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.250
 stickers but yes you can just in 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.950
 buy the essence shelf at seasoning 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.780
 so also order elsewhere via Kruis.nl 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.570
 if you do not meet community was because I 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.039
 know that not everyone has finished so yes 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.900
 it's just very easy to make and 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.180
 also not cost a lot of money 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.840
 I am not sponsored by 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.010
