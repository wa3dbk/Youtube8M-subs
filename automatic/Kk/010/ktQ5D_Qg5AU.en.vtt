00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.619
music

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.085
Hello! We are in the kitchen, it's time to distract and soothe yourself with something delicious.

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:17.715
and today’s video is for those who love all sorts of candy,
butterscotch, caramel.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.515
And that’s why, we will prepare caramel with you.

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.765
Most likely, they will be such as candies.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:26.872
Today we will use, again, a microwave, and it will be a quick and easy recipe.

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:28.872
Let me show you what you will need today.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.765
For today's caramel we will take all the sweetest and fat.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:36.765
Firstly, it's sugar, about 200 grams of white sugar, but for caramel

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:40.188
brown sugar is commonly used.

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.958
Half of brown sugar and half of white.

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.858
But I know, more than half of you will ask later,

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.218
is it possible to use just a white sugar,

00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:50.878
so today I will try to use only refined white sugar.

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:54.888
Also, we need 120 grams of maple syrup 
or corn syrup.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.888
But I'm in a small town right now and to find maple syrup here is

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:02.308
like, I don't know, like to find the uranium ore.

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:04.098
You won’t find it even with the light during the day!

00:01:04.098 --> 00:01:06.218
I think, Uranium ore here you will find faster

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:08.528
So I'll use honey.

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:12.878
The only disadvantage of honey - it is not very good to heat,
and it is prone to crystallization.

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:16.268
The best variant - corn syrup.

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:18.314
Because it doesn't crystallize with sugar.

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:22.314
If you will find corn syrup, use it or maple syrup.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:25.825
Also, I'll take butter. We'll need 120 grams.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:29.825
And 120ml of condensed milk. 
According to GOST, in short.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:33.825
And another ingredient, which, again, I don't have.
It's vanilla, vanilla extract.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:40.495
If you have a liquid vanilla extract, take half a teaspoon /a teaspoon.

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:44.495
In General, in the description under the video(infobox)
I will write all the ingredients, so read this information.

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:47.455
Let's start cooking!

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:52.555
Firstly, we need to take 120g of butter and melt it.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:02:02.295
For this I will use the microwave, I’ll put my butter there for 30 seconds and I let it melt.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.600
So butter has melted, and now add all the main ingredients.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:17.342
I have this sugar, honey
(we need, of course, a big bowl, I'll pour into a large bowl)

00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:25.637
Now people will know how candy are cooked, 
and they're like, “I'm not gonna eat it anymore, it's too fat!”

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:31.085
Measure condensed milk
(I have it unusually thick, because it’s just from the fridge)

00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:38.451
Add our condensed milk.

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:42.751
And it should be mixed thoroughly.

00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:49.498
It will be good, if you’ll take a large bowl. Our caramel needs more space, but I'll try to heat in this one.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:56.231
And now there's a difficult technological process, because we have to put it into the microwave:)

00:02:56.231 --> 00:03:01.771
In the description under the video I will try to leave all the details: at what power, how many minutes you need to heat this thing.

00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:05.771
Because all microwaves are different, I will try to write for different powers.

00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:11.611
Now I will put it at power of 800 watts for 4 minutes.

00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:15.623
I will Heat my caramel, then I will pull out, I will mix and I will look.

00:03:19.452 --> 00:03:27.622
I have waited 3.5 minutes, and my caramel tries to splash out of my Cup, so the Cup should be larger.

00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:34.632
Now, I pour the caramel into the larger bowl and put it into the microwave at 800 watts for 9 minutes.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:42.086
But every minute or two, I take it out and mix, for being sure that nothing is burned and well distributed and heated.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:49.992
Finally, I heated this thing in the microwave 9 minutes.

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:53.992
Look, it has become caramel!

00:03:53.992 --> 00:03:57.992
Here is the difficulty: the longer you heat it – the more chewy it will be.

00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:01.992
If you want creamy, soft caramels, you need to heat it less.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:04.592
in the description under the video everything will be described

00:04:04.592 --> 00:04:08.592
Now we need to pour it somewhere, in some form where it will cool down.

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:15.212
I will take this glass form, it is large, so the layer will be thin, but it's okay.

00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:19.062
We need to take some form and grease it with butter.

00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:21.732
And now, we will pour there our hot caramel.

00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:26.662
And by the way, if you have vanilla extract, it's time to add it to the hot caramel.

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:34.692
So I grease it with thin layer of oil, then our caramel can be removed and cut into pieces, after cooling down.

00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:41.325
Make a thin layer…

00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:45.325
The hardest part is to wash the dishes after all this:)

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:51.089
Now it's simple: you need to leave the caramel, so it cools down (it will probably take a few hours)

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:55.089
It will become elastic, and it will be possible to get it out and cut into candies.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:58.979
It will freeze and I will tell you how much time has passed.

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:06.089
My Friends! I took the caramel out of the refrigerator, it has cooled to room temperature, it has took about an hour and a half.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:10.473
Look! Absolutely, absolutely frozed!

00:05:11.063 --> 00:05:16.503
Look at this, our caramel is soft.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:24.497
I just added a little bit of salt here, because caramel is often prepared with sea salt and I wanted to try

00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:27.437
what is salted sweet caramel.

00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:31.437
Now we need to remove it carefully and can cut.

00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:36.677
I have quite soft, it was possible to fry a little more.

00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:39.184
Salted caramel!

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:50.824
And, in principle, it can be cut into pieces and served with tea.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.199
I laid out my caramel for the photo with such buttons on the plate.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.199
What can I say? Definitely, it should have kept longer in the fridge,

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.199
or baked in the microwave a little longer, so it would be more chewy.

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.199
Very Soft caramel, but extremely tasty.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:20.019
And what I can say, it’s perfect if you like McDonald's ice-cream with caramel topping, here is the perfect variant

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:24.019
to pour hot caramel over ice cream.

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:26.879
Super topping!

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.879
And I will try, I have them, however, very liquid, I will eat with a fork.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:36.866
I got the one with salt. You know, it's a very interesting variant.

00:06:36.866 --> 00:06:40.866
On the contrast, I think it’s a great variant, so if you will make the caramel a little part

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:43.696
Sprinkle it with salt. What if you like it too?

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:47.696
This is where I finish my video, really, try to cook this tasty thing.

00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:50.686
Take a picture and poste to Instagram with the hashtag
#KuhnyaShow

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:53.986
And also be sure to subscribe to the public Vkontakte, which is called "Kuhnya"(Kitchen)

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.706
Bon appetite for me and you!

00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:56.656
I'll see you soon in the kitchen.

00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:05.811
I don't have enough ice cream. Caramel and salt!
