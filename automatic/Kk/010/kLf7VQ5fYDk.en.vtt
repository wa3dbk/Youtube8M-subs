that<00:00:13.769> bill<00:00:14.099> isn't<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.969> deadly<00:00:15.450> accurate

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that bill isn't just a deadly accurate

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.650 
that bill isn't just a deadly accurate
way<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> fish<00:00:16.550> once<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.789> stork<00:00:18.090> catches<00:00:18.539> the
