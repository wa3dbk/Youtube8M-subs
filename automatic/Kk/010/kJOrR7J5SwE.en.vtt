00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 border the question of the last word then 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.049
 What is it about 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.589
 very frequently at the end of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.650
 test 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.000
 the jury raises an ultimate and last 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 question the next question what is 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.730
 what you want to add what is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.160
 your last word while she's a 107 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.359
 questions related to this question she 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.449
 invite you to come back by yourself 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.230
 it is you who makes the choice on such 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.930
 or such argument but in general the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.969
 candidate's motivation 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
 saying why he chose to be 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.020
 nurses what is not necessary 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 do it most importantly do not answer to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.070
 these two questions by saying well 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 listen 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.520
 I hope I have convinced you not 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.710
 here there is not hope or 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.100
 of hope you have chosen this profession 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 you have translated your motivations 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.590
 wanted to integrate such qualified the same 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.330
 this attitude which consists in saying in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.290
 answering listen well look no further 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.659
 I'm done I'm done to affirm 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.700
 choose me it's very cavalier it's 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.799
 very reckless I happened many times 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.820
 and many times to have in front of me 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.140
 candidates who by this pirouette 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 desired is not it depressed the nail in 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.150
 saying no more was it's me well 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.950
 obviously this did not happen to me 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.189
 convince and that's the kind of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 conclusion that does not allow a candidate 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.500
 to score points of the month for this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.570
 question then the question of the last 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.220
 word I could simply art 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.950
 wait for the re translate by two we have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.780
 follows namely well say 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.549
 we one last time but with 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 different words 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.189
 why are you here why would 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.229
 to become a nurse 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.409
 what are the means put in place 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.719
 to achieve this goal and in 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.520
 some cases attention the jury poses 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.500
 a third question a question 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.080
 which is very classic and if you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.680
 fail what could you 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.740
 and well the candidate answers I will iron 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.410
 yes very well we understood but 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.190
 you play there twice twice three 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.460
 times four times or you indicate that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 you have a second anchovy craft 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.350
 second be it happened to me many times and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.790
 many times in my career of 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.320
 answered candidates listen I 'm leaving you there 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.120
 go quickly and in belgium since there 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.210
 the contest and well get organized 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.480
 differently we can matter if you 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.950
 would like to go and choose to live in 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.340
 side of the mac and peace on the side of 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.290
 Brussels 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.670
 this is not the problem in all 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.980
 case we must not let go 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.290
 you have to show that it's your choice 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.230
 that you did not wish in any case in 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.970
 derogate that it's your will and that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.970
