00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and the legislation we've seen so far

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.400 
and the legislation we've seen so far
does<00:02:29.489> both<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.390> I'd<00:02:30.510> say<00:02:30.750> we're<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> were<00:02:31.350> a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
does both so I'd say we're if it were a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.630 
does both so I'd say we're if it were a
baseball<00:02:31.830> game<00:02:32.010> we're<00:02:32.220> kind<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
baseball game we're kind of at the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.130 
baseball game we're kind of at the
bottom<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> first<00:02:33.330> inning<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.900> need<00:02:34.050> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
bottom of the first inning we need to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.420 
bottom of the first inning we need to
keep<00:02:34.290> working<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.860> try<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.160> focus<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:36.000> cost

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
keep working and try to focus on cost

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.380
