00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
light on African Americans so I really

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830

who will admittingly

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.190 
who will admittingly
say<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.820> use<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.570> word<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:56.510> when<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.540> use<00:02:57.930> that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200

say I use that word and when I use that
word<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.830> don't<00:02:59.310> find<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.970> offensive

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
word I don't find that it's offensive

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.650 
word I don't find that it's offensive
because<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:01.140> whatever<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:02.120> when<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.360> used

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
because of whatever it's when it's used

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.050 
because of whatever it's when it's used
possibly<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.590> context<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.459> used<00:03:05.730> when

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
possibly the context that is used when

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.630 
possibly the context that is used when
you<00:03:06.269> choose<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.569> use<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.350> mean<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.830> think<00:03:07.980> that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
you choose to use it I mean I think that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.000 
you choose to use it I mean I think that
why<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.150> say<00:03:09.510> it's<00:03:09.870> important<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.739> debate

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
why I say it's important for the debate

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.640 
why I say it's important for the debate
discussion<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.850> because<00:03:12.269> we<00:03:12.720> get<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.050> have<00:03:13.080> an

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
discussion is because we get to have an

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
almost positive I probably used that

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.660 
almost positive I probably used that
