00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
hands and let your fingers do the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
hands and let your fingers do the
walk-in<00:01:26.429> so<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.179> gonna<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.539> all<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
walk-in so we're gonna do that all the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.339 
walk-in so we're gonna do that all the
way<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> top<00:01:28.759> cross<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.119> pull<00:01:30.349> across

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
way up to the top cross and pull across

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:39.260 
way up to the top cross and pull across
in<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:31.740> foil

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 

so<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> always<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so if you always in there you do this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.190 
so if you always in there you do this
theme<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> end<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.869> did<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
theme on the end that we did on the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
theme on the end that we did on the
first<00:01:43.439> side<00:01:43.680> where<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> pinch<00:01:44.340> off<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.850> an

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
first side where you pinch off about an

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.139 
first side where you pinch off about an
inch<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.619> twist<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.729> again<00:01:48.000> I'm

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
inch and twist it and I like again I'm

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.999 
inch and twist it and I like again I'm
going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:48.930> send<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

make our hook grab onto one end and
we're<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.789> curve<00:02:03.179> it<00:02:03.330> down<00:02:04.369> bring<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.429> in
