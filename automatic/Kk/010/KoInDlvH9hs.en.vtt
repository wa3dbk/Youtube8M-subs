00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone today let's talk a little 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.839
 of the game 3 stickers them right now no 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.460
 it's my favorite but almost and maybe 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.800
 in the not too distant future become 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 in me as a favorite what yes it is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 sure is that I put it with my super 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.500
 favorites game 3 we have here the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.410
 sensor aurora el wajay yushu long el mou 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.330
 huan ying and the yang panchín I put it with 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.340
 my super favorites is a cube that is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.599
 adapts very well to my technique is easy to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.730
 control you do not have to do much 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.289
 force when you turn it 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.840
 if you do too much strength it can be 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.220
 clog a little even you can like 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.260
 deform 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.060
 it has a very easy turn with little force 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.060
 let's make a couple of algorithms 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.210
 it goes perfectly it 's a wonder 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.760
 I am very happy with these tubes the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.510
 true 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.990
 let's do a permutation of these 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.700
 you see that quite loud too 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.830
 let's leave it as it was 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.840
 and we are going to see a little bit the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.340
 inside the cube and here we have a couple 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 of edges in the part of the right one 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.580
 edge of the guns 3 and in the part of the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.620
 left a list of the dalián sanchis 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 since I have a widening sticker leds 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.580
 Well, let's compare the pieces, not if 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.980
 we put them like that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.510
 you see that the edge of the profit is a lot 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.550
 more straight while that of sant if 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.370
 has the typical curvature this outgoing 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.700
 and then curl around here if the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.530
 we put like this you see that the base of the sun if 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.260
 This whole area is much longer than in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.230
 the game and here we can see 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.820
 because the typical torpedo does not crack me 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.790
 Sanchis, I have the torpedoes on 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.560
 which is an optional accessory 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.370
 and here you see how we also have a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.290
 kind of torpedo in the guns 3 we're going to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.970
 see the corners in the part of the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 left we have a corner of Dalian 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 sanchis and as you can see the typical design of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.760
 diane sanchis not a corner that ends 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.830
 here and then it has a long base and 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
 rounded we have then all these 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.390
 strange curvatures over here not a 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 very interesting design while the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.700
 corner of the guns you see that it is much more 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 straight not a straight design we have the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.179
 corner that extends directly 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.710
 to the base and then you see that it is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.150
 completely hollow does not have these here 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.920
 holes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.460
 to allow the cutting of corners and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.410
 all these things 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 Well, you see, there are two designs 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.000
 quite different but two designs very 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.370
 good and how cahan the pieces then in 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.140
 the year of sanchis fit as you see 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.520
 we have this outgoing edge that 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.500
 fits in the curvature of the corner 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.120
 then we have a hollow area and then 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.940
 we have the base of the corner that remains 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.580
 trapped 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.700
 on the edge with the torpedo 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.770
 and in game 3 we have one more contact 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.780
 intimate let's see it 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:51.310
 we have still here we have this 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 that the entire surface is in contact 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.050
 and you see how the base of the corner that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.670
 was completely caught on the edge 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.890
 there's no way that the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.270
 piece is not that in game 3 the pop is 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.730
 very difficult while in the allianz 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.280
 and see the pop passes then from time to time 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.560
 when anyway the most striking 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.130
 of the guns 3 is its revolutionary design 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.690
 the core does not need screws anymore 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.220
 you know that in cubes whenever 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.319
 put screws tighten the tensions 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.220
 well here we do not have screws we have 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.160
 a structure you see here the core 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.260
 no screws the arms go anchored 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.990
 directly to the core and then we put 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.410
 here a nut the dock but we do not use 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.010
 screws is a different design a 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.270
 original design and a very good design and 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.240
 by the way here I have the first version 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.830
 of the great stress I had blue gradient 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.750
 that is very good but good is 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.310
 impossible to resolve it quickly because no 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.400
 we can recognize these colors in little 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.269
 not time but but it turns very well 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.799
 the great stress does not really pop is 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.299
 extremely unlikely to make pop man 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.599
 it could happen it's clear but it 's very 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.610
 difficult just happens to you once every 500 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.590
 sometimes not that you solve it either 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.689
 It blocks a lot of man can be blocked 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.579
 if you do too much force as I said 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.500
 before because you can form a little 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.879
 the cube can get stuck if 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.409
 you were too much a corner cut is 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.209
 Well, like all cubes, but not 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.590
 in general if you master it well and you 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.789
 you usually do not have to block 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.989
 and the corner cut is also very 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.820
 good although I have this version 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.160
 a little tighter these are my 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.090
 tensions 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.070
 so you can see an idea 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.070
 but can reach 45 degrees 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:37.159
 although I have it a little less you see 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.919
 a little less than 45 degrees but almost 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.019
 and two thirds in reverse 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.629
 not without problems without problem and in 

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:46.159
 small quantities is cuts of 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.369
 ridiculous corners is small 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.929
 amounts is that he does not know and how 

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.939
 I commented before you see the design of the 

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:54.799
 Hollow corners everything is designed to 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.229
 that cutting corners so that the 

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:59.479
 general operation of the bucket be 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.179
 perfect whatever it is I'm very happy 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.379
 with this cube and since I have here where 

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:05.599
 have sanchis stickers we are going to make them 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.789
 a small comparison calls us a lot 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.229
 attention the issue of holes in 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.360
 the widening were already quite large 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.560
 but the Ghanaian 3 are much bigger 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.870
 Fixed are very large holes 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.900
 then the size 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.820
 let's see if we can see the Ghanaian 3 is 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.860
 a little bit smaller than yang's 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.210
 sanchis but it shows the difference if 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.100
 you are used to legend sanchis what are you going 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.380
 to notice a little bit more and more 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.720
 light is also true 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.030
 the white is equal the two cubes the red 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.990
 a little bit more intense in game 3 the 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.970
 yellow 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.560
 also in the sancho is a little bit more 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.690
 off the yellow I like the damage more 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.080
 sans and I like the orange of 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.639
 sant and this one nothing is a little weird 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.550
 the green is also a little more intense 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.259
 in gas 3 and blue also but good 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.540
 the colors are well recognized and we are not going 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.400
 to have problems 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.020
 let's make a contrast pattern 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.740
 you see that there is no problem 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.740
 they recognize the colors well 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.070
 It is a combo that I recommend without a doubt 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.810
 some are lately taking the 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.430
 very good games market that already 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.170
 we all know this is a market that 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.910
 is practically saturated are not all 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.190
 the cubes are very good but I'm what 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.919
 I notice at least it is what to me 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.150
 it seems a little better although they are all 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.790
 very good but not a little better 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.340
 then I recommend it without a doubt 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.860
 some I think is a game that can 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.050
 like a lot of people 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.360
 and with which we can obviously improve 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.129
 our times for sure here I am 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.629
 dismissal with great stress with the great 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.129
 stress makes a gradient since the 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.469
 we have around here with the widening damage 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:38.969
 with a bow whale although I had here 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:43.169
 a sensor or aurora cover lampáns and a 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:46.590
 white game today a chulón and a mod 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.129
 wang jing and with the cube fish obviously 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.780
 the most important of all because 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.550
 summarizing is a common and I recommend it 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.650
 I certainly hope that I have 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.759
 liked the video as always and we 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.759
 we see in another a greeting to all
