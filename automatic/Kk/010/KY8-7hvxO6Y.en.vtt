00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.570
 we're going to talk about it today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.830
 to consider 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.269
 yes these learning materials where learning 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 of vekabest and if you are on the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.110
 the link below will come to the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.519
 webshop and then you can also possibly 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 order books or 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.970
 order package so check that my 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.970
 iphone se webshop 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.769
 I can do one of those 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.260
 tell some things 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.630
 of course you have to handle trees and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.940
 without level trees 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 This is for example as you see on it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.010
 board a transition 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 you can wear a shirt with level crossing trees 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.670
 it becomes a kind then you have for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.340
 so that is a protected level crossing 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 also below you can see a sign with 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 those three stripes means you are 240 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.309
 meters away from the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.170
 get along 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.170
 so each line represents 80 meters 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.360
 sofa you've crossings but 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 if this sign is on, it means that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.740
 you have no level crossing or tunnel that 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.950
 is not secured 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 there are often alarm bells and red ones 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.430
 flashing lights 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.869
 make sure you always go on naturally 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.570
 time can still brake if to cut 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.020
 the lights go on and the alarm bells go 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.420
 ringing 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.909
 so approach him calmly if you don't have any 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.770
 trees crossing the indication I 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 it just sends all had equally across 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.229
 important that you also see that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.710
 you are 80 meters away or 160 or 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.380
 240 meters away and from rail 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.770
 so think about it well we can 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 other first choice so call it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.799
 Expect that its also for one or that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.640
 stand by the track fruit like 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.640
 for example here 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.420
 that means a trail or a double 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.950
 track there is important because the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.899
 country may be the two sides off 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.299
 come 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.670
 also always think that you are the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.709
 consultation is always a track of course 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.980
 keep free 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.000
 after you neatly continued to handle trees 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.620
 stands still or even on this picture 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.670
 so make sure you get to the intersection 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.260
 of course always pretty late important to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.489
 to know 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.590
 groping treetops is also opening 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.550
 that you understand of course have to wait 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.230
 until the red light goes out bad 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.640
 important because as long as it flashes and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.830
 you can always walk the trees 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.870
 expect a train after containment 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.230
 of course also always the engine off 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.080
 the moment you go for one 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.680
 there is a lot about real still 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.970
 good luck 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.010
 that was just a short story about 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.890
