00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:07.740 

it's<00:02:57.340> candy<00:02:57.989> but<00:02:58.989> it<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:01.330> there's<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.780> lot<00:03:06.750> like

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
it's candy but it if there's a lot like

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.300 
it's candy but it if there's a lot like
that<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.980> prefer<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.430> use<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:11.100> double<00:03:12.100> sided

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
that so I prefer to use a double sided

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.780 
that so I prefer to use a double sided
tape<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.989> can<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.320> some<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.920> head<00:03:15.700> of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
tape you can get some like head of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.490 
tape you can get some like head of
crafts<00:03:16.239> those<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.770> just<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.100> put<00:03:18.430> them<00:03:18.610> down

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
crafts those and just like put them down

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.830 
crafts those and just like put them down
or<00:03:20.500> can<00:03:20.830> use<00:03:20.980> those<00:03:21.130> non<00:03:21.400> studies<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:24.690> does<00:03:25.690> it

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
or can use those non studies so does it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.800 
or can use those non studies so does it
probably<00:03:26.200> work<00:03:26.320> better<00:03:27.390> because<00:03:28.390> those<00:03:28.660> are

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
probably work better because those are

00:03:28.810 --> 00:04:04.320 
probably work better because those are
actually<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.530> fingerboarding

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:19.750 

so<00:04:05.330> yeah<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:08.620> hmm<00:04:09.620> what<00:04:09.980> else<00:04:10.010> will<00:04:18.760> there's

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
so yeah and hmm what else will there's

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.470 
so yeah and hmm what else will there's
nothing<00:04:20.060> really<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.480> also<00:04:20.720> say<00:04:21.049> about<00:04:21.260> it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:09.040 

about<00:05:58.389> my<00:05:58.719> hands<00:05:59.589> length<00:06:00.839> and

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.540 

it's<00:06:10.050> this<00:06:10.350> much<00:06:10.560> wider<00:06:10.860> than<00:06:11.040> the<00:06:11.160> technique

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
it's this much wider than the technique

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.220 
it's this much wider than the technique
and<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:14.150> holes<00:06:15.150> are<00:06:15.330> drilled<00:06:15.480> in<00:06:15.720> perfectly

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
and the holes are drilled in perfectly

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.170 
and the holes are drilled in perfectly
so<00:06:16.620> if<00:06:16.920> you<00:06:17.160> don't<00:06:17.420> I<00:06:18.860> mean<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.670> hole<00:06:20.820> drilled

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
so if you don't I mean the hole drilled

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.770 
so if you don't I mean the hole drilled
in<00:06:21.270> perfectly<00:06:21.750> so<00:06:22.080> here<00:06:22.530> there<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.730> no<00:06:24.360> problem

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
in perfectly so here there is no problem

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.200 
in perfectly so here there is no problem
putting<00:06:25.020> in<00:06:25.290> the<00:06:25.500> trucks<00:06:27.860> yeah<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.310> there's

putting in the trucks yeah and there's
one<00:06:30.510> centimeter<00:06:31.110> there's<00:06:31.920> a<00:06:32.010> once<00:06:32.190> I'm<00:06:32.370> can<00:06:32.550> we

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
one centimeter there's a once I'm can we

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.320 
one centimeter there's a once I'm can we
got<00:06:32.940> from<00:06:33.180> each<00:06:33.450> side<00:06:33.810> so<00:06:35.330> yeah<00:06:38.150> you<00:06:39.150> could

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.080 
got from each side so yeah you could
send<00:06:39.690> it<00:06:39.870> down<00:06:40.080> more<00:06:40.380> if<00:06:40.500> you<00:06:40.590> buy<00:06:40.800> because<00:06:41.520> all
