 I used to be a dancer even if you had it 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:35.910
 no longer looks like that and yes I live 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:37.649
 this business awaits the clientele

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.510
 here this spectrum of diversity too 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.510
 exploit 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.880
 12 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.890
 the games catwalk training in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.510
 male model agency has from the customer- 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.440
 own models for other models 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.450
 other agencies but also quite normal 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.180

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.930

 our target group is diversified 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.189

 the feeling of going home 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 To be a model means to be a service provider 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 there it just belongs to certain 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.939
 bring along characteristics 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.950
 discipline punctuality and to do that 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.299
 what she was booked for and from 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.619
 moment where she still on one 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.520
 bring sympathetic way over 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.520
 she will succeed 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.690
 We offer each model its own 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 facebook page has its own homepage 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.620
 perfect catwalk training and thus 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.239
 I hope the model is the best possible 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.239
 to prepare and to market perfectly 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.310
 The Saarland offers short paths we have 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.200
 near belgium and holland one is 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.700
 relatively quickly of Switzerland in Italy 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.700
 Paris in an hour 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.010
 I am responsible for this 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.410
 decided because that's it 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.420
 reflects what we represent 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.760
 the so-called castle velden horst 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.700
 who was in 1871 on board that is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.730
 we want to write history and that 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.110
 whole model and just offers this 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.550
 implement the concept in one spot and 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.550
