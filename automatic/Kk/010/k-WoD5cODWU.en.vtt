00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 sniper yes she dear is worth 5 bucks but 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 what the hell are hitman who 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.570
 did it yourself square enix everyone has been waiting for 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.149
 hits on mobile devices but 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 got hitman go tactical game 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.480
 shooter in principle a good game but if 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 you wanted action on you definitely not 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 arranged but a new hitman sniper this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.520
 practically what you need 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.530
 as I said here to you not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 liked this hitman brazier sniper 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.210
 partially corrects the situation why 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 partially just this is not a complete series 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.630
 hitman where you could move around 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.939
 map using different styles 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.619
 passing game and a bunch of weapons this mode 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 sniper where you have to sitting in 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.920
 shelter to find the enemy on location and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.659
 gently handle it with 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.030
 there are many sniper rifles 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.950
 graphics levels on the unity engine and the mass 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 interesting sniper gear but 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 make a reservation right away if you are not a fan of the series 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 hitman you probably shouldn't spend 5 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 bucks for a mobile game and if you are like me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.579
 waited for the continuation of the bald special agent 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 then let it roll on the phone 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.150
 interesting time killer if you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.979
 suddenly hitman hit the game and decide 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.780
 tell about it to the world by writing 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.210
 video review then the next application you 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.159
 just need the program you ciara 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.899
 either unlimited screen recorder 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.189
 It is designed to record video from 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.899
 screen of your device 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.430
 now you donâ€™t need to root 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.740
 record high-quality video from the screen 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.689
 smartphone or tablet unlimited screen 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 recorder is distributed for free settings 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.439
 applications you can choose the bitrate and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.430
 video quality video is recorded as 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.500
 in games and on the desktop 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 device received file is saved 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.759
 mp4 resolution full hd 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.469
 just be careful if during 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.330
 video recording you accidentally block 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.920
 smartphone screen application will stop 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.459
 record and automatically save the file 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.459
 a record 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.420
 a very simple question how to add two 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.710
 big numbers and fast and the answer is obvious 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.510
 use the calculator on 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.350
 smartphone but it so happened that relatives 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.510
 calculator on our smartphones 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.220
 constantly lost their labor find yes and in 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.140
 In principle, they are uncomfortable with their marker and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.640
 Found an interesting alternative to the native 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.380
 calculator for android program 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.540
 called trite calculator plus 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.220
 plus why I like him exactly my 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 beautiful tiled design comfortable 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.790
 It has a function of the clipboard and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 the main thing when you install it you get 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.910
 two shortcuts to launch the program in a full window 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.680
 and in miniature 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.420
 I most often use it in 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.070
 The last mode is very convenient 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.750
 simultaneously sit in the browser or 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.010
 messengers and perform calculations do not 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.930
 switching between windows 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.460
 if you know some good calculator 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.460
 write in the comments I will try 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.090
 I never thought that I would use 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.900
 opera company software 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.460
 for me 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.800
 operas remained somewhere in the past where 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.780
 stayed windows 98 and computers Pentium 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.370
 but it turns out for mobile devices and 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.440
 there is not only an interesting browser 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.450
 the application is called opera max and it 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.760
 allows you to save traffic using wai 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.950
 fi it would seem why saves traffic 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.020
 using wifi and here's one reason 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.450
 last year we went with the guys in 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.880
 barcelona there i bought a 3g card with 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.800
 traffic per gigabyte per month and i don't 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.930
 thought about giving out internet 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.670
 their friends will have their devices 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.709
 perceive my smartphone as normal 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.880
 stupid router and what happens x times 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.770
 oil connects to the router 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.690
 full person automatically update 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.459
 all programs and download some files 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.410
 so we spent half a day 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.360
 700 megabytes of traffic, but if 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.860
 I had an opera max application then with 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.050
 nobody would have downloaded 700 megabytes 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640
 traffic for half a day it would be great 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.410
 so download the app try 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.090
 configure it to limit some 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.800
 applications that suck information on 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.390
 wifi and see how he takes in 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.550
 traffic is very interesting and finally 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.650
 another small application that 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.959
 oddly enough, it also has a + sign 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.280
 the name is called on contacts + this 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.870
 convenient application to work with 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
 phone book after installing this 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.709
 applications will offer you to install more 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.300
 and the dialer is the same company 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.250
 what I highly recommend you do 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.510
 application contacts + you can 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.580
 send sms to make phone 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.900
 calls and work with phonebook in 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.130
 it is very simple but at the same time 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.960
 friendly interface 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.910
 contact icons are made in the form 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.900
 large round icons clicking on the icon 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.340
 contacts 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.020
 these choose a large number of options 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.759
 user interactions from 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.650
 banal to touch with before sending 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.940
 messages in twitter or sending your 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.919
 coordinates on the map friends do not forget 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.380
 subscribe to our channel on our group 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.940
