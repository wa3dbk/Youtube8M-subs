stats<00:00:40.989> now<00:00:41.989> this<00:00:42.289> does<00:00:42.530> not<00:00:42.710> include<00:00:43.010> archery

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
stats now this does not include archery

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630 
stats now this does not include archery
because<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.960> can't<00:00:45.260> hit<00:00:45.980> endermen<00:00:46.489> with<00:00:47.089> them

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
because you can't hit endermen with them

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.279 
because you can't hit endermen with them
and<00:00:50.289> I<00:00:51.289> suppose<00:00:51.920> taming<00:00:52.370> could<00:00:52.550> work<00:00:52.760> but<00:00:53.600> it

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
and I suppose taming could work but it

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.139 
and I suppose taming could work but it
would<00:00:54.440> take<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.920> bit<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.730> planning<00:00:56.690> beforehand

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
would take a bit of planning beforehand

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.209 
would take a bit of planning beforehand
those<00:00:59.149> will<00:00:59.390> work<00:00:59.420> for<00:00:59.809> ax<00:00:59.989> swords<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
those will work for ax swords and the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.540 
those will work for ax swords and the
unarmed<00:01:01.929> now<00:01:02.929> what<00:01:03.109> you<00:01:03.140> want<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:03.980> start<00:01:04.280> doing

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
unarmed now what you want to start doing

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.350 
unarmed now what you want to start doing
in<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.590> end<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.190> want<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.880> have<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.000> portal

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
in the end you want to have a portal

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.080 
in the end you want to have a portal
here<00:01:08.390> at<00:01:08.840> first<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.979> want<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.340> create<00:01:10.610> a

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
here at first and you want to create a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.880 
here at first and you want to create a
ceiling<00:01:13.240> generally<00:01:14.240> 3<00:01:14.600> by<00:01:14.750> 3<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:15.260> can<00:01:15.410> be<00:01:15.620> a<00:01:15.650> bit

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
ceiling generally 3 by 3 it can be a bit

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.570 
ceiling generally 3 by 3 it can be a bit
figure<00:01:16.250> if<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.820> really<00:01:17.690> want<00:01:17.870> it<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.020> be<00:01:18.260> and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
figure if you really want it to be and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.260 
figure if you really want it to be and
then<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.840> want<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.050> make<00:01:21.140> sure<00:01:21.170> it's<00:01:22.270> three

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
then you want to make sure it's three

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.810 
then you want to make sure it's three
blocks<00:01:23.390> off<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.890> ground<00:01:25.130> you're<00:01:25.340> standing<00:01:25.700> on

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
blocks off the ground you're standing on

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.230 
blocks off the ground you're standing on
so<00:01:26.480> you'll<00:01:26.960> have<00:01:27.110> two<00:01:27.350> blocks<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:27.770> between

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
so you'll have two blocks in between

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.510 
so you'll have two blocks in between
endermen<00:01:29.240> are<00:01:29.450> too<00:01:29.720> short<00:01:30.200> don't<00:01:31.100> walk<00:01:31.340> out

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
endermen are too short don't walk out

pretty quickly as my levels are a little

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.640 
pretty quickly as my levels are a little
bit<00:02:41.040> high<00:02:41.190> already<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:41.850> 259<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:43.380> i'm<00:02:43.470> still

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.340 
this can meet you a lot of experience
without<00:03:01.890> an<00:03:02.040> XP<00:03:02.370> grinder<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.990> do<00:03:04.140> get

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
without an XP grinder and you do get

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.780 
without an XP grinder and you do get
tons<00:03:04.710> of<00:03:05.120> ender<00:03:06.120> pearls<00:03:06.810> as<00:03:06.990> well<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
tons of ender pearls as well and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.070 
tons of ender pearls as well and
sometimes<00:03:08.790> with<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.270> design<00:03:09.600> though<00:03:09.870> they

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
sometimes with this design though they

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.460 
sometimes with this design though they
tend<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.470> get<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.160> top<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.580> platform<00:03:11.820> but

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
tend to get on top of this platform but

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
tend to get on top of this platform but
you<00:03:13.470> can<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.710> just<00:03:13.860> walk<00:03:14.010> out<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.370> they'll

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
you can you just walk out and they'll

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.400 
you can you just walk out and they'll
drop<00:03:14.730> down<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:18.890> that's<00:03:19.890> about<00:03:20.190> it
