00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
control up here which I can control with

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
control up here which I can control with
this<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.210> which<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> use<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.320> they're

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
this so which one do I use and they're

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
this so which one do I use and they're
totally<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:52.740> formats<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.060> it's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
totally different formats to which it's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
totally different formats to which it's
just<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> mean<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.200> bad<00:01:55.619> design<00:01:56.009> I've

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
just I mean that's just bad design I've

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.929 
just I mean that's just bad design I've
got<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.210> decent<00:01:57.750> navigation<00:01:58.649> system<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.460> hard

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
got a decent navigation system here hard

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.510 
got a decent navigation system here hard
drive<00:02:00.180> based<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> maps<00:02:01.799> load<00:02:02.189> pretty

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
drive based so the maps load pretty

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760 
drive based so the maps load pretty

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
quickly a live traffic and little route

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
quickly a live traffic and little route
around<00:02:05.130> traffic<00:02:05.340> dam<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.000> good<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

so<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:34.890> green<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.610> should<00:02:36.210> tell<00:02:36.420> me<00:02:36.570> it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
so it's green that should tell me it's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.140 
so it's green that should tell me it's
on<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> actually<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.760> push<00:02:38.970> this

mitigation<00:02:48.720> system<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.770> different

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
mitigation system it's a different

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.040 
mitigation system it's a different
system<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.060> similar<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:51.930> these

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
system but kind of similar and so these

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.630 
system but kind of similar and so these

here a lot of sound in the cabin and
that<00:03:41.460> just<00:03:41.610> tells<00:03:41.760> me<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.210> a<00:03:42.570> cure<00:03:42.960> didn't

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
that just tells me that a cure didn't
