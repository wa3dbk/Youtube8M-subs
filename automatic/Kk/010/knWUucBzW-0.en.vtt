00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.579
 the height of summer on the banks of rivers and lakes came out 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.749
 the growing army of Moscow nakhlystovikov 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:19.109
 Today we will consider the situation when 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.060
 start fishing you understand that your 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.480
 calculation on a set of flies that you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.179
 grabbed from home was not justified 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 if you of course eat it to us 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.320
 tell the faces of the president of Moscow 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.320
 club casting gennady fry 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 Well, let's try now using 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.540
 those tools and materials that we 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.750
 took with me 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 bind imitation of the very nymph that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.949
 found in coastal reeds 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:06.979
 use hooks read heavy 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.979
 suitable for making them 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.359
 to start 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.070
 make some kind of foundation thread 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.020
 as 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.190
 tail use feathers wood boat 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.190
 by just mandarin 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.340
 mother need to watch that feathers in the wind 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.340
 did not fly away 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.479
 for the body we do not use special 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.729
 synthetic material to be called 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.120
 truncheon in order to be well 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.340
 kept on the assembly thread 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.000
 we will process a special thread 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.899
 wax 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.600
 in this case the fiber is a baton very 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.140
 keeps well directly 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.140
 assembly thread 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.150
 our goal now is to make a mouse body 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.260
 yes mats to about two-thirds length 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.260
 hook owl. 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.860
 we need 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.310
 again take 1 tree boat and 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.140
 to make from one bunch of feathers 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.239
 simultaneously and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.239
 rudiments of wings to him and and mnogko 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.780
 impose on top 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.239
 make a few turns 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.620
 we cut off the excess you before 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.620
 imposes 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.000
 feather over winding 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.150
 anchoring the blood germ segments a 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.379
 tip of pen 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:41.319
 here and pick up the legs tucking them back 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.319
 evenly distributed right and left and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:52.720
 we make a winding assembly thread 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.720
 make head 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.880
 can be slightly corrected 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.579
 in order to do finally 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:16.090
 use a special knotter which 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:16.090
 helps to make a neat and comfortable 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.879
 we cut the assembly no 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.320
 I am now doing the standard scheme 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.000
 there is exactly the same i would do at home 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:38.230
 on use this tool we have 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.610
 opportunities to make can 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.330
 directly pond last 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.170
 the final stage is the application of varnish on 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.740
 head to fly 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.480
 fix 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.000
 knot and giving the front sight 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.180
 natural shine actually fly 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.920
 ready and in five minutes you can start 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.400
 to catch her when we wait when 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.400
 the varnish will dry
