00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to a light when you go into into super

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
to a light when you go into into super
slow-mo<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.890> there<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:28.979> that's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
slow-mo and there we are that's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.880 
slow-mo and there we are that's
basically<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.710> bit

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
basically how to do it now a little bit

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
basically how to do it now a little bit
more<00:01:32.159> detail<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.720> say<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.960> wanted

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
more detail on that let's say you wanted

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.499 
more detail on that let's say you wanted
to<00:01:34.380> record<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:35.640> handy<00:01:36.210> end

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to record with the very handy end

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.280 
to record with the very handy end
trigger<00:01:37.140> rather<00:01:37.560> than<00:01:37.799> start<00:01:38.130> trigger<00:01:38.750> or<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
trigger rather than start trigger or the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410 
trigger rather than start trigger or the
half<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.890> half<00:01:41.040> mode<00:01:41.549> which<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.329> know

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
half and half mode which is you know

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
half and half mode which is you know
halfway<00:01:42.630> between<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.079> two<00:01:43.259> end<00:01:43.979> trigger

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
halfway between the two end trigger

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
seconds prior to pressing the record
button<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.220> you're<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> situation<00:01:50.670> where

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
quite sure when which you know could be

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.550 
quite sure when which you know could be
happen<00:01:55.320> fairly<00:01:55.560> often<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:55.979> slow<00:01:56.159> motion<00:01:57.560> you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
happen fairly often with slow motion you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
happen fairly often with slow motion you
can<00:01:58.710> set<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.759> once<00:01:59.969> that's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
can set it to that and then once that's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
can set it to that and then once that's
happened<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.439> press<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.060> record

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
happened you then press the record

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.069 
happened you then press the record
button<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.469> will<00:02:04.530> record<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.280> cached

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
button and it will record it's cached

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.210 
button and it will record it's cached
video<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.500> point<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.069> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
video up to that point so it's really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.180 
video up to that point so it's really
cool<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.629> want<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> set<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.920> in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
cool so if you want to set that or in

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.740 
cool so if you want to set that or in
fact<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.550> want<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> change<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.599> can

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
fact if you want to change the you can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.820 
fact if you want to change the you can
change<00:02:12.989> what<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.349> essent

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
change what the essent

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.730 
change what the essent
you<00:02:13.920> button<00:02:14.250> does<00:02:14.460> say<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.910> wanted<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.390> shoot

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740

fast<00:02:16.740> motion<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:18.050> time-lapse<00:02:19.050> stuff<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.860> can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
fast motion or time-lapse stuff you can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.270 
fast motion or time-lapse stuff you can
set<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.850> as<00:02:21.090> well<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:22.710> depends<00:02:23.190> how

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
set it to that as well so it depends how

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
set it to that as well so it depends how
you<00:02:23.340> setup<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.820> button<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.750> which<00:02:24.930> mode<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
you setup the button as to which mode it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.780 
you setup the button as to which mode it
goes<00:02:25.680> into<00:02:25.980> when<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.190> press<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.580> but

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
goes into when you press it but

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
goes into when you press it but
generally<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.450> at<00:02:27.660> sloop<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.200> slow<00:02:28.350> motion

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
generally it's at sloop of slow motion

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.530 
generally it's at sloop of slow motion
as<00:02:28.830> default<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.370> let's<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.240> go<00:02:30.330> into<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

as default so let's just go into the
menu<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.410> what<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.620> mean

been<00:02:55.590> doing<00:02:55.950> mostly<00:02:56.420> recently<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.320> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
been doing mostly recently but it is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.740 
been doing mostly recently but it is
dependent<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.610> on<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.300> you're<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.630> do

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
dependent on on what you're going to do

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.900 
dependent on on what you're going to do
and<00:03:01.560> then<00:03:01.680> execute<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.430> make<00:03:02.580> sure<00:03:02.610> it's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and then execute that to make sure it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.670 
and then execute that to make sure it's
it<00:03:03.330> sort<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.570> saved<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.260> you'll

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
it sort of saved it and then you'll

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.160
