football 14 is real-time physics this
provides<00:01:29.840> us<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.049> unpredictable<00:01:30.590> outcomes

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
provides us with unpredictable outcomes

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.450 
provides us with unpredictable outcomes
and<00:01:31.549> limitless<00:01:31.880> variety<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:33.500> user<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.280> be

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
able to do user like basis if they are

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.630 
able to do user like basis if they are
that<00:01:37.729> player<00:01:39.159> yeah<00:01:40.159> I'm<00:01:40.250> gonna<00:01:40.340> replicate

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
that player yeah I'm gonna replicate

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.190

what<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.360> player<00:01:41.569> would<00:01:41.750> do<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.020> real<00:01:42.140> life

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
what that player would do in real life

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.340 
what that player would do in real life
I'm<00:01:42.920> everyone<00:01:43.310> gonna<00:01:43.429> love<00:01:43.640> that

it's<00:01:49.950> pretty<00:01:50.159> much<00:01:50.280> natural<00:01:50.549> he's<00:01:51.150> kind<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it's pretty much natural he's kind of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's pretty much natural he's kind of
like<00:01:51.600> real<00:01:51.840> light

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
this video with the Oregon running backs

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.830 
this video with the Oregon running backs
is<00:02:26.860> absolutely<00:02:27.760> hilarious<00:02:27.880> they<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.720> do

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
is absolutely hilarious they have to do

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.240 
is absolutely hilarious they have to do
something<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.200> fix<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.470> if<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.040> that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
something to fix that if it's like that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.220 
something to fix that if it's like that
I<00:02:30.459> mean<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.180> worse<00:02:31.480> than<00:02:31.510> last<00:02:31.870> year

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
I mean that that's worse than last year

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.160 
I mean that that's worse than last year
arm<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:33.300> never<00:02:34.300> even<00:02:34.420> seen<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.900> from<00:02:34.989> last

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
arm I never even seen that from last

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.630 
arm I never even seen that from last
year<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.500> hopefully<00:02:35.590> they<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.310> doesn't

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
year so hopefully they that doesn't

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180 
year so hopefully they that doesn't
happen<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> release<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.709> moreover<00:02:38.980> I'm

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
happen on the release but moreover I'm

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.880 
happen on the release but moreover I'm
more<00:02:39.370> worried<00:02:39.700> about<00:02:40.020> offense<00:02:41.020> now<00:02:41.110> I'm<00:02:41.350> glad

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
more worried about offense now I'm glad

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.220 
more worried about offense now I'm glad
that<00:02:41.920> they<00:02:42.220> are<00:02:42.400> improving<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.660> running<00:02:44.050> game

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
that they are improving the running game

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.440 
that they are improving the running game

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
I kind of feel like especially in

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.350 
I kind of feel like especially in
college<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.700> running<00:02:48.910> game<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.239> more

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
college that the running game is more

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.460 
college that the running game is more
important<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.810> college<00:02:50.050> because<00:02:50.170> most

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
important in college because most

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.170 
important in college because most
college<00:02:50.800> teams<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:51.250> run<00:02:51.610> run<00:02:51.790> run<00:02:51.970> run<00:02:52.120> run

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
college teams just run run run run run

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.520 
college teams just run run run run run
non-stop<00:02:52.810> they're<00:02:53.230> running<00:02:53.410> with<00:02:53.500> the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
non-stop they're running with the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.660 
non-stop they're running with the
quarterback<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.100> running<00:02:54.310> with<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.489> running

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
quarterback the running with a running

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.800

back the running with the backup running

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.650 
back the running with the backup running
back<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.620> uh<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.160> kind<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.520> feel<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.700> NCAA<00:02:58.060> has

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
back and uh I kind of feel like NCAA has

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.870 
back and uh I kind of feel like NCAA has
way<00:02:59.170> too<00:02:59.230> many<00:02:59.470> passing<00:03:00.340> plays<00:03:00.519> they<00:03:00.730> have

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
way too many passing plays they have

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.789 
way too many passing plays they have
it's<00:03:01.090> basically<00:03:01.630> any<00:03:01.870> passing<00:03:02.290> play<00:03:02.440> that's

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
it's basically any passing play that's

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.140 
it's basically any passing play that's
in<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.489> mad<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:03.970> fact

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
in there is going to be mad and in fact

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.430 
in there is going to be mad and in fact
I<00:03:04.330> feel<00:03:04.480> like<00:03:04.570> there's<00:03:04.780> sometimes<00:03:04.989> even

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I feel like there's sometimes even

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.670 
I feel like there's sometimes even
better<00:03:05.620> passing<00:03:05.920> plays<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.549> NC<00:03:07.060> double-a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
better passing plays and NC double-a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.979 
better passing plays and NC double-a
then<00:03:08.680> there<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.070> Madden<00:03:09.459> games<00:03:09.670> um<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.840> it's

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
then there is in Madden games um so it's

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.410 
then there is in Madden games um so it's
a<00:03:11.049> little<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:12.040> know<00:03:12.160> helter<00:03:12.820> skelter<00:03:12.850> it's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
a little you know helter skelter it's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.990 
a little you know helter skelter it's
kind<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.810> chaotic<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:15.190> hopefully<00:03:15.820> they<00:03:15.970> fix

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
kind of chaotic but hopefully they fix
