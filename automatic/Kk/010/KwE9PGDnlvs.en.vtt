00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
no damage over on the sides looks like

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.190 
no damage over on the sides looks like
it's<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> corner<00:02:25.660> with<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> pretty

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's just in the corner with a pretty

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.830 
it's just in the corner with a pretty
good<00:02:26.350> dent<00:02:26.700> alright<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:27.970> as<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.330> saw<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
good dent alright so as you saw in the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
good dent alright so as you saw in the
previous<00:02:29.200> test<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.069> iPhone<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.610> didn't

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
previous test the iPhone really didn't

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.010 
previous test the iPhone really didn't
fare<00:02:30.940> very<00:02:30.970> well<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:31.450> that's<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.690> reason<00:02:31.840> why

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
fare very well but that's the reason why

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.630 
fare very well but that's the reason why
we<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> test<00:02:32.620> from<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.830> pocket<00:02:33.280> because

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
we do the test from the pocket because

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.070 
we do the test from the pocket because
as<00:02:33.940> you're<00:02:34.120> taking<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.390> phone<00:02:34.600> away<00:02:34.810> from

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
as you're taking the phone away from

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.570 
as you're taking the phone away from
your<00:02:35.200> pocket<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.620> could<00:02:35.739> fall<00:02:35.920> any<00:02:36.069> which<00:02:36.370> way

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
your pocket it could fall any which way

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.210 
your pocket it could fall any which way
but<00:02:37.030> fortunately<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> iPhone<00:02:37.780> 5s<00:02:38.200> came<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.100> a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
but fortunately the iPhone 5s came up a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.920 
but fortunately the iPhone 5s came up a
little<00:02:39.340> bit<00:02:39.519> short<00:02:39.550> had<00:02:40.120> some<00:02:40.269> bad<00:02:40.420> luck<00:02:40.630> and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
little bit short had some bad luck and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
little bit short had some bad luck and
just<00:02:41.470> fell<00:02:41.590> right<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.950> its<00:02:42.100> face<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.550> now

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
just fell right on its face but now

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.309 
just fell right on its face but now
we're<00:02:43.150> gonna<00:02:43.269> move<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.750> next<00:02:43.900> test<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
we're gonna move on to the next test and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.800 
we're gonna move on to the next test and
that<00:02:44.470> would<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:45.300> dropping<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.420> from<00:02:46.569> around

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that would be dropping it from around

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.640 
that would be dropping it from around
the<00:02:46.959> chest<00:02:47.260> area

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
the chest area

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.440 
the chest area
so<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.640> also<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.880> pretty<00:02:49.060> common<00:02:49.330> scenario

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so this is also a pretty common scenario

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.820 
so this is also a pretty common scenario
someone<00:02:50.080> bumps<00:02:50.350> into<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.560> while<00:02:50.709> you're

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
someone bumps into you while you're

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.050 
someone bumps into you while you're
holding<00:02:50.920> your<00:02:51.100> phone<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.519> drops<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:51.790> onto

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
holding your phone just drops right onto

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.790 
holding your phone just drops right onto
the<00:02:52.150> floor<00:02:52.330> from<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.959> chest<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.680> see

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
the floor from the chest you can see

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.100 
the floor from the chest you can see
what<00:02:53.920> my<00:02:54.010> hand<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.310> right<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.640> and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.710 

all<00:03:02.860> right<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:04.150> time<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.450> didn't<00:03:04.630> fall

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
all right so this time you didn't fall

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.830 
all right so this time you didn't fall
on<00:03:04.810> its<00:03:04.930> face<00:03:05.110> thankfully<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.880> instead<00:03:07.690> it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
on its face thankfully but instead it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.130 
on its face thankfully but instead it
fell<00:03:07.990> right<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.530> its<00:03:09.430> bottom<00:03:09.970> right<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
fell right on its bottom right on the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.230 
fell right on its bottom right on the
corner<00:03:11.440> right<00:03:11.470> over<00:03:11.620> here

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
corner right over here

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
corner right over here
all<00:03:13.240> right<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.050> right<00:03:14.200> there

all right and as you can see right there

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.450 
all right and as you can see right there
you're<00:03:14.680> gonna<00:03:14.770> get<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.280> bit<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
you're gonna get a little bit of

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.220 
you're gonna get a little bit of
scuffing<00:03:15.850> right<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.240> corner<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.810> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
scuffing right on the corner so the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.080 
scuffing right on the corner so the
aluminum<00:03:17.470> body<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.070> aluminum<00:03:18.490> chassis<00:03:18.520> does

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
aluminum body the aluminum chassis does

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.150 
aluminum body the aluminum chassis does
seem<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.690> holding<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.410> pretty<00:03:20.680> well<00:03:20.920> here

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
seem to be holding a pretty well here

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160 
seem to be holding a pretty well here
and<00:03:21.220> we'll<00:03:21.340> see<00:03:21.490> if<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.700> HTC<00:03:22.210> One<00:03:22.450> has<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and we'll see if the HTC One has the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.930 
and we'll see if the HTC One has the
same<00:03:23.350> luck<00:03:23.590> when<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:23.770> comes<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.130> its<00:03:24.370> aluminum

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
same luck when it comes to its aluminum

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.030 
same luck when it comes to its aluminum
body<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.750> aluminum<00:03:26.140> chassis<00:03:26.320> all<00:03:26.920> right

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
body and it's aluminum chassis all right

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.350 
body and it's aluminum chassis all right
now<00:03:27.160> unfortunately<00:03:27.340> when<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.000> came<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.270> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
now unfortunately when it came to the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.410 
now unfortunately when it came to the
HTC<00:03:28.870> one<00:03:29.080> that<00:03:29.650> little<00:03:30.070> speaker<00:03:30.880> grill<00:03:31.120> cover

HTC one that little speaker grill cover

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.949 
HTC one that little speaker grill cover
just<00:03:32.230> happened<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.709> well<00:03:33.310> pop<00:03:33.700> off<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.240> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
just happened to well pop off and the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.420 
just happened to well pop off and the
adhesive<00:03:35.170> does<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.590> look<00:03:35.709> like<00:03:35.860> it's<00:03:36.100> able<00:03:36.280> to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
adhesive does it look like it's able to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.630 
adhesive does it look like it's able to
keep<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.450> cover<00:03:37.630> on<00:03:37.870> even<00:03:38.260> after<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.500> tried<00:03:38.770> HTC

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
keep the cover on even after I tried HTC

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:48.070 
keep the cover on even after I tried HTC
one<00:03:39.790> test<00:03:40.060> from<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.300> chest<00:03:40.630> right<00:03:40.930> over<00:03:41.080> here

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.440 

that<00:03:48.680> same<00:03:48.980> corner<00:03:49.310> got<00:03:49.580> hit<00:03:49.790> again<00:03:50.240> and

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
that same corner got hit again and

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.900 
that same corner got hit again and
because<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.350> aluminum<00:03:51.920> on<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.160> front<00:03:52.670> is

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
because that aluminum on the front is

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.390 
because that aluminum on the front is
not<00:03:53.390> there<00:03:53.690> anymore<00:03:53.960> it<00:03:54.560> doesn't<00:03:54.620> make<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.220> so

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
not there anymore it doesn't make it so

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.790 
not there anymore it doesn't make it so
that<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.940> phone<00:03:56.930> has<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.230> little<00:03:57.530> bit<00:03:57.620> less

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
that the phone has a little bit less

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.710 
that the phone has a little bit less
protection<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.730> what<00:03:58.880> ended<00:03:59.030> up<00:03:59.120> happening<00:03:59.180> is

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
protection so what ended up happening is

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.650 
protection so what ended up happening is
you<00:04:00.190> got<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.220> little<00:04:01.460> bit<00:04:01.550> of<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.820> bigger<00:04:02.330> dent

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
you got a little bit of a bigger dent

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.420 
you got a little bit of a bigger dent
there<00:04:02.840> it's<00:04:02.960> like<00:04:03.020> it<00:04:03.170> pushed<00:04:03.380> it<00:04:03.560> right<00:04:03.740> in<00:04:03.920> so

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
there it's like it pushed it right in so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.920 
there it's like it pushed it right in so
we're<00:04:04.610> back<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.940> iPhone<00:04:05.240> again<00:04:05.480> for<00:04:05.720> our

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
for the iPhone just it's landing on its

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.029 
for the iPhone just it's landing on its
face<00:04:33.610> every<00:04:34.000> single<00:04:34.030> time<00:04:34.680> well<00:04:35.680> not<00:04:35.800> every

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
face every single time well not every

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.390 
face every single time well not every
time<00:04:36.190> but<00:04:36.360> we<00:04:37.360> turn<00:04:37.509> on<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.690> phone<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.400> it

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
does look like it still works but it

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.869 
does look like it still works but it
would<00:04:41.440> be<00:04:41.560> dangerous<00:04:41.919> to<00:04:42.159> use<00:04:42.340> because<00:04:42.759> if

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
would be dangerous to use because if

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.100 
would be dangerous to use because if

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
you're going around you might get cut by

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.170 
you're going around you might get cut by
the<00:04:44.139> glass<00:04:44.409> dust<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.949> is<00:04:45.039> forming<00:04:45.729> around<00:04:45.879> on

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
the glass dust that is forming around on

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.850 
the glass dust that is forming around on
all<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.479> those<00:04:46.569> shatters<00:04:46.990> let's<00:04:47.500> take<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.740> look

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
all of those shatters let's take a look

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.080 
all of those shatters let's take a look
around<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.190> phone<00:04:48.370> doesn't<00:04:48.699> look<00:04:48.789> like<00:04:48.909> there

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
around the phone doesn't look like there

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.219 
around the phone doesn't look like there
are<00:04:49.360> really<00:04:49.659> any<00:04:50.909> real<00:04:51.909> damages<00:04:52.479> across<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
are really any real damages across the

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.779 
are really any real damages across the
phone<00:04:53.409> aside<00:04:53.710> from<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.039> screen<00:04:54.280> so<00:04:54.669> we're

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
phone aside from the screen so we're

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.790 
phone aside from the screen so we're
gonna<00:04:54.879> move<00:04:55.030> on<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.419> HTC<00:04:55.870> One<00:04:56.080> alright<00:04:56.590> so

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
gonna move on to the HTC One alright so

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.930 
gonna move on to the HTC One alright so
let's<00:04:57.009> just<00:04:57.039> go<00:04:57.190> ahead<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.400> get<00:04:57.520> right<00:04:57.669> on<00:04:57.789> to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
let's just go ahead and get right on to

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.640 
let's just go ahead and get right on to
it<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.659> coding<00:04:58.900> from<00:04:58.960> head<00:04:59.139> height<00:04:59.349> leaning

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
it so coding from head height leaning

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.689 
it so coding from head height leaning
forward<00:04:59.919> a<00:04:59.949> little<00:05:00.069> bit<00:05:00.159> let's<00:05:00.430> see<00:05:00.580> what

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
forward a little bit let's see what

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:12.890 
forward a little bit let's see what
happens<00:05:00.940> when<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.150> drops<00:05:01.330> here<00:05:01.539> we<00:05:01.599> go

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.930 

again<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.950> didn't<00:05:14.130> fall<00:05:14.250> on<00:05:14.400> its<00:05:14.520> face<00:05:14.700> so

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
again it didn't fall on its face so

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.160 
again it didn't fall on its face so
perhaps<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.390> has<00:05:15.600> something<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:15.960> do<00:05:16.140> with

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
perhaps that has something to do with

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.380 
perhaps that has something to do with
the<00:05:16.440> balancing<00:05:16.980> on<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.160> phone<00:05:17.310> itself<00:05:17.640> so

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
the balancing on the phone itself so

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.290 
the balancing on the phone itself so
what<00:05:18.840> we're<00:05:18.930> looking<00:05:19.140> at<00:05:19.230> here<00:05:19.290> is<00:05:20.150> really<00:05:21.150> no

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
what we're looking at here is really no

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.060

the most part though the phone is still
working<00:05:37.710> just<00:05:38.010> fine<00:05:38.220> as<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:39.240> can<00:05:39.390> see<00:05:39.570> there

this<00:05:40.530> big<00:05:40.800> blemish<00:05:41.280> down<00:05:41.430> here<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.700> the<00:05:41.790> bottom

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
this big blemish down here on the bottom

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.330 
this big blemish down here on the bottom
of<00:05:42.210> course<00:05:42.420> is<00:05:42.600> something<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.080> leave<00:05:43.950> desired

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
of course is something to leave desired

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.190 
of course is something to leave desired
but<00:05:44.670> it<00:05:45.120> looks<00:05:45.300> like<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.540> phone<00:05:45.720> itself<00:05:46.020> is

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
but it looks like the phone itself is

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.200 
but it looks like the phone itself is
working<00:05:46.620> just<00:05:46.830> fine<00:05:47.250> as<00:05:47.640> far<00:05:47.790> as<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:47.970> screen

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.460 
working just fine as far as the screen
goes<00:05:48.420> so<00:05:48.570> we'll<00:05:48.720> see<00:05:48.840> what<00:05:48.990> we<00:05:49.080> can<00:05:49.200> do<00:05:49.350> about

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470

you<00:07:05.020> can<00:07:05.170> see<00:07:05.350> it's<00:07:05.950> the<00:07:06.100> screams<00:07:06.460> that<00:07:06.730> have

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
you can see it's the screams that have

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.160 
you can see it's the screams that have
the<00:07:06.970> most<00:07:07.150> damage<00:07:07.450> because<00:07:07.660> these<00:07:07.750> aluminum

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
the most damage because these aluminum

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.810 
the most damage because these aluminum
bodies<00:07:08.440> actually<00:07:08.650> have<00:07:09.100> a<00:07:09.310> pretty<00:07:09.550> good

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
bodies actually have a pretty good

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.670 
bodies actually have a pretty good
sturdiness<00:07:10.150> to<00:07:10.420> them<00:07:10.570> and<00:07:10.780> so<00:07:11.320> that's

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
sturdiness to them and so that's

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.560 
sturdiness to them and so that's
probably<00:07:11.920> a<00:07:12.130> good<00:07:12.280> choice<00:07:12.460> on<00:07:12.700> HTC<00:07:13.240> in<00:07:13.390> order

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
probably a good choice on HTC in order

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.390 
probably a good choice on HTC in order
to<00:07:13.720> make<00:07:13.870> their<00:07:14.050> phone<00:07:14.320> somewhat<00:07:15.070> similar<00:07:15.370> to

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
to make their phone somewhat similar to

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.710 
to make their phone somewhat similar to
the<00:07:15.550> iPhone<00:07:15.670> five<00:07:16.000> and<00:07:16.180> that<00:07:16.270> it<00:07:16.360> has<00:07:16.480> these

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
the iPhone five and that it has these

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.030 
the iPhone five and that it has these
glass<00:07:17.110> screen<00:07:17.350> on<00:07:17.470> the<00:07:17.560> front<00:07:17.800> with<00:07:18.010> the
