00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.240
 the poor people i want to introduce you @ today the IG actually 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.459
 then got granted by the developer 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.519
 and 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.769
 yes she wants to Schultze planning "I have just now 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.320
 what you see supports multitasking 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.980
 so is very fast 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.609
 yes, at the very beginning »can make different plans i just have it 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.080
 not for the tenth grade 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
 adjusted 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.190
 and at the beginning there is already a plan a 1 then you can do so and what second 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.689
 cookie 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.249
 because you do not need her anymore 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.920
 and 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 if you go here now to the a kid 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.140
 Coach Matthias Karns is subordinated when they are deleting a plan too 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 all exams homework grades 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 and all other data belonging to this plan is deleted 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.590
 Are you sure you want that? 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.460
 there may be some FIAC 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 Jan just make a new badge Jung if the small plus 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770
 during the World Cup took 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.589
 my thing now four times APA 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.700
 PC Lock years 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.250
 ABC does not matter 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.030
 he is concerned with the principle 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.120
 then we have hours per day 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.910
 Dede can enter the GPS 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.920
 50 um 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.710
 something unrealistic 50 hours a day 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.220
 my day also has 25 hours i know 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.560
 So something not quite so realistic 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.720
 up to 8 hours a day at school and now he tells me 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.899
 «I think it's possible to lose data 50 hours before 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.070
 had stopped 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.620
 but it does not matter 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.080
 I had Manz registered then we have the four days a week 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.320
 is 5 in Germany 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.620
 What site plan means honestly I do not know 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.960
 and he of course that German in grades system 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.450
 We at our school also have Biberacher 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.320
 So you can set this here and you can synonymous all the data 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 swap nobody has set if you already have something 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 then you can use the game to make pretty adjustments in compartments 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.960
 which one has listed here from you can easily 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.040
 to make a new subject of 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.280
 What counts as a new subject here 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.490
 for example 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.869
 follow a high school course 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.869
 yes, what do I know Amy or something 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.200
 to have the love as only Schumi 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.669
 Of course you can also change the color 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.599
 a by just like that through Xcode 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.640
 No selects this color for it 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.300
 you can still give grades for each of them correctly because I have recently 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.300
 Great Power at twelve points 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.010
 then I can also choose lecturers we have at our school actually 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.239
 nobody knows how to draw anything when zooming 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.600
 after his victory 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.549
 You can create a room 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.469
 So our school has different rooms that now all over Game of 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.059
 Taborea in Tokyo 125 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.229
 but I do not think so I'm not so sure about that 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.669
 So you can do everything a role says this gives the school 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.129
 create a path for us 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.889
 Just make a new gift 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.249
 and then the data is updated 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.509
 you do everything you can to adjust everything you have to only through 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.509
 Puddles then you can also import a backup again 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.759
 the family at the plan 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.669
 and can just click on the nice one against the tray 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.689
 No because of math lecturer then could end 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.749
 Unfortunately, I can not go back which annoys me a bit 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.399
 must first click on OK here 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.829
 and when it comes to space, it's the same when I'm here now I'm not coming back 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.230
 if I'm in the ring click or so sunny 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.940
 really rs2 Kate back 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.120
 and then go back here that a little shortcoming also fixed what 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.279
 could be 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.239
 Of course I can also do homework for this 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.750
 and create exams 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.930
 and then carry my whole plan through here should be German or 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.739
 what do I know 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.209
 you can go to the setting where he like all the stuff to 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.779
 Plan he could set 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.679
 her plate a moor and 3 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.529
 So we have Tuesday, the Monday 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:58.219
 and to school Tuesday and Wednesday pretty easy and that 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.900
 The whole timetable Ali Sethi to Jürgen, of course, several exchange 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.230
 settings 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.919
 and nothing is a task 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.169
 Voigt's different homework can do the homework themselves 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.870
 I have already shown you in the subjects 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.870
 you can then look here and the subject and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 planned to sort and of course according to the status 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.949
 then it could very closely demanded parliament so adorn so 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.770
 but also to make organizations 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.810
 all the issues this week and all the homework in one 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.009
 specific subject 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.639
 at FC Sion scores and total grade point average would be lake 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.730
 So now I have what formats computer science 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.449
 can i change the grade 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.749
 for a stir 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.770
 So take 1 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.650
 just as an example and you can also choose the plan 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.960
 is Jana refer because suddenly no notes registered 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.710
 Of course you can also take exams 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.180
 To and when you write which for which subjects 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.439
 in a week 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.129
 since he is the team for which plan I have it only tenth grade here 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.269
 and off I see that but not registered and for the day 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.069
 and then there's another subject 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.559
 a status selection 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.659
 and then only one builds 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.659
 clicking on it here could be directed to the safari browser 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.719
 that show so recently I have liked the video if so could 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.740
 the app of course from the app store store here also finds some 

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:22.839
 Children like the description 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.519
 and there, I could not find the circular he could not find out 

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:29.360
 spared for now 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.139
 therefore 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.500
 I say thanks for looking and see you next time 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.930
 I'm out of it, I realize
