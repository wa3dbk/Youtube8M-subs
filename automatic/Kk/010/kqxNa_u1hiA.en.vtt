conversion<00:03:04.879> so<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.840> sheer<00:03:06.049> size<00:03:06.290> allows<00:03:06.860> us

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
conversion so the sheer size allows us

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.970 
conversion so the sheer size allows us
to<00:03:07.849> have<00:03:07.989> features<00:03:08.989> in<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.290> aircraft<00:03:09.739> which

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
to have features in the aircraft which

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.220 
to have features in the aircraft which
we<00:03:10.129> cannot<00:03:10.430> allow<00:03:10.610> another<00:03:10.970> aircraft<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:12.019> its

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
we cannot allow another aircraft so its

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.589 
we cannot allow another aircraft so its
size<00:03:12.709> for<00:03:13.190> example<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:13.819> can<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.360> upper

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
size for example we can have the upper

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.020 
size for example we can have the upper
deck<00:03:14.810> as<00:03:14.989> private<00:03:15.830> rooms<00:03:16.040> for<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:17.630> owner<00:03:18.590> and

deck as private rooms for the owner and
three<00:03:20.030> rooms<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.049> main<00:03:21.260> deck<00:03:21.530> we<00:03:21.739> can<00:03:21.950> use

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
three rooms and the main deck we can use

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.520 
three rooms and the main deck we can use
for<00:03:22.430> example<00:03:23.209> for<00:03:23.390> efficient<00:03:23.780> for<00:03:24.170> official

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530
