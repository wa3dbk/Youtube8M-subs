when you guys are crouching you guys are
basically<00:00:44.679> head<00:00:44.859> glitching<00:00:45.160> so<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:45.940> can<00:00:46.120> be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
basically head glitching so this can be

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.270 
basically head glitching so this can be
very<00:00:46.449> useful<00:00:46.510> for<00:00:46.839> other<00:00:47.019> game<00:00:47.530> modes<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:48.129> you
