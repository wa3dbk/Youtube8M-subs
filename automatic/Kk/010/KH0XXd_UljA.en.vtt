sleeping and actually functioning and
it's<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.870> getting<00:00:55.050> any<00:00:55.320> better<00:00:55.410> because

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it's not getting any better because

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's not getting any better because
people<00:00:56.309> simply<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.820> treat<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.710> as<00:00:58.710> an

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
people simply don't treat it as a as an

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.430 
people simply don't treat it as a as an
issue<00:00:59.100> worth<00:00:59.579> taking<00:01:00.149> seriously<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.960> once

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
issue worth taking seriously and once

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.869 
issue worth taking seriously and once
you<00:01:01.620> lose<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you lose it you're not going to get it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
you lose it you're not going to get it
back<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.840> example<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
back it's not like for example if you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.320 
back it's not like for example if you
drink<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.549> too<00:01:05.670> much<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.119> young

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
drink a bit too much when you're young

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.969 
drink a bit too much when you're young
and<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.229> overdoing<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and you're not you're not overdoing it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.440 
and you're not you're not overdoing it
then<00:01:08.130> perhaps<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.580> liver<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.970> replenish

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
then perhaps the liver can replenish

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
then perhaps the liver can replenish
itself<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> ears<00:01:10.200> simply<00:01:10.740> don't<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> same

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
itself the ears simply don't do the same

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
itself the ears simply don't do the same
thing<00:01:11.880> yeah<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> begin<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> realize

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
thing yeah when you begin to realize

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
thing yeah when you begin to realize
something's<00:01:14.220> wrong<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.670> might<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.180> too

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
something's wrong it might be a bit too

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
something's wrong it might be a bit too
late<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.040> figures<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.580> sure<00:01:17.759> we

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
late and but this figures are sure we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
late and but this figures are sure we
know<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> third<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.930> people<00:01:19.110> say<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
know there the third of people say that

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.090 
know there the third of people say that
they<00:01:20.520> crank<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.090> their<00:01:21.420> music<00:01:22.140> players<00:01:22.500> above

they crank up their music players above

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.749 
they crank up their music players above
85<00:01:23.939> decibels<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.960> 85<00:01:25.350> decibels<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
85 decibels and 85 decibels as the the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.899 
85 decibels and 85 decibels as the the
safe<00:01:27.090> level<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.680> below<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
safe level and that is just below the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.539 
safe level and that is just below the
volume<00:01:30.479> off<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> pneumatic<00:01:31.560> drill<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.310> know

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
volume off a pneumatic drill so I know

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.069 
volume off a pneumatic drill so I know
