00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.879
 Hello I love to show you how to score in two out of three 6 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.829
 the so-called cross border into the EU 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.119
 or activate Windows 7 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.300
 I have in my case otherwise three point six to nine I have three tabs 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.749
 open summer but still with the mouse over my own 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:26.880
 drive tactile 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 then I just see the active top because I'm not here in the surface right now 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930
 I did not get any damage 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.620
 Screenshot displayed which is probably displayed with them 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 it makes sense who better but if all tabs are displayed 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 would be like that, for example, goals 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.790
 Warimpex Blue Whales Fall is the one I opened twice in winter and Italy 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.570
 Firefox but do not worry about it then see I hold both instances 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.530
 and we see, even if we now always a little more RAM sums to the partly clear 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 then we are also that the iPad indeed indeed looks like Explorer 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.630
 Sender one behind it should be 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.880
 so also the Firefox despite several taz it does not have one after that 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.260
 Tourists just want to open a new tab 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.420
 and enter in the rue with his simple words from Conficker 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.940
 to be interested despite confirm 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.390
 and a penalty to hurry just after the holes are supposed to 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.480
 Point Tosca was visitors should already be enough 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.490
 In this case, only three entries remain 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.299
 Among other things, the entry Â«browser points from pop punk previous 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.760
 By default, Anabel is off putting what's running on why 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.470
 Routes double-click 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.360
 and we're up the whole thing has changed and if I'm with now 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.670
 I also see all active tabs on my mouse pointer over drivers 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.760
 The interest rates are all open tabs 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.980
 just do not stop in the beautiful 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.010
