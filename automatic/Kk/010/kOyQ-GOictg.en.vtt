RMA<00:00:13.740> from<00:00:13.980> SteelSeries<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.809> bought

RMA from SteelSeries because I bought

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990 
RMA from SteelSeries because I bought
this<00:00:16.590> headset<00:00:17.070> right<00:00:17.250> when<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> came<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I guess the first batch they sent out

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.269 
I guess the first batch they sent out
had<00:00:20.369> issues<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.539> right<00:00:21.750> side<00:00:22.250> with<00:00:23.250> the

you<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.740> quick<00:01:16.830> clip<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you a really quick clip here of what it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.749 
you a really quick clip here of what it
sounds<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:19.040> what<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.159> does<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> will

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sounds like what this does is it will

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.390 
sounds like what this does is it will
equalize<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.390> volume<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:23.310> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
equalize that volume out so even if

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.859 
equalize that volume out so even if
you're<00:01:23.520> talking<00:01:23.640> quiet<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.720> you're

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you're talking quiet or if you're

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.410 
you're talking quiet or if you're
screaming<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:26.310> everyone<00:01:26.670> else<00:01:26.850> will<00:01:27.090> hear

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
screaming what everyone else will hear

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.830 
screaming what everyone else will hear
is<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.290> same<00:01:28.560> volume<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.509> as<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.780> see

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
is the same volume and as you can see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
is the same volume and as you can see
now<00:01:31.170> there's<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.860> lot<00:01:32.009> more<00:01:32.159> bass<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:32.610> voice
