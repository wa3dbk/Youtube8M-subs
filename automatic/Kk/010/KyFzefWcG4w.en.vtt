out at about 180 for some of that could

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.100 
out at about 180 for some of that could
be<00:01:54.100> water<00:01:54.400> it's<00:01:54.729> hard<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.970> say<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.390> know<00:01:56.020> you

anything<00:02:00.409> could<00:02:00.590> be<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.950> little<00:02:01.130> bit<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.310> water

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
anything could be a little bit of water

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.520 
anything could be a little bit of water
retention<00:02:01.729> or<00:02:02.210> water<00:02:02.420> loss<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:02.990> go<00:02:03.110> add

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
retention or water loss so you go add

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.410 
retention or water loss so you go add
those<00:02:04.009> results<00:02:04.490> over<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.790> long<00:02:05.000> haul<00:02:05.240> it's

those results over the long haul it's
not<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.810> important<00:02:06.380> day<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.560> day<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.369> we'll

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
not really important day to day so we'll

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.520

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.039 
movement right so locking them in here
it's<00:03:10.310> better<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.239> can<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.510> one<00:03:11.720> arm<00:03:11.750> at<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> time

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
it's better you can do one arm at a time

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.349 
it's better you can do one arm at a time
so<00:03:12.560> when<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.799> get<00:03:12.920> tired<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.370> me<00:03:13.489> find<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.910> at

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
so when you get tired and me find it at

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.090 
so when you get tired and me find it at
the<00:03:14.540> very<00:03:14.690> end<00:03:14.840> you're<00:03:15.410> doing<00:03:15.590> one<00:03:15.799> arm<00:03:15.950> at<00:03:16.070> a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
the very end you're doing one arm at a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.400 
the very end you're doing one arm at a
time<00:03:16.160> really<00:03:17.150> focus<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.750> one<00:03:17.959> individual

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
time really focus on one individual

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.590 
time really focus on one individual
large<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.549> well<00:03:19.700> there<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.060> all<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.299> should<00:03:20.450> do

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
large so well there is all you should do

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.599 
large so well there is all you should do
two<00:03:21.109> or<00:03:21.260> three<00:03:21.290> sets<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.829> these<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.280> different

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
two or three sets of these on different

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.640 
two or three sets of these on different
levels<00:03:22.880> I'll<00:03:23.030> start<00:03:23.299> up<00:03:23.480> usually<00:03:24.230> one<00:03:24.440> level

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
levels I'll start up usually one level

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.160 
levels I'll start up usually one level
down<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.310> go<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.760> top<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.500> then<00:03:27.650> once

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
down and go up to the top and then once

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.680 
down and go up to the top and then once
I'll<00:03:28.319> take<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> quick<00:03:28.860> break<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.430> then<00:03:29.690> I'll

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
I'll take a quick break and then I'll

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.350 
I'll take a quick break and then I'll
essentially<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.770> need<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.819> do<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.120> city

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
essentially do I need to do this city

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.809 
essentially do I need to do this city
straight<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:35.569> like<00:03:36.569> this<00:03:37.310> or<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.580> kind<00:03:38.790> of

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
straight up like this or you can kind of

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.750 
straight up like this or you can kind of
lean<00:03:38.970> back<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:41.100> can<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:41.459> arm<00:03:41.490> at<00:03:41.730> a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
lean back so you can do one arm at a

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.390 
lean back so you can do one arm at a
time<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> enjoin<00:03:43.890> us<00:03:44.040> forward

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
time you can kind of enjoin us forward

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.790 
time you can kind of enjoin us forward
like<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.209> -<00:03:45.420> there's<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:45.840> many<00:03:45.900> ways<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.470> can

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
like this - there's so many ways you can

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.430 
like this - there's so many ways you can
do<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.430> I've<00:03:47.610> said<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.180> past

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
do it and like I've said in the past

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.240 
do it and like I've said in the past
sometimes<00:03:49.440> when<00:03:49.590> you're<00:03:49.740> working<00:03:50.100> around

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
sometimes when you're working around

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.940 
sometimes when you're working around
injuries<00:03:51.090> sometimes<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.410> changing<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
injuries sometimes just changing the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.490 
injuries sometimes just changing the
angle<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.370> your<00:03:53.400> arm<00:03:53.670> can<00:03:54.120> really<00:03:54.420> help<00:03:54.630> smooth

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
angle of your arm can really help smooth

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.170 
angle of your arm can really help smooth
that<00:03:55.709> out<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.040> make<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.310> easier<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.700> do<00:03:56.970> not

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
at the top of the mat and I just sort of

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.500 
at the top of the mat and I just sort of
angle<00:04:52.350> these<00:04:52.470> on<00:04:52.650> about<00:04:52.860> 45<00:04:53.360> keep<00:04:54.360> my

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
angle these on about 45 keep my

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.510 
angle these on about 45 keep my
shoulders<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.470> tight<00:04:55.770> we're<00:04:56.160> starting<00:04:56.460> my

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
shoulders in tight we're starting my

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.909 
shoulders in tight we're starting my
elbows<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.120> tight<00:04:57.470> because<00:04:58.470> this<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.800> an

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
elbows in tight because this is an

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.150

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
artifact of the art Marco then I just go

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.330 
artifact of the art Marco then I just go
a<00:05:02.490> little<00:05:02.820> bit<00:05:03.000> past<00:05:03.030> 45<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.860> then<00:05:04.950> straight

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
a little bit past 45 and then straight

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
a little bit past 45 and then straight
out<00:05:06.620> this

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
out this

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.120 
out this
for<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.389> while<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:13.330> they<00:05:13.419> get<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.600> good<00:05:13.690> burner

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
for a while so they get a good burner

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.550 
for a while so they get a good burner
you<00:05:15.130> can<00:05:15.280> also<00:05:15.660> do<00:05:16.660> this<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.050> it's<00:05:17.169> basically

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
you can also do this so it's basically

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.180 
you can also do this so it's basically
the<00:05:17.710> same<00:05:17.889> position<00:05:18.430> this<00:05:19.360> is<00:05:19.479> more<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.840> dip

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
the same position this is more of a dip

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.189 
the same position this is more of a dip
and<00:05:21.190> so<00:05:21.430> I<00:05:21.639> just<00:05:22.139> do<00:05:23.139> my<00:05:23.260> dips<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.900> again<00:05:26.110> if

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199
