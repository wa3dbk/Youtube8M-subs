area<00:03:03.670> back<00:03:03.910> there<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.570> then<00:03:05.110> here<00:03:05.860> there's<00:03:06.550> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
area back there and then here there's a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.540 
area back there and then here there's a
crease<00:03:07.000> where<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> nose<00:03:07.780> begins<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> put<00:03:09.520> a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
crease where the nose begins so I put a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.510 
crease where the nose begins so I put a
straight<00:03:09.880> line<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.370> basically

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
straight line like so this is basically

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:21.420 
straight line like so this is basically
solid<00:03:13.150> black

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.770 

then<00:03:22.430> out<00:03:23.300> on<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.870> edge<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.410> store<00:03:24.710> I<00:03:25.780> want

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
then out on the edge of the store I want

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.960 
then out on the edge of the store I want
in<00:03:27.500> play<00:03:27.770> into<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> sure<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.610> measure<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
in play into the sure to measure the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.440 
in play into the sure to measure the
face<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.450> then<00:03:29.540> blended<00:03:29.990> in<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.400> soften<00:03:32.120> it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
face and then blended in and soften it

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.260 
face and then blended in and soften it

and then the top point of the stars

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.000 
and then the top point of the stars
point<00:03:38.120> here<00:03:38.270> is<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:38.600> goes<00:03:39.050> furthest<00:03:39.530> across

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
point here is just goes furthest across

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.130 
point here is just goes furthest across

back again locking it underneath the ice
you<00:04:11.660> don't<00:04:11.840> fill<00:04:12.320> these<00:04:12.500> gaps<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.490> solid

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
you don't fill these gaps in the solid

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.460 
you don't fill these gaps in the solid
black<00:04:14.030> because<00:04:14.300> it'd<00:04:14.390> be<00:04:14.480> too<00:04:14.660> black<00:04:14.900> just

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
black because it'd be too black just

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.780 
black because it'd be too black just
feeling<00:04:15.710> nauseous<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.690> other<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.890> then

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
feeling nauseous and the other and then

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.690 
feeling nauseous and the other and then
that<00:04:20.360> gives<00:04:20.570> us<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:21.110> good<00:04:21.680> 50<00:04:22.070> jump<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:22.430> year

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
that gives us a good 50 jump this year

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.580 
that gives us a good 50 jump this year
and<00:04:23.350> then<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.740> final<00:04:24.950> two<00:04:25.490> stages<00:04:26.590> are

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
and then the final two stages are

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.650 
and then the final two stages are
drawing<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.010> line<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.640> the<00:04:28.760> gap<00:04:28.910> between<00:04:29.060> the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
drawing the line in the gap between the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.620 
drawing the line in the gap between the
lips<00:04:30.250> which<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:32.180> side<00:04:32.390> of<00:04:32.540> going<00:04:32.780> astray

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.950 

you<00:04:37.380> kind<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.740> move<00:04:37.890> at<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.130> top<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.580> lip

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
you kind of move at the top of the lip

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.660 
you kind of move at the top of the lip
but<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.410> don't<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.740> don't<00:04:41.010> make<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.430> extreme

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
but you don't you don't make it extreme

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.820 
but you don't you don't make it extreme
you<00:04:42.180> don't<00:04:42.360> put<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.570> dip<00:04:43.350> in<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.620> middle

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
you don't put that dip in the middle

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.930 
you don't put that dip in the middle
there<00:04:43.980> then<00:04:44.550> put<00:04:44.790> another<00:04:45.000> line<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:47.400> one<00:04:47.730> with

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
there then put another line on one with

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.970 
there then put another line on one with
a<00:04:47.970> lip<00:04:48.180> right<00:04:48.890> also<00:04:49.890> put<00:04:50.130> here<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.760> put<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.060> shadow

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.140 

gives<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.130> form<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.580> then<00:04:56.640> out<00:04:56.790> for<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:57.000> little

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
gives it form and then out for a little

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.020 
gives it form and then out for a little
bit<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.420> shadow<00:04:57.750> soft<00:04:58.260> shadows<00:04:58.770> oh<00:04:58.950> yeah<00:04:59.130> so

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
bit of shadow soft shadows oh yeah so

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.150 
bit of shadow soft shadows oh yeah so
before<00:05:00.210> I'll<00:05:00.570> put<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.900> red<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.320> I've<00:05:01.920> already

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
before I'll put the red on I've already

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.010 
before I'll put the red on I've already
given<00:05:02.550> its<00:05:02.820> structure<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.450> that<00:05:03.690> helps<00:05:03.960> me

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
given its structure and that helps me

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.820 
given its structure and that helps me
define<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:05.810> like<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.290> then<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.680> final

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
define it like so and then the final

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.530 
define it like so and then the final
thing<00:05:10.190> let's<00:05:11.190> write<00:05:11.670> the<00:05:11.820> outline<00:05:11.940> of<00:05:12.150> Graham

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
thing let's write the outline of Graham

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.750 
thing let's write the outline of Graham
the<00:05:13.440> drill<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:19.100> ok<00:05:20.100> when<00:05:20.340> you<00:05:20.430> get<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.640> this

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
the drill I ok when you get to this

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.670 
the drill I ok when you get to this
point<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:21.570> also<00:05:21.690> most<00:05:21.990> interesting<00:05:22.590> because

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
point it's also most interesting because

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.830 
point it's also most interesting because
it's<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.040> reveal<00:05:23.400> so<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:23.940> take<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.180> stencil

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
it's the reveal so you take the stencil

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.060 
it's the reveal so you take the stencil
away<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.920> gives<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.250> just<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.700> key<00:05:26.970> areas

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
away and it gives you just the key areas

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.580 
away and it gives you just the key areas
like<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:29.790> again<00:05:30.600> logged<00:05:30.900> it<00:05:31.110> on<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.320> gene

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
like so so again logged it on the gene

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.410 
like so so again logged it on the gene
and<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.890> ice<00:05:32.010> t<00:05:32.310> shirts<00:05:32.610> we've<00:05:33.000> got<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.210> fill

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
and the ice t shirts we've got to fill

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.050 
and the ice t shirts we've got to fill
in<00:05:33.540> these<00:05:33.690> restrictions<00:05:34.560> where<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.490> stencil

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
in these restrictions where the stencil

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.110 
in these restrictions where the stencil
was<00:05:36.210> left<00:05:36.480> egg<00:05:37.260> yeah<00:05:37.530> so<00:05:38.130> here<00:05:38.430> it's<00:05:38.850> just<00:05:38.940> a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
was left egg yeah so here it's just a

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.890 
was left egg yeah so here it's just a
simple<00:05:39.540> case<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:41.360> doing<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.480> kind<00:05:42.720> of<00:05:42.900> line

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
simple case of doing that kind of line

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.310 
simple case of doing that kind of line
we<00:05:45.900> spin<00:05:46.200> up<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.350> bottom<00:05:46.820> and<00:05:47.820> then<00:05:48.420> here

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
we spin up the bottom and then here

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.630 
we spin up the bottom and then here
filling<00:05:50.100> in<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.310> gaps<00:05:51.200> now<00:05:52.200> here<00:05:52.490> you've<00:05:53.490> got

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
filling in the gaps now here you've got

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.110 
filling in the gaps now here you've got
to<00:05:53.730> draw<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.880> corner<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.540> eye<00:05:54.570> like<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:56.120> do

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
to draw the corner of the eye like so do

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.360 
to draw the corner of the eye like so do
you<00:05:57.330> keep<00:05:57.510> doing<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:57.900> tyra<00:05:58.350> show<00:05:58.470> yeah<00:05:59.190> and

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
you keep doing that tyra show yeah and

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.570 
you keep doing that tyra show yeah and
then<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.610> filled<00:05:59.820> again<00:06:01.010> solid<00:06:02.010> black<00:06:04.250> now<00:06:05.250> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
then it filled again solid black now the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.660 
then it filled again solid black now the
next<00:06:05.610> bit<00:06:06.170> you'll<00:06:07.170> notice<00:06:07.590> there's<00:06:07.920> no<00:06:08.070> I<00:06:08.340> I'll

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
next bit you'll notice there's no I I'll

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.670 
next bit you'll notice there's no I I'll
lead<00:06:09.360> so<00:06:09.630> you<00:06:09.720> have<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:09.990> draw<00:06:10.170> that<00:06:10.200> in<00:06:10.530> because

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
lead so you have to draw that in because

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.830 
lead so you have to draw that in because
we've<00:06:11.040> got<00:06:11.160> most<00:06:11.370> of<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:11.640> are<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.570> iris

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
we've got most of the I are the iris

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.290 
we've got most of the I are the iris
expose<00:06:13.230> we<00:06:13.560> need<00:06:13.830> to<00:06:14.400> knock<00:06:14.580> out<00:06:14.760> the<00:06:15.000> sort<00:06:15.240> of

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
expose we need to knock out the sort of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.260 
expose we need to knock out the sort of
top<00:06:15.980> fifteen<00:06:16.980> to<00:06:17.130> twenty<00:06:17.370> percent<00:06:17.640> like<00:06:17.910> syrup

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
top fifteen to twenty percent like syrup

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.200 
top fifteen to twenty percent like syrup
so<00:06:18.830> make<00:06:19.830> sure<00:06:19.860> you<00:06:20.040> got<00:06:20.130> a<00:06:20.280> clean<00:06:20.580> tip<00:06:21.030> on<00:06:21.180> the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
so make sure you got a clean tip on the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.930 
so make sure you got a clean tip on the
airbrush<00:06:21.600> and<00:06:22.230> drawing<00:06:23.010> a<00:06:23.130> line<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.550> this<00:06:23.700> kind

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
airbrush and drawing a line of this kind
