00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.480
 the quality of construction and style 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.100
 design professional makes dj t one 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.500
 that suits the djs better than 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.300
 They want to use a tractor, we asked the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.490
 Spanish legend of techno the dj and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.110
 artist christian varela to know 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.700
 how this product behaves with the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.370
 existing teams in the clubs 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.610
 I usually always use two cdj 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.400
 2000 that of jm 2000 and always the dishes 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.530
 technicians for the gold tract for vinyl 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.330
 We generally use it for all 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.760
 the djs that are in our agency or 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.800
 our jockeys friends too 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.500
 international so they can try 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.260
 the new pioneer tables or the new ones 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.510
 t of j 2000 because basically the team 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.540
 what we have in the studio is a plate 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.250
 techniques a cdj 1001 cdj 2000 and by 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.990
 course of jm 2000 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.880
 We work with a tractor to integrate 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.500
 appearance of the software but maintaining 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.870
 the characteristics and design of 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.210
 pioneer if it shows that you are using 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.280
 a product of pioneer because it has the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.620
 same technology the same components 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.600
 and you feel like home is like a 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.430
 more product of pioneer I think it's a 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.200
 product that is very well organized 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.060
 because you have everything together but it's 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.540
 very well determined where they have the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.290
 effects are not the table is all very 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.409
 well organized 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.909
 the dj t1 is not just a great hardware 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.290
 It is also your gateway to the 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.570
 use of professional equipment 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.729
 for the club I think it's very important 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.040
 that the team that uses the people that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.870
 then he will dedicate himself professionally 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.490
 be as close as possible to what 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.740
 then they will find themselves in a cabin 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.960
 professional because I especially 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.119
 I recommend this product for people 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.920
 who wants to start at home and then 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.600
 dedicate to professionally DJing 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 all other controllers of the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.530
 market includes in the basic tractor l 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.500
 that you have to update the software 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.569
 however the dj t 1 includes the tractor 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.950
 pioneer edition that allows you to use the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.709
 typical functions of this software 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.720
 recording 4 channels and 6 units of 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.340
 effects I think the controller 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.049
 pioneer what you have is that you can 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.180
 click with four plates you can 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.459
 use a lot of effects and the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.230
 leaf controllers what they have are 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.049
 everything very basic you only use two 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.750
 channels you can not use almost effects 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.129
 I think it's a step above 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.750
 talking about effects this is one of the 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.700
 tractor strengths and we have 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.260
 included the most popular effects that 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.720
 can be linked and used in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.239
 creative combinations usually I 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.519
 like to use in the chain of effects 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.590
 for example the filter to then go 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.420
 giving him the river and then a delay you're going 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.750
 making everything grow and then when 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.549
 you take everything back and it's perfect because I 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.129
 also like the combination of beat 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.200
 master with the noise door and with the 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.150
 flyer because you can go pick up the flyer 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.190
 taking it with the beat master and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.989
 doing the stretch and then you can go 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.350
 combining it with the noise door with 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.150
 which is a kind of loop 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.950
 well what I want to do is a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.380
 demonstration of how to use all 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 effects in a single performance in the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.830
 which you are getting a more effect 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.330
 adding adding until you finish 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.330
 using all effects 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.910
 the video has no balanced connections 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.920
 drs to connect the pea teams and 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.560
 another air outlet to connect the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.210
 good dj monitors i think that is what 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.190
 easier because you only have to 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.710
 take the controller and you can 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.780
 Take a party to your home or even 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.790
 have a party anywhere 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.410
 I think it's a controller that 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.720
 You can use for all styles 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.850
 in general but I see it more focused 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.010
 towards techno the house the tech house or 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.900
 the mini mate the teo does not have a 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.670
 space to locate the keyboard of the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.320
 portable and through the controls 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.780
 you can browse through your folders 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.160
 library and the laptop's screen 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.110
 becomes an extension of his 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.560
 controller located in the center of the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.990
 scene 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.610
 returning to the effects you can use 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.830
 the typical looking functions of 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.840
 pioneer or edit them in tractor style 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.280
 with the auto loops good what I'm going to 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.000
 to do is a demonstration of how 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.440
 use the auto loop and how can you go 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.510
 narrowing the amount of beats in the 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.669
 loop until you get to a very 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.590
 small and then use the filter and the 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.590
 review to see how everything works together 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.740
 part of the auto loops there is one thing that 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:52.719
 It's very good that you can move the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.209
 look inside the track and at the same time be able to 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:58.020
 Narrow it and move it at the same time 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:58.020
 which is spectacular 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.240
 the needle mode search function 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.520
 gives direct access to any point of 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.960
 the track and pressing on function 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.879
 we can configure controls 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.889
 Additional tractor as 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.990
 important of the new technology is that 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.599
 you can combine the controllers the t 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.869
 of jacks and everything makes it like a 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.139
 kind of performance and much more that 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.139
 one 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.160
 yes 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.830
 yes 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.770
 the leader 1 matches the interface 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.990
 of tractor like no other controller 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.940
 it's like you're using a computer 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.130
 of villarreal because it is built with 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.130
 the same mechanics as our and dj's and 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:43.040
 dj james offering an operability and 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.290
 excellent durability good I think that 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.810
 neither is it a very expensive product because 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.340
 actually with that product with the 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.320
 pioneer controller you have 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.510
 absolutely everything you need in 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.970
 a cabin the table the dishes 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.450
 effects and you save a lot of money not 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.450
 stagnant
