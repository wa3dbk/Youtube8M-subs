riding the same bike as they do all week
oh<00:01:39.009> yeah<00:01:39.850> these<00:01:40.030> basically<00:01:40.509> on<00:01:40.780> these<00:01:40.959> Civello

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
oh yeah these basically on these Civello

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.279 
oh yeah these basically on these Civello
are<00:01:41.679> three<00:01:41.920> this<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.310> real<00:01:42.549> or<00:01:42.729> three<00:01:42.999> mud

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
are three this is real or three mud

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.050 
are three this is real or three mud
which<00:01:44.289> is<00:01:44.499> initially<00:01:45.310> developed<00:01:45.729> for<00:01:45.789> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
which is initially developed for the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.499 
which is initially developed for the
pair<00:01:46.899> Roubaix<00:01:47.459> we<00:01:48.459> find<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.939> very<00:01:48.969> good<00:01:49.299> bike

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
pair Roubaix we find it a very good bike

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.319 
pair Roubaix we find it a very good bike
for<00:01:49.779> the<00:01:49.840> rest<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.259> cobblestone<00:01:50.829> races<00:01:51.399> if

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
for the rest of the cobblestone races if

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.370 
for the rest of the cobblestone races if
ideally<00:01:52.899> suited<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:54.569> good<00:01:55.569> old-fashioned
