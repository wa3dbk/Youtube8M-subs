interpretation let's dive right into
this<00:00:58.040> first<00:00:58.309> part<00:00:59.199> it's<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.290> very<00:01:00.500> kind<00:01:00.800> of

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
this first part it's a very kind of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.500 
this first part it's a very kind of
strange<00:01:01.280> opening<00:01:01.820> if<00:01:01.909> you<00:01:02.000> think<00:01:02.210> about<00:01:02.360> it

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
strange opening if you think about it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.830 
strange opening if you think about it
because<00:01:04.269> immediately<00:01:05.269> we're<00:01:05.720> in<00:01:05.810> D<00:01:06.020> major<00:01:07.840> we

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
because immediately we're in D major we

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.990 
because immediately we're in D major we
keep<00:01:09.080> going

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.990 

rather<00:01:18.000> than<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.660> resolving<00:01:19.640> there<00:01:20.640> we

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
rather than you know resolving there we

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
rather than you know resolving there we
keep<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:23.720> we<00:01:24.720> keep<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:25.230> these

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
keep going we keep going to these

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530 
keep going we keep going to these
strange<00:01:25.740> keys<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.730> I'm<00:01:26.850> trying<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> get

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
strange keys so what I'm trying to get

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
strange keys so what I'm trying to get
at<00:01:27.690> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.620> fact<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.490> creates

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
at is the fact that this creates

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
at is the fact that this creates
momentum<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.660> creates<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
momentum it creates a little bit of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.680 
momentum it creates a little bit of
tension<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.760> through<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:38.480> it's<00:01:39.480> kind

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
tension as you go through so it's kind

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.840 
tension as you go through so it's kind
of<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.870> putting<00:01:40.290> off<00:01:40.700> gratification<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of like putting off gratification of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.820 
of like putting off gratification of
some<00:01:42.090> sort<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.780> we're<00:01:43.050> not<00:01:43.200> resolving

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
some sort you know we're not resolving

00:01:43.830 --> 00:02:00.860 
some sort you know we're not resolving

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
keys and you're just kind of sloshing

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.949 
keys and you're just kind of sloshing
around<00:03:51.080> you<00:03:52.080> know<00:03:52.200> creating<00:03:52.770> something

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
around you know creating something

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.360 
around you know creating something
fingertips<00:03:54.959> are<00:03:55.170> not<00:03:55.410> really<00:03:55.680> necessary<00:03:56.220> you

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
fingertips are not really necessary you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.130 
fingertips are not really necessary you
want<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> little<00:03:57.030> flatter<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.600> just

stroking

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.960 

if<00:04:21.020> you<00:04:21.260> are<00:04:21.380> comparing<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.430> if<00:04:22.730> you<00:04:22.850> were

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
if you are comparing this to if you were

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.630 
if you are comparing this to if you were
likening<00:04:23.540> this<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.930> water<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:25.220> left<00:04:25.400> hand

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
likening this to water the left hand

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.150 
likening this to water the left hand
would<00:04:25.790> just<00:04:25.970> be<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> small<00:04:26.800> slowly<00:04:27.800> moving

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
would just be the small slowly moving

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.130 
would just be the small slowly moving
stream<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.300> right<00:04:29.450> hand<00:04:29.630> might<00:04:29.780> be<00:04:29.930> kind

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
stream and the right hand might be kind

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.870 
stream and the right hand might be kind
of<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.320> bigger<00:04:30.500> river<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.100> know<00:04:31.220> going<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:31.730> and

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
of a bigger river you know going in and

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.850 
of a bigger river you know going in and
out<00:04:32.000> more<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.600> have<00:04:32.900> more<00:04:32.930> contour<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:33.770> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
out more you have more contour in the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.980 
out more you have more contour in the
right<00:04:34.040> hand<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.880> left<00:04:35.030> hand<00:04:35.300> just<00:04:35.360> stays

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
right hand and the left hand just stays

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.050 
right hand and the left hand just stays
soft<00:04:36.350> underneath<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:37.190> can<00:04:37.460> come<00:04:37.670> up<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.940> little

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
soft underneath it can come up a little

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.670 
soft underneath it can come up a little
bit<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.480> support<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.900> right<00:04:39.050> hand<00:04:39.260> but<00:04:39.590> it

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
bit to support the right hand but it

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.020 
bit to support the right hand but it
never<00:04:39.830> wants<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.160> come<00:04:40.370> all<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.700> way<00:04:40.730> up<00:04:40.820> to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
never wants to come all the way up to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.010 
never wants to come all the way up to
the<00:04:41.120> right<00:04:41.270> hand<00:04:41.450> because<00:04:41.570> then<00:04:41.870> it's

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
the right hand because then it's

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.080 
the right hand because then it's
competing<00:04:42.530> for<00:04:42.740> attention<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.730> simply

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
competing for attention and you simply

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.640 
competing for attention and you simply
just<00:04:44.240> don't<00:04:44.450> want<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:44.810> all<00:04:45.230> right<00:04:45.380> here<00:04:45.560> we

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
just don't want that all right here we

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.540 
just don't want that all right here we
go<00:04:48.070> just<00:04:49.070> going<00:04:49.370> nice<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.760> slow<00:04:49.970> just

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
go just going nice and slow just

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:01.090 
go just going nice and slow just
focusing<00:04:52.550> on<00:04:52.640> voicing<00:04:59.080> okay<00:05:00.080> now<00:05:00.680> let's<00:05:00.920> think

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
focusing on voicing okay now let's think

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.620 
focusing on voicing okay now let's think
about<00:05:01.220> this

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.170 

that's<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.840> one<00:05:11.440> really<00:05:11.830> long<00:05:12.040> phrase<00:05:15.180> with

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
that's like one really long phrase with

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:25.680 
that's like one really long phrase with
little<00:05:16.540> intros<00:05:17.140> into<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:24.390> one<00:05:25.390> really

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
little intros into it one really

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.360 
little intros into it one really
brilliant<00:05:26.140> thing<00:05:26.320> that<00:05:26.440> my<00:05:26.560> my<00:05:26.920> teacher<00:05:27.160> in

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
brilliant thing that my my teacher in

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.700 
brilliant thing that my my teacher in
Michigan<00:05:27.790> and<00:05:27.910> I<00:05:28.000> went<00:05:28.210> over<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:28.660> he<00:05:29.500> taught

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
Michigan and I went over that he taught

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.550 
Michigan and I went over that he taught
me<00:05:29.920> is<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.520> think<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.360> these<00:05:31.540> in<00:05:31.840> different

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
me is to think of these in different

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.280 
me is to think of these in different
time<00:05:33.280> signatures<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:34.690> this<00:05:34.870> first<00:05:35.110> little

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
time signatures so this first little

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.090 
time signatures so this first little
phrase<00:05:35.500> is<00:05:35.680> just<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.920> little<00:05:36.130> upbeat<00:05:36.990> one<00:05:38.100> two

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
phrase is just a little upbeat one two

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.480 
phrase is just a little upbeat one two
and<00:05:39.670> three<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.750> ok<00:05:41.650> now<00:05:41.680> this<00:05:41.890> so<00:05:42.250> that's<00:05:42.400> a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
and three and ok now this so that's a

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.340 
and three and ok now this so that's a
bar<00:05:42.640> of<00:05:42.730> three<00:05:42.940> for<00:05:43.180> now<00:05:43.630> this<00:05:43.720> is<00:05:43.780> a<00:05:43.900> bar<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.170> 2

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
bar of three for now this is a bar of 2
