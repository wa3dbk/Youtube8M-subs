 upper.ru if there are such large firms 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.719

 for example iphone its features 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.470
 endless but only if 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 know how to pump it that is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.840

 weak spot of whatever 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 smartphone is a battery 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 Of course the abundance of operations we perform them. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 this complex device requires 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.309
 a lot of energy so we 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.180
 set out to make an iphone 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.610
 energy saving and find out what 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 still spending energy and found 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 application battery life 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 interface of this useful program 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 reminds race 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.449
 neon diagrams accurately display on 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 what and how battery backup is spent 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.420
 clicking on the button in the right corner from the bottom you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.030
 find useful recommendations by applying 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.549
 which battery will live longer 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.290
 the bottom graph shows you what and 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.950
 how much can you do with such 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.540
 charge level here as a smartphone 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.729
 maintained on 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.890
 lying somewhere aside 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.130
 you visually show how 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.579
 the battery is charged then the graph goes with 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.119
 in numbers how long can you listen to music 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.180
 see for yourself 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.750
 The program interface is intuitive and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.509
 is simple 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 Now let's talk about the memory as if it were not 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.460
 there was a lot anyway one day maybe 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 need more than help all 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.310
 just install the famous dropbox and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.170
 he miraculously expanded memory 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.630
 your device you can 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 use 2 gig cloud 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.430
 the spaces are absolutely free 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.810
 and then use them through other 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.970
 devices from 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.399
 full cloud application in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.570
 which can not only be stored 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.250
 all sorts of documents but also 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.039
 edit them right there 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.950
 the program has a rich functionality 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.080
 for example, you can see your story

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.819
 folders with information for others 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.920
 users of the service but most importantly 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.349
 access this information is not 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.200
 only from your iphone but from others 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.180
 devices you think that with a mobile 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.660
 bills painfully often withdraw money 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.160
 maybe the thing is that you do not know how 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.090
 control the consumption of information and 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.069
 no wonder 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.870
 you will not calculate how many times 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.980
 went to the internet using a smartphone 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.680
 3g 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.030

 we see several tiles on each of 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.819
 which is the name of the function for which it is 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.609
