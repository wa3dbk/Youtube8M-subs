because<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> goes<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:21.119> faster<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> get

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
because it goes a lot faster and you get

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.410 
because it goes a lot faster and you get
a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.890> more<00:01:23.189> money<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> significant

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a lot more money like a significant

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090 
a lot more money like a significant
amount<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.930> money<00:01:25.170> um<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.979> gonna

this is a really great way at the
beginning<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> game<00:02:39.390> obviously<00:02:40.020> I'm

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
beginning of the game obviously I'm

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.900 
beginning of the game obviously I'm
assuming<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.770> every<00:02:41.100> game<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.460> know<00:02:41.580> once

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.190 
assuming like every game you know once
you<00:02:41.970> get<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.330> end<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.720> sort<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.990> have

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you get to the end you sort of have

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.740 
you get to the end you sort of have
everything<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.800> don't<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.150> need<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.570> buy

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
everything you don't really need to buy

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.090 
everything you don't really need to buy
stuff<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> ton<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.830> money

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
stuff because you have a ton of money

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.610 
stuff because you have a ton of money
but<00:02:47.730> because<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> free<00:02:49.020> roam<00:02:49.200> game<00:02:49.230> if

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
but because this is a free roam game if

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.990 
but because this is a free roam game if
you<00:02:49.740> want<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.370> mess<00:02:50.550> around<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
you want to just mess around with that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.310 
you want to just mess around with that
the<00:02:51.210> beginning<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> game<00:02:51.810> not<00:02:52.080> really

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
the beginning of the game not really

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.650 
the beginning of the game not really
progression<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> story<00:02:53.700> until<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.270> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
perfect way to do it and one thing I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.070 
perfect way to do it and one thing I
would<00:03:01.980> suggest<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.640> at<00:03:03.180> least<00:03:03.600> for<00:03:03.840> me<00:03:03.960> it

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
would suggest now at least for me it

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.660 
would suggest now at least for me it
seems<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.860> just<00:03:04.890> got<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.430> find

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
seems like you just got to go find

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.500 
seems like you just got to go find
places<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.780> um<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> city<00:03:09.150> at<00:03:09.330> least

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
places that um like in the city at least

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.050 
places that um like in the city at least
like<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.560> look<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.550> they<00:03:11.730> would<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:11.910> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
like that look like they would have a
