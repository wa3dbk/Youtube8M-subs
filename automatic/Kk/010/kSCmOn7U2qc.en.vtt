00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
Australia and it's also highly venomous

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.210 
Australia and it's also highly venomous
now<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:00.500> kind<00:01:00.770> of<00:01:00.860> guy<00:01:01.720> has<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:03.320> most<00:01:03.500> toxins

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
now this kind of guy has the most toxins

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.570 
now this kind of guy has the most toxins
per<00:01:04.730> bite<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.270> any<00:01:05.660> snake<00:01:06.050> in<00:01:06.320> Australia<00:01:07.160> and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
per bite of any snake in Australia and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.690 
per bite of any snake in Australia and
if<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:08.030> were<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.180> get<00:01:08.330> bitten<00:01:08.570> by<00:01:08.810> him<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:10.520> all

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
if I were to get bitten by him in all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.550 
if I were to get bitten by him in all
likelihood<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.450> could<00:01:11.630> lose<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.810> limb<00:01:12.170> because

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
likelihood I could lose a limb because

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.310 
likelihood I could lose a limb because
the<00:01:12.860> neurotoxins<00:01:13.700> they<00:01:13.820> release<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:15.050> also

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
the neurotoxins they release they also

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.350 
the neurotoxins they release they also
prey<00:01:15.590> upon<00:01:15.890> other<00:01:16.190> snakes<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.120> they're

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
prey upon other snakes and they're

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.390 
prey upon other snakes and they're
immune<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.990> bites<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.440> other<00:01:18.590> snakes<00:01:18.979> so

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
immune to the bites of other snakes so

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.070 
immune to the bites of other snakes so
it<00:01:19.520> makes<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:19.940> guy<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.420> highly<00:01:23.080> competitive

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
it makes this guy a highly competitive

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.390 
it makes this guy a highly competitive
guy<00:01:24.440> just<00:01:24.740> want<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.920> see<00:01:25.010> if<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.220> get<00:01:25.310> an
