00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
basically the fish have been eating

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
basically the fish have been eating
everything<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.489> that's<00:00:59.910> been<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
everything so that's been kind of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.779 
everything so that's been kind of
unfortunate<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.739> also<00:01:01.920> know<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.699> have

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
unfortunate and I also know I don't have

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.780 
unfortunate and I also know I don't have
enough<00:01:02.940> carbon<00:01:03.270> dioxide<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> tank<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
enough carbon dioxide in the tank so

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.170 
enough carbon dioxide in the tank so
that<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> negative<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.100> anyway<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that is kind of a negative but anyway so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.730 
that is kind of a negative but anyway so
I<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> haven't<00:01:10.110> done<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> video<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.680> a

originally had him in a 1.5 gallon tank
but<00:03:06.850> i<00:03:07.090> quickly<00:03:07.150> realized<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.829> was<00:03:09.130> not

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280

but i quickly realized that that was not
gonna<00:03:09.459> work<00:03:09.609> out<00:03:09.790> i<00:03:09.819> didn't<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.299> heater<00:03:10.569> in

it<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> basically<00:03:11.769> thought<00:03:12.130> he<00:03:12.220> was<00:03:12.340> dying

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
at a more constant temperature than the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.740 
at a more constant temperature than the
small<00:03:32.290> 1.5<00:03:32.859> gallon<00:03:33.160> tank<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:34.090> he<00:03:34.419> did<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.630> lot

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
I've got like the new fixtures for the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.870 
I've got like the new fixtures for the
filter<00:03:56.110> they're<00:03:56.380> not<00:03:56.590> black<00:03:57.190> anymore<00:03:57.400> they

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
filter they're not black anymore they

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.860 
filter they're not black anymore they
kind<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.090> look<00:03:58.209> really<00:03:58.390> gross<00:03:58.540> right<00:03:58.720> now

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
kind of look really gross right now

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.540 
kind of look really gross right now
because<00:03:59.050> they've<00:03:59.170> aljalja<00:03:59.560> room<00:03:59.830> but<00:04:00.340> there's

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
because they've aljalja room but there's

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.000 
because they've aljalja room but there's
that<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.239> then<00:04:01.360> there's<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:02.020> on<00:04:02.200> output

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
that one and then there's the on output

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.220 
that one and then there's the on output
right<00:04:03.190> there<00:04:03.459> which<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.180> actually<00:04:04.569> from<00:04:05.020> my

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
right there which is actually from my

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.710 
right there which is actually from my
new<00:04:05.470> filter<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.550> still<00:04:06.790> flew<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.450> still

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
new filter it's still flew it's still

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.720 
new filter it's still flew it's still
fluval<00:04:08.140> excuse<00:04:08.560> me<00:04:08.709> but<00:04:09.370> it's<00:04:09.519> actually

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
fluval excuse me but it's actually

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.690 
fluval excuse me but it's actually
instead<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.360> being<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.810> 305<00:04:11.410> version<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.099> got

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
instead of being the 305 version I got

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.259 
instead of being the 305 version I got
the<00:04:13.120> new<00:04:13.390> series<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.620> 06<00:04:15.069> series<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.700> I

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
the new series so the 06 series and I

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.080 
the new series so the 06 series and I
got<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.950> one<00:04:17.950> model<00:04:18.310> higher<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:18.820> got<00:04:19.000> the

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
got the one model higher so I got the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.680 
got the one model higher so I got the
406<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.470> basically<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:21.510> next<00:04:22.510> best

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
406 so it's basically the next best

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.530 
406 so it's basically the next best
filter<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.260> like<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.500> F<00:04:24.030> fx5<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.060> think<00:04:25.450> it's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
filter to like to F fx5 I think it's

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.719 
filter to like to F fx5 I think it's
called<00:04:25.720> which<00:04:26.380> is<00:04:26.560> like<00:04:26.710> massive<00:04:27.190> it's<00:04:27.610> like

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
called which is like massive it's like

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.200 
called which is like massive it's like
for<00:04:27.910> 500<00:04:28.330> gallons<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:28.720> i'm<00:04:29.169> pretty<00:04:29.320> sure<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
for 500 gallons but i'm pretty sure the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.409 
for 500 gallons but i'm pretty sure the
the<00:04:31.380> 305<00:04:32.380> was<00:04:32.680> rated<00:04:33.040> for<00:04:33.220> 80<00:04:33.490> gallons<00:04:34.030> and

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
the 305 was rated for 80 gallons and

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.960 
the 305 was rated for 80 gallons and
this<00:04:35.169> one's<00:04:35.410> rated<00:04:35.830> for<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.220> hundred<00:04:36.520> i

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
this one's rated for like a hundred i

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.290 
this one's rated for like a hundred i
think<00:04:37.440> 120<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.520> definitely<00:04:39.880> enough<00:04:40.120> for

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
think 120 so it's definitely enough for

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.629 
think 120 so it's definitely enough for
my<00:04:40.389> aquarium<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.080> definitely<00:04:41.530> needed<00:04:41.889> the

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
my aquarium but I definitely needed the

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.270 
my aquarium but I definitely needed the
filter<00:04:43.030> upgrade<00:04:43.419> I<00:04:43.690> had<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.680> other<00:04:44.830> filter

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
filter upgrade I had that other filter

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.240 
filter upgrade I had that other filter
for<00:04:45.550> about<00:04:45.669> three<00:04:45.970> years<00:04:46.650> yeah<00:04:47.650> I'd<00:04:47.770> used<00:04:48.070> it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
for about three years yeah I'd used it

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.770 
for about three years yeah I'd used it
for<00:04:48.400> three<00:04:48.550> years<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:48.820> just<00:04:48.970> got<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.540> new

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
for three years I just got this new

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.930 
for three years I just got this new
filter<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.620> past<00:04:50.950> summer<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.700> light<00:04:51.910> is

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
you look down here yeah they're just

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.130 
you look down here yeah they're just
like<00:05:11.530> food<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:11.919> stuff<00:05:12.220> but<00:05:12.940> uh<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:15.400> arm

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
like food and stuff but uh it's the arm

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.320 
like food and stuff but uh it's the arm
yeah<00:05:17.140> 4061<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:18.520> can't<00:05:18.729> really<00:05:18.850> see<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.150> right

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
yeah 4061 you can't really see it right

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.969 
yeah 4061 you can't really see it right
now<00:05:19.360> i'll<00:05:19.660> probably<00:05:19.930> do<00:05:20.229> an<00:05:20.380> update<00:05:20.650> video<00:05:20.800> on

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
now i'll probably do an update video on

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.250 
now i'll probably do an update video on
that<00:05:21.039> but<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.270> if<00:05:22.450> you<00:05:22.600> notice<00:05:22.900> it's

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
that but you can if you notice it's

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.930 
that but you can if you notice it's
still<00:05:23.500> in<00:05:23.590> its<00:05:23.650> bucket<00:05:24.100> but<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.729> one's

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
still in its bucket but it so this one's

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.190 
still in its bucket but it so this one's
a<00:05:25.030> lot<00:05:25.240> taller<00:05:25.570> then<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:27.090> 305<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.479> think<00:05:29.110> the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
a lot taller then the 305 I think the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.810 
a lot taller then the 305 I think the
dimensions<00:05:29.740> across<00:05:30.010> this<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.370> top<00:05:30.580> or<00:05:30.760> the

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
dimensions across this to the top or the

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.240 
dimensions across this to the top or the
same<00:05:31.060> it's<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:32.050> new<00:05:32.260> version<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:33.039> has<00:05:33.070> a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
same it's just the new version it has a

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.460 
same it's just the new version it has a
stronger<00:05:33.669> motor<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:34.510> it's<00:05:34.690> like<00:05:34.750> up<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.289> ten

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
stronger motor so it's like up to ten

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.900 
stronger motor so it's like up to ten
percent<00:05:35.830> more<00:05:36.039> output<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.639> then<00:05:37.240> it's<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:38.500> on

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
percent more output and then it's the on

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.400 
percent more output and then it's the on
