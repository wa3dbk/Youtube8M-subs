00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.509
 Servus people your brothers once again 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.300
 here we come to the second league 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.309
 Duel in the dfb cup between the vfl 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.470
 bochum and tsv 1860 munich im 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.920
 rewirpower stadium in bochum im 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.810
 Eighth finals of the dfb cup 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.439
 Referee will be the world 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.070
 Referee from Wiesbaden would say 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.160
 Let's get to the setting up and to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 team from vfl bochum 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:41.790
 yes good bochum will have been in the effect 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.340
 defense rothenbach maltritz the one yes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:51.600
 even from the bundesliga knows then 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.989
 the right-back made the company 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.120
 a 4-4-2 in midfield with bike ride with 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.010
 ten man, yes, still knows dabrowski 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.170
 everyone should be a name and goretzka 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.510
 in the storm then dedic and aydin together 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.210
 again in the storm, it should be no 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 Changes give the last played 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.310
 where does it have me somewhere if that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.250
 bochumer convinced and super g 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.630
 then it was also able to win 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.150
 give a little air the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.229
 table cellar of the second league man 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.920
 I would say we look at our 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.549
 sixty have more to 60 do not exist 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 much to say of course in the storm in the gate 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.810
 before that in the defense if Schindler's office 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 and thomas on then the old bierofka 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 which is back together with 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.799
 wannenwetsch stoppelkamp and then in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.340
 alpha in midfield daniel halfar the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.920
 typical stoppelkamp yes two meticulous 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.840
 and faster players in the water 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 can move midfield 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 of course in the storm benny lauth too 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.119
 called the phantom because he always has one 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:16.560
 right place is indeed in the last 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:23.819
 The 860 was also convincing 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 when out at dynamo dresden where you 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.510
 home against dynamo dresden where they still 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.580
 could reach one to one in total 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.849
 to say the last three games here 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.209
 out of 68 all three velvet decided before that 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.849
 they are paderborn against sc now so 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.380
 slowly out at the top not too much 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.220
 sign up at the climb would 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.160
 I say 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.760
 the last round quite sovereign at 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.709
 gross outsider berliner ak 07 13 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.120
 won though berlin kaya before in 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.840
 the first round as probably all 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.879
 know hoffheim fulminanten 4 0 out 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.430
 domestic stadium could shoot down 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.930
 but in this round they had about 60 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.560
 not to throw 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.650
 I'm curious how it is 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.819
 then tonight will play in 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.739
 Bochum 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.130
 what else is there to drill to say 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.630
 you then also matze for the bookings 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.599
 There is not much to say 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.090
 have also in the previous round three 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.730
 were tied to one against worked 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.370
 but could lay individually behind 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.540
 the game still turn yes last 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.620
 won against paderborn 14 0 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.380
 with a double sick sick good game 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.130
 the bokemeyer this season is not so 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.370
 successful he down so far 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:52.079
 Contrary to the 60 he rises to 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:56.959
 want to be then also the tip 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:59.459
 comes and will say that the castle 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.090
 are a bit inferior though they are 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.359
 could win in the last game 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.980
 before the defeat against dresden 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.050
 operates 0 was then again 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.090
 clearly yes I think that that 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.299
 in the extension is decided and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.070
 60 then forward 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.530
 yes, I see the similar on the paper 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.290
 should actually be 60 stronger but 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.360
 An agreement dated are always for one 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.490
 Going well in the storm will say of the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.620
 bochumern because even with the backdrop 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.240
 probably not from boro 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.550
 will be lush 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.230
 yes, I also think that it is more and more 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.610
 leave the game then in the 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.970
 penalty shootout respectively 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.920
 Extension is decided from the 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.500
 direct comparisons two teams one can 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.080
 do not pull anything out because of that 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.920
 last direct comparison already eight 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.590
 years ago that was 2004 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.720
 Well it was the first in the Bundesliga 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.860
 2004 in the second Bundesliga in the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.020
 last game also a draw 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.930
 both went out in this before 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.520
 year decidedly gone out because of that 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.800
 I think the trend continues 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.970
 then I would say goodbye 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.200
 us at this point 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.200
 Serve your brothers
