guys actually heard that part but I

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.210

actually<00:02:44.720> literally<00:02:45.620> walk<00:02:45.860> through<00:02:46.130> his

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
actually literally walk through his

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.130 
actually literally walk through his
bullets<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.700> he<00:02:46.940> started<00:02:47.360> celebrating<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
bullets and he started celebrating that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.350 
bullets and he started celebrating that
he<00:02:48.200> cut<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.470> kill<00:02:48.830> before<00:02:49.550> he<00:02:49.910> got<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> killer
