00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.520 
you think there's more than hundred more
than<00:02:29.020> 500<00:02:29.830> ppm<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:31.270> think<00:02:31.840> there's<00:02:31.990> more<00:02:32.200> than<00:02:32.260> a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
than 500 ppm I think there's more than a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.050 
than 500 ppm I think there's more than a
thousand<00:02:32.980> words<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.360> how<00:02:35.260> do<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.850> that's<00:02:36.850> our

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
thousand words so how do you that's our

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.850 
thousand words so how do you that's our
big<00:02:37.240> question<00:02:37.660> we're<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.840> photographic<00:02:38.710> how

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
big question we're in photographic how

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.690 
big question we're in photographic how
do<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.460> reader<00:02:40.380> figure<00:02:41.380> out<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:42.490> one

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
do you as a reader figure out which one

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.360 
do you as a reader figure out which one
of<00:02:42.730> those<00:02:42.880> words<00:02:43.120> are<00:02:43.330> most<00:02:43.480> important<00:02:44.050> is

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
of those words are most important is

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.190 
of those words are most important is
every<00:02:45.370> single<00:02:45.670> thousand<00:02:46.540> word<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> air

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
every single thousand word in the air

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.760 
every single thousand word in the air
the<00:02:48.100> same<00:02:48.340> Orbis<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:51.070> where<00:02:52.320> does<00:02:53.320> our<00:02:53.470> brain

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
the same Orbis so where does our brain

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.130 
the same Orbis so where does our brain
decide<00:02:54.190> which<00:02:55.000> words<00:02:55.330> do<00:02:55.600> we<00:02:55.750> need<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.990> know

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
decide which words do we need to know

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.530 
decide which words do we need to know
which<00:02:56.710> works<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.100> me<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.430> understand<00:02:57.910> which

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
which works for me to understand which

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.450 
which works for me to understand which
words<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:59.080> need<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.260> take<00:02:59.530> with<00:02:59.800> us<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.340> keep

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
words we need to take with us and keep

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.130 
words we need to take with us and keep
in<00:03:00.640> our<00:03:00.730> brain<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.570> they're<00:03:01.900> really

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
in our brain because they're really

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.320 
in our brain because they're really
important<00:03:02.710> I'm<00:03:03.520> going<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.730> show<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.000> little

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
important I'm going to show you a little

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.820 
important I'm going to show you a little
bit<00:03:04.450> how<00:03:04.570> your<00:03:04.750> brain<00:03:04.930> does<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.350> today<00:03:05.590> in

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
bit how your brain does that today in

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.390 
bit how your brain does that today in
like

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.560 

yeah<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.760> then<00:03:13.940> how<00:03:14.060> do<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.210> decide<00:03:14.510> that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
yeah and then how do you decide that

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.960 
yeah and then how do you decide that
that's<00:03:15.560> our<00:03:15.710> question<00:03:16.160> today<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.370> figure<00:03:16.730> out

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
that's our question today to figure out

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.640 
that's our question today to figure out
how<00:03:17.150> do<00:03:17.210> we<00:03:17.390> know<00:03:17.570> something<00:03:18.140> important<00:03:18.560> I

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
how do we know something important I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.730 
how do we know something important I
think<00:03:18.740> it's<00:03:19.070> big<00:03:21.700> ok<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:23.090> all<00:03:23.300> long<00:03:23.840> words<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
think it's big ok on all long words the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.850 
think it's big ok on all long words the
most<00:03:24.980> important<00:03:25.460> words<00:03:25.670> oh<00:03:26.530> that's<00:03:27.530> kind<00:03:27.830> of

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
most important words oh that's kind of

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.800 
most important words oh that's kind of
tricky<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.880> got<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.120> make<00:03:29.240> a<00:03:29.300> decision<00:03:29.600> that

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
tricky so we got to make a decision that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.770 
tricky so we got to make a decision that
you<00:03:30.320> might<00:03:30.560> find<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.980> wrong<00:03:31.160> word<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:32.390> might

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
you might find the wrong word that might

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.160 
you might find the wrong word that might
be<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:34.280> important<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:35.060> know<00:03:35.240> but<00:03:36.050> you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
be really important to know but you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.630 
be really important to know but you
might<00:03:36.320> just<00:03:36.500> find<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.830> long<00:03:37.010> word<00:03:37.250> because<00:03:37.550> the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
might just find a long word because the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.410 
might just find a long word because the
author<00:03:37.790> put<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.210> in<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:39.260> we've<00:03:40.250> got<00:03:40.490> to<00:03:40.760> think

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
author put it in so we've got to think

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.140 
author put it in so we've got to think
about<00:03:41.630> in<00:03:42.110> our<00:03:42.200> brain<00:03:42.530> what<00:03:42.860> we<00:03:43.010> need<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.370> do<00:03:43.550> so

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
about in our brain what we need to do so

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.510 
about in our brain what we need to do so
I<00:03:44.210> brought<00:03:44.480> some<00:03:44.870> language<00:03:45.370> when<00:03:46.370> you're

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
I brought some language when you're

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.610 
I brought some language when you're
building<00:03:46.790> Legos<00:03:47.720> how<00:03:47.930> many<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.320> build

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
building Legos how many of you build

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.710 
building Legos how many of you build
something<00:03:48.980> with<00:03:49.070> Legos<00:03:49.400> before<00:03:49.730> all<00:03:50.480> right

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
something with Legos before all right

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.080 
something with Legos before all right
you<00:03:51.170> never<00:03:51.320> felt<00:03:51.590> those<00:03:51.770> Legos<00:03:52.130> before<00:03:52.490> all

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
you never felt those Legos before all

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.510 
you never felt those Legos before all
right<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:53.960> when<00:03:54.170> you're<00:03:54.290> building<00:03:54.470> with<00:03:54.710> Legos

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
right so when you're building with Legos

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.970 
right so when you're building with Legos
what<00:03:56.300> is<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.570> first<00:03:56.840> decision<00:03:57.350> thank<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.770> but

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
what is the first decision thank you but

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.430 
what is the first decision thank you but
let's<00:03:58.280> say<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.610> is<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> giant<00:03:59.570> box<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.290> Lego's

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
let's say this is a giant box of Lego's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.340 
let's say this is a giant box of Lego's
let's<00:04:00.950> say<00:04:01.220> there<00:04:01.820> are<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.000> thousand<00:04:02.780> Legos

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
let's say there are a thousand Legos

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.080 
let's say there are a thousand Legos
because<00:04:04.010> there<00:04:04.160> was<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.340> thousand<00:04:04.790> words<00:04:04.970> in

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
because there was a thousand words in

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.670 
because there was a thousand words in
this<00:04:05.180> book<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:06.020> let's<00:04:06.050> say<00:04:06.380> there's<00:04:06.590> a

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
this book so let's say there's a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.060 
this book so let's say there's a
thousand<00:04:07.310> Lego<00:04:07.550> in<00:04:08.090> front<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.890> okay<00:04:09.890> let

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
thousand Lego in front of you okay let

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.130 
thousand Lego in front of you okay let
me<00:04:10.190> sit<00:04:10.490> these<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.060> carpet<00:04:11.390> breaker<00:04:11.600> he

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
me sit these on the carpet breaker he

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.140 
me sit these on the carpet breaker he
was<00:04:12.260> huge<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.800> part<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:13.580> we<00:04:13.820> can<00:04:13.970> say

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
was huge a part of it so we can say

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.300 
was huge a part of it so we can say
we'll<00:04:14.330> spread<00:04:14.690> them<00:04:14.840> all<00:04:14.930> up<00:04:15.140> pretend<00:04:16.130> there's

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
we'll spread them all up pretend there's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.229 
we'll spread them all up pretend there's
like<00:04:16.460> 50<00:04:16.820> times<00:04:17.060> more<00:04:17.180> than<00:04:17.450> this

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
like 50 times more than this

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.140 
like 50 times more than this
like<00:04:18.479> this<00:04:18.660> case<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.560> there's<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.489> thousand

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
like this case so there's a thousand

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.029 
like this case so there's a thousand
Legos<00:04:21.599> all<00:04:21.870> over<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.470> floor

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
Legos all over the floor

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.339 
Legos all over the floor
what<00:04:23.699> is<00:04:23.819> the<00:04:23.970> first<00:04:24.270> decision<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.110> make

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
what is the first decision you make

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.339 
what is the first decision you make
about<00:04:25.919> what<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.310> important<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.930> build

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
about what is important if you build

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.620 
about what is important if you build
something<00:04:28.440> that's<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.430> first<00:04:29.819> decision<00:04:30.509> your

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
that I most want made let's say I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.110 
that I most want made let's say I
determined<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.849> was<00:04:48.240> going<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.139> build<00:04:49.349> a<00:04:49.650> house

is<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.360> going<00:04:51.539> to<00:04:51.659> make<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.020> sorting

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
is that going to make the sorting

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.230 
is that going to make the sorting
through<00:04:52.680> all<00:04:52.740> these<00:04:52.949> Legos<00:04:53.370> easier<00:04:55.159> yes

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
through all these Legos easier yes

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.390 
through all these Legos easier yes
because<00:04:57.240> every<00:04:57.659> piece<00:04:58.349> that<00:04:58.710> let's<00:04:58.979> say<00:04:59.130> each

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
because every piece that let's say each

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.969 
because every piece that let's say each
piece<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.940> a<00:04:59.970> word<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.319> a<00:05:01.349> word<00:05:01.590> this

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
piece is a word so this is a word this

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.980 
piece is a word so this is a word this
is<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.159> word<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.789> word<00:05:03.000> every<00:05:03.720> piece

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
is the word of this is word every piece

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.499 
is the word of this is word every piece
I<00:05:04.169> can<00:05:04.349> make<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.530> decision<00:05:04.889> is<00:05:05.639> this<00:05:06.030> important

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509
