P<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> plus<00:01:06.479> plus<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> believe<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
P a plus plus so I believe this is a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359 
P a plus plus so I believe this is a
mineral<00:01:09.420> powder<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.320> compared<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> agreed

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
mineral powder I compared the agreed

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330 
mineral powder I compared the agreed
ingredients<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.860> Laura<00:01:13.860> Mercier

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
ingredients with the Laura Mercier

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.719 
ingredients with the Laura Mercier
mineral<00:01:15.210> powder<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.590> mostly<00:01:17.159> similar

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
mineral powder and it's mostly similar

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.670 
mineral powder and it's mostly similar
so<00:01:18.830> that's<00:01:19.830> why<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.460> used<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
so that's why it can be used as a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
so that's why it can be used as a
foundation<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.820> talked<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.240> brush<00:01:24.479> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
foundation I just talked to my brush so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
foundation I just talked to my brush so
so<00:01:26.009> that's<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> brush<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so that's the brush and so that's the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.660 
so that's the brush and so that's the
inside<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:29.360> compact<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> brush<00:01:31.140> is

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
one I've used it with the travel kabuki

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.020 
one I've used it with the travel kabuki
brush<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:46.440> worked<00:03:46.799> really<00:03:47.070> really<00:03:47.609> nice

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
brush and it worked really really nice

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.500 
brush and it worked really really nice
and<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.630> was<00:03:48.870> amazed<00:03:49.290> how<00:03:49.709> kind<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.760> invisible

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
and I was amazed how kind of invisible

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.660 
and I was amazed how kind of invisible
it<00:03:51.660> looks<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.650> gives<00:03:52.920> evens<00:03:53.549> out

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
it looks and it just gives evens out

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.970 
it looks and it just gives evens out
your<00:03:53.730> skin<00:03:53.910> tones<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:55.079> won't<00:03:55.380> cover<00:03:55.590> anything

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
your skin tones it won't cover anything

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.920 
your skin tones it won't cover anything
but<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.519> gives<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.120> really<00:03:57.630> really

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
but it just gives you a really really

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.069 
but it just gives you a really really
nice<00:03:58.140> panelist<00:03:58.769> on<00:03:58.950> your<00:03:59.100> face<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.660> it's

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
nice panelist on your face and so it's

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.199 
nice panelist on your face and so it's
really<00:04:01.350> hard<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.769> describe<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.459> think<00:04:02.910> it's

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
really hard to describe but I think it's

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.729 
really hard to describe but I think it's
you<00:04:03.390> know<00:04:03.420> one<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.049> best<00:04:04.290> powder

same it's amazing amazing product can

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.340 
same it's amazing amazing product can
use<00:04:47.310> liquid<00:04:47.550> foundation<00:04:48.180> with<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.480> but<00:04:49.110> I'm

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
use liquid foundation with it but I'm

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.050 
use liquid foundation with it but I'm
just<00:04:49.620> going<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.830> keep<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.220> with<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.700> powder

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
just going to keep it with this powder

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.790 
just going to keep it with this powder
because<00:04:51.480> they<00:04:51.630> work<00:04:51.810> really<00:04:52.050> really<00:04:52.170> well<00:04:52.410> and

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
because they work really really well and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.160 
because they work really really well and
also<00:04:53.430> I'm<00:04:54.030> afraid<00:04:54.480> if<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.720> use<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.960> liquid

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.690 
also I'm afraid if I use a liquid
foundation<00:04:55.410> is<00:04:55.860> going<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.190> be<00:04:56.280> very<00:04:56.490> difficult

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
foundation is going to be very difficult

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.430 
foundation is going to be very difficult
to<00:04:56.970> wash<00:04:57.210> because<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:57.750> can't<00:04:57.990> really<00:04:58.200> see

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
to wash because you can't really see

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.870

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
is also synthetic it's very fun very

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.440 
is also synthetic it's very fun very
similar<00:05:18.630> very<00:05:19.080> soft<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.800> it's<00:05:20.670> pretty<00:05:21.210> much

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
similar very soft and it's pretty much

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.390 
similar very soft and it's pretty much
on<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.780> same<00:05:21.990> kind<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.380> softness<00:05:22.890> at<00:05:23.130> sea

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
on the same kind of softness at sea

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.230 
on the same kind of softness at sea
chanel<00:05:23.760> so<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.510> know<00:05:24.630> on<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.080> hand<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:26.240> it

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
chanel so you know on the hand and it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200 
chanel so you know on the hand and it
feels<00:05:27.320> probably<00:05:28.320> 90%<00:05:28.740> similar<00:05:29.610> think<00:05:30.090> he

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
feels probably 90% similar think he

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.810 
feels probably 90% similar think he
works<00:05:30.420> pretty<00:05:31.100> similar<00:05:32.100> so<00:05:32.340> if<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:32.610> are

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
works pretty similar so if you are

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820 
works pretty similar so if you are
considering<00:05:33.510> this<00:05:33.660> wines<00:05:33.960> will<00:05:34.200> be<00:05:34.320> around<00:05:34.530> 10

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
considering this wines will be around 10

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.740 
considering this wines will be around 10
pounds<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.430> that<00:05:35.940> should<00:05:36.150> be<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.300> really<00:05:36.600> good

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
pounds and that should be a really good
