00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello guys and well back with a new one 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.200
 crazy team this time we will go to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.150
 analyze this team sent by mine 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.550
 friend wilde the young who among other things 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.020
 manages my facebook page really 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.280
 a good boy 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.510
 this time he really created a team 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.180
 awesome that runs around shadin 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.650
 already this strategy was already running for a while 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.600
 of time however not being 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.490
 well known, however, decided to do it 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.630
 a video on why it's really one 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.160
 show guys let's go see it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.220
 then the opponent starts with tele votes 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.560
 with scratch you are probably a team 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.050
 trico room just see the pokémon caja 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.030
 in the team and the fact that he started 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.770
 precisely with a rus 7 le trick with a 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:58.149
 fake autre me gaudino evolves fa dating 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:02.200
 lim that makes a nice 60 percent scratch e 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.579
 carving makes barter then barter on 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.409
 audino 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.710
 consequently now carbyn call 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.010
 killer skills of audino audino 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.800
 to the ability to force, that is to say, vigor of 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.600
 carwings and you wonder what the fuck 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.640
 iron best tours give that much audacity 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.150
 it doesn't go down in one go for it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.220
 anything 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.440
 remember for vigor is a skill 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.470
 which allows your pokémon to 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.000
 resist with a ps color stay to life 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.560
 full and is about to go ko at a stroke e 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 meanwhile goti tel 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 it tickles most likely because 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.900
 he just wants to hit later 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.619
 con saint jacques audino equa card inc 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 makes explosion then frees the place to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.100
 pokémon that will enter later 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.979
 now guys while the tritium la 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.590
 graphics change and enter shadin already ok of 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.280
 new tickling and now ethical moment 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.420
 guys epic moment because out 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.700
 does beauty after is not club says about 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.550
 already forgiving of the attack to enter 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 mind and remember that it enabled 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.980
 real audino had the vigor he had 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.319
 past carmen so this means 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.290
 right that this year shadin already with 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 vigor and vigor 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.370
 boys as you will see very soon 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.430
 makes shadin already immortal because it has 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.820
 always full life but has 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.550
 consequently also only one ps 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.940
 consequence always remains at a ps 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.370
 look at this moment you got it 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.350
 hit shadin already but shadin not already 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.300
 takes damage because life is full 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.730
 should remain in force by a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.069
 ps but he is already a ps accordingly 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.380
 life remains full of new crunch but 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:05.930
 nothing is done 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:09.120
 resists thanks to stuhr of wow wow wow 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.730
 and this particular shadin already has it as well 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.590
 the vulnerability accordingly when 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.510
 gets hit by a super move 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.730
 effective than greatly increases the attack 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.590
 the special attack does not go ko then 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.209
 among other things in your showdown 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.100
 sadism someone had proposed to 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.500
 put black bull insurance the shooting 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.950
 here you guys are your Bulgarian 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.950
 pollica 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:44.590
 iron and it's however no way for the team 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.660
 of bad girl hot to take out this cd 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.810
 already because the boys are here now 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.180
 also the safeguard cannot be 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.739
 practically scalded poisoned nothing 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.349
 so even the state moves do not 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.500
 no time can really do it 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.989
 really a destructive ninja show 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.060
 let's go straight away to realize that 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.019
 what actually can destroy 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.510
 this cd already so what is that 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.750
 could exactly stop this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.269
 shange with stuhr di pensiamoci stuhr 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.160
 to block any attack moves that 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.950
 therefore do some shadin damage already 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.139
 because it will always remain with a ps of 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.720
 consequently only the state moves 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.789
 that cause poisoning or 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.570
 sunburn could do him harm 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.510
 however, with safeguarding it cannot be 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.310
 poisoned or burned a great deal 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.740
 alternative as a safeguard 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.930
 it lasts only five rounds would be to 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.270
 give instead of safeguarding your wave to 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.280
 own audino in order to paralyze the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.889
 your own shadin already and of 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.200
 consequently make it immune to 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.820
 burns to poisoning for everything 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.789
 the rest of the game at this point 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.530
 removed the status conditions and removed 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.380
 the physical attacks remain only 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.510
 among other things the conditions 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.330
 atmospheric such as sand and 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.910
 the hail they would send o ko ed in 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.300
 already imu turn only since he has a 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.789
 only ps however the anti - sand visor a 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.430
 shadin we already make it immune to 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.460
 weather conditions and also also 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.900
 to moves like spore and rage powder now 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.060
 so we left already immune to 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.540
 good attacks on good status 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.510
 weather conditions 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.800
 what could ever harm him steps 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.620
 seed 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.870
 jokes aside, no jokes aside a 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.540
 body because palasystema actually 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.670
 however, not all teams can damage it 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.920
 obviously they have it 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.130
 indeed usually if in the premier team not 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.880
 you see a real chestnut you are very sure that 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.980
 will not have para last system opponent 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.020
 what to say then could actually 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.990
 be a problem 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.130
 the backlash caused by the paper 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.650
 glass for example of soccer or iron 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.830
 so much iron bars come back 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.420
 be careful when you stick with shading can 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.240
 be a good idea to set fire to the fatuous 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.620
 shadin already for this very reason 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.540
 or obviously also the bie torto 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.250
 the helmet that is less predictable than the two 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.440
 things that I mentioned before then state 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.450
 very careful a state exhibit on 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.360
 sedin already could prevent 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.250
 embarrassing situations that say then 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.240
 guys and a team that works little 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.310
 because a normally not prepared team 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.740
 as soon as he sees the picking team and finds a 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.570
 way to counter this strategy 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.810
 but when it goes to port it really is 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.720
 too funny so have fun with 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.520
 your shadin already invincible 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.940
 we see the next crazy video 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.940
 hi wow it was so anti-climatic
