00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
of a leadership issue do you think the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.190

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.870 
South Africa ice an experienced issue
particularly<00:00:59.560> colours<00:00:59.950> but<00:01:00.160> hopefully<00:01:00.760> he'll

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
particularly colours but hopefully he'll

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.130 
particularly colours but hopefully he'll
come<00:01:00.910> back<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.420> World<00:01:01.600> Cup<00:01:01.810> so<00:01:01.990> that's

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
come back to the World Cup so that's

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.360 
come back to the World Cup so that's
something<00:01:02.350> so<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.650> we<00:01:02.830> need<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.070> look<00:01:03.190> at

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
something so that we need to look at

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.429 
something so that we need to look at
whether<00:01:03.520> they<00:01:03.730> need<00:01:03.940> some<00:01:04.689> more<00:01:04.869> experience

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
whether they need some more experience

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.960 
whether they need some more experience
in<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.740> middle<00:01:05.950> or<00:01:06.070> red<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.280> number<00:01:06.729> six

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
in that middle or red that number six

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.399 
in that middle or red that number six
position<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:07.600> that's<00:01:07.750> certainly<00:01:08.350> something

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
position so that's certainly something

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.500 
position so that's certainly something
for<00:01:08.770> them<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.979> think<00:01:09.159> about<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:10.210> bit<00:01:10.420> of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
for them to think about and a bit of

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.880 
for them to think about and a bit of
patience<00:01:10.870> perhaps<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.290> some<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.590> batting

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
patience perhaps in some of the batting

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.530 
patience perhaps in some of the batting
well<00:01:12.250> definitely<00:01:12.730> I<00:01:12.760> mean<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.090> run<00:01:13.240> rate<00:01:13.360> was

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
well definitely I mean the run rate was

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.210 
well definitely I mean the run rate was
never<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:13.840> problem<00:01:14.230> all<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.530> needed<00:01:14.710> was<00:01:14.920> just<00:01:14.980> a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
never a problem all it needed was just a

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.160 
never a problem all it needed was just a
few<00:01:15.520> cards<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.180> prevail<00:01:16.510> knocking<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> ball

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
few cards to prevail knocking the ball

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
few cards to prevail knocking the ball
around<00:01:17.350> waiting<00:01:17.890> for<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.070> baddy<00:01:18.100> livery<00:01:18.640> and

Africa<00:01:21.159> will<00:01:21.280> be<00:01:21.370> disappointed<00:01:21.760> they'll<00:01:22.060> know

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
Africa will be disappointed they'll know

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
that's kind of the ultimate sin but

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.399

Africa air to ball them out and that's

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.870 
Africa air to ball them out and that's
exactly<00:01:35.200> what<00:01:35.470> happened<00:01:35.799> so<00:01:35.979> that's<00:01:36.430> why<00:01:36.700> from

South African sport of view they'll be
even<00:01:38.290> more<00:01:38.530> disappointed<00:01:38.710> because<00:01:39.220> they<00:01:39.460> were

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
even more disappointed because they were

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.310 
even more disappointed because they were
never<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.060> under<00:01:40.450> pressure<00:01:40.720> as<00:01:40.990> far<00:01:41.200> as

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
run rate was concerned it was just a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.000 
run rate was concerned it was just a
case<00:01:43.540> of<00:01:43.570> trying<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.290> at<00:01:44.409> about<00:01:44.680> forty

from the India's site they'll obviously

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.160 
from the India's site they'll obviously
take<00:01:48.370> one<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.549> lot<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.729> half<00:01:48.970> room<00:01:49.240> from<00:01:49.900> the

they will and they were didn't buried

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.410 
they will and they were didn't buried
and<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.369> we<00:01:54.490> also<00:01:54.640> have<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.909> remember<00:01:55.119> they're

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
and and we also have to remember they're

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.600 
and and we also have to remember they're
playing<00:01:55.659> with<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.930> subcontinent<00:01:56.890> combination

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
playing with a subcontinent combination

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.370 
playing with a subcontinent combination
under<00:01:58.119> South<00:01:58.299> African<00:01:58.659> conditions<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.229> they

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
under South African conditions so they

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.899 
under South African conditions so they
can<00:01:59.530> pull<00:01:59.680> off<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.890> win<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.250> South<00:02:00.400> Africa<00:02:00.760> with

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
can pull off a win in South Africa with

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.730 
can pull off a win in South Africa with
the<00:02:00.940> combination<00:02:01.510> they'd<00:02:01.630> playing<00:02:01.840> not<00:02:02.110> they

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the combination they'd playing not they

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440 
the combination they'd playing not they
even<00:02:03.189> more<00:02:03.340> likely<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.760> do<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.119> during<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
even more likely to do so during the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.539 
even more likely to do so during the
World<00:02:04.630> Cup<00:02:04.720> at<00:02:04.960> home<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.500> they'll<00:02:06.010> take<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.310> lot

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
World Cup at home so they'll take a lot

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.219 
World Cup at home so they'll take a lot
from<00:02:06.729> this<00:02:06.880> one<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.900> said<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.110> think

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
from this one and as I said I think

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.419 
from this one and as I said I think
South<00:02:08.500> Africa<00:02:08.890> will<00:02:09.009> be<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.129> bit<00:02:09.280> disappointed

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
South Africa will be a bit disappointed

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.910 
South Africa will be a bit disappointed

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.580 
what we're getting for the positive for
South<00:02:44.300> Africa<00:02:44.690> suppose<00:02:45.020> Graham<00:02:45.290> Smith

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
South Africa suppose Graham Smith

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.130 
South Africa suppose Graham Smith
finally<00:02:46.280> getting<00:02:46.700> some<00:02:46.850> runs<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.959> he'll

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
finally getting some runs so it he'll

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.210 
finally getting some runs so it he'll
obviously<00:02:48.290> take<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> lot<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.800> confidence<00:02:49.040> from

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
obviously take a lot of confidence from

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.680 
obviously take a lot of confidence from
that<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.550> needed<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.910> get<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.060> score<00:02:50.360> he<00:02:50.480> hasn't

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
that I needed to get a score he hasn't

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.240 
that I needed to get a score he hasn't
got<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> score<00:02:51.080> since<00:02:51.320> their<00:02:51.470> first<00:02:51.680> innings<00:02:52.130> at

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
got a score since their first innings at

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.130 
got a score since their first innings at
the<00:02:52.340> first<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.760> match<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.239> it'll<00:02:53.690> help<00:02:53.870> him<00:02:54.019> a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the first this match so it'll help him a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.900 
the first this match so it'll help him a
lot<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.530> also<00:02:55.040> think<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.430> South<00:02:55.610> Africa's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
lot and I also think from South Africa's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.800 
lot and I also think from South Africa's
point<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.150> view<00:02:56.239> their<00:02:56.360> balling<00:02:56.630> has<00:02:56.720> been

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
point of view their balling has been

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.270 
point of view their balling has been
very<00:02:57.019> good<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.350> their<00:02:57.800> feelings<00:02:58.130> been

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
very good and their feelings been

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.720 
very good and their feelings been
excellent

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
excellent

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.460 
excellent
I<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.330> case<00:02:59.570> of<00:02:59.600> history<00:02:59.989> repeating

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
I think it's a case of history repeating

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.620 
I think it's a case of history repeating
similar<00:03:01.340> similarities<00:03:02.030> here<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> test

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
similar similarities here to the test

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.240 
similar similarities here to the test
series<00:03:02.840> wasn't<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.170> worth<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.650> India<00:03:03.890> losing

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
series wasn't it worth with India losing

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.530 
series wasn't it worth with India losing
the<00:03:04.340> first<00:03:04.519> match<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:04.910> convincingly<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the first match so convincingly and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.000 
the first match so convincingly and
coming<00:03:05.780> back<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.380> little<00:03:06.620> bit<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:06.980> I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
coming back it is a little bit and I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.590 
coming back it is a little bit and I
know<00:03:07.069> South<00:03:07.370> Africa<00:03:07.670> were<00:03:07.760> determined<00:03:08.360> not<00:03:08.540> to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
know South Africa were determined not to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600 
know South Africa were determined not to
lose<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.350> ruthless<00:03:09.769> streak<00:03:09.980> they<00:03:10.160> wanted<00:03:10.489> to

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
lose that ruthless streak they wanted to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.550 
lose that ruthless streak they wanted to
really<00:03:11.180> cement<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.840> first<00:03:12.080> victory<00:03:12.290> that

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
really cement that first victory that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.930 
really cement that first victory that
they<00:03:12.680> had<00:03:12.860> but<00:03:13.040> now<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.310> sets<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.640> up<00:03:13.730> pretty

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
they had but now it sets it up pretty

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.490 
they had but now it sets it up pretty
well<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.300> go<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.510> Cape<00:03:14.720> Town<00:03:14.750> from<00:03:15.080> here<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.380> go

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640 
to Port Elizabeth
those<00:03:16.610> surfaces<00:03:17.150> should<00:03:17.480> suit<00:03:17.750> India<00:03:18.140> better

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
those surfaces should suit India better

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.170 
those surfaces should suit India better
than<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.040> first<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.550> played<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:19.819> us<00:03:19.970> I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
than the first that I played on us I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.640 
than the first that I played on us I
think<00:03:20.269> we're<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.630> for<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.840> real<00:03:21.079> cracker<00:03:21.410> man

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
think we're in for a real cracker man

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.289 
think we're in for a real cracker man
it's<00:03:21.980> going<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.220> say<00:03:22.370> yeah<00:03:22.579> what<00:03:23.120> are<00:03:23.180> your

thoughts<00:03:23.540> for<00:03:23.660> their<00:03:23.840> for<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> next

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
thoughts for their for the for the next

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.530 
thoughts for their for the for the next
three<00:03:25.220> matches<00:03:25.549> well<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.120> still<00:03:26.360> have<00:03:26.510> to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
three matches well you still have to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.300 
three matches well you still have to
back<00:03:26.810> South<00:03:26.989> Africa<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.410> win<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.739> in<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.190> end

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
back South Africa to win it in the end

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.370 
back South Africa to win it in the end
under<00:03:28.820> certain<00:03:29.000> conditions<00:03:29.750> simply<00:03:30.110> because

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
under certain conditions simply because

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.990 
under certain conditions simply because
the<00:03:30.500> bowling<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.190> good<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.549> they're

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
the bowling is pretty good and they're

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.610 
the bowling is pretty good and they're
feeling<00:03:32.209> solid<00:03:32.660> as<00:03:32.750> well<00:03:32.900> as<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.110> think<00:03:33.170> over<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
feeling solid as well as I think over a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.470 
feeling solid as well as I think over a
five<00:03:33.829> made<00:03:34.070> serious<00:03:34.430> at<00:03:34.610> home<00:03:34.790> you've<00:03:35.269> got<00:03:35.450> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
five made serious at home you've got a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.170 
five made serious at home you've got a
backup<00:03:35.690> roaches
