00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
anyway I ended up with what I am wearing

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.429 
anyway I ended up with what I am wearing
today<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.959> what<00:01:21.499> I<00:01:21.530> loved<00:01:21.889> about<00:01:21.979> it<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:23.439> so

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
today and what I loved about it is so

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.550 
today and what I loved about it is so
for<00:01:24.789> those<00:01:25.789> of<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.209> do<00:01:26.539> wear<00:01:26.810> like

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
for those of you that do wear like

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.649 
for those of you that do wear like
wearing<00:01:27.859> neutral<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.609> kind<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.329> like<00:01:29.450> nude

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
wearing neutral and kind of like nude

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.399 
wearing neutral and kind of like nude
colors<00:01:30.319> my<00:01:30.979> lips<00:01:31.280> are<00:01:31.639> pretty<00:01:32.060> rosy<00:01:32.749> naturally

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
colors my lips are pretty rosy naturally

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.260 
colors my lips are pretty rosy naturally
so<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.950> think<00:01:34.159> that's<00:01:34.429> probably<00:01:34.579> why<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:34.880> like<00:01:35.060> to

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
so I think that's probably why I like to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.289 
so I think that's probably why I like to
neutral<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.229> much<00:01:36.439> but<00:01:36.939> there<00:01:37.939> are<00:01:38.060> days<00:01:38.270> that

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
neutral so much but there are days that

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.419 
neutral so much but there are days that
that<00:01:39.020> natural<00:01:39.229> color<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.770> just<00:01:39.829> like<00:01:40.130> oh<00:01:40.310> you

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
that natural color is just like oh you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.760 
that natural color is just like oh you
know<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:40.969> this<00:01:41.600> color<00:01:41.899> tastes<00:01:42.289> pretty<00:01:42.439> but

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
know that this color tastes pretty but

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.590 
know that this color tastes pretty but
then<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.189> feel<00:01:43.549> like<00:01:43.579> parts<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.299> day<00:01:44.420> your

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
then I feel like parts of the day your

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.910 
then I feel like parts of the day your
lips<00:01:44.779> look<00:01:44.869> at<00:01:44.990> dry<00:01:45.170> or<00:01:45.229> whatever<00:01:45.709> so

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
lips look at dry or whatever so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.160 
lips look at dry or whatever so
sometimes<00:01:46.279> I'm<00:01:46.429> like<00:01:46.579> why<00:01:47.479> isn't<00:01:47.719> there<00:01:47.959> Shay

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
sometimes I'm like why isn't there Shay

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.889 
sometimes I'm like why isn't there Shay
that<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:48.590> mimics<00:01:48.979> my<00:01:49.219> color<00:01:49.579> exactly<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.479> I

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
that just mimics my color exactly and I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.389 
that just mimics my color exactly and I
think<00:01:50.929> that's<00:01:51.319> kind<00:01:51.649> of<00:01:51.679> what<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:51.859> found<00:01:52.099> in

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
think that's kind of what I found in

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.389 
think that's kind of what I found in
this<00:01:52.549> new<00:01:53.179> Chanel<00:01:53.569> color<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.679> thought<00:01:55.189> it

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
this new Chanel color and I thought it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.249 
this new Chanel color and I thought it
was<00:01:55.520> enough<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:55.939> give<00:01:56.359> a<00:01:56.599> little<00:01:56.779> bit<00:01:56.899> of<00:01:56.959> color

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
was enough to give a little bit of color

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.980 
was enough to give a little bit of color
and<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:58.520> look<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.759> little<00:01:58.880> more<00:01:59.090> awake<00:01:59.599> and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and you look a little more awake and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.559 
and you look a little more awake and
alive<00:02:00.349> I<00:02:00.619> guess<00:02:00.649> than<00:02:01.099> those<00:02:02.090> super<00:02:02.359> nude

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
alive I guess than those super nude

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.569 
alive I guess than those super nude
colors<00:02:02.959> but<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.679> still<00:02:03.950> wasn't<00:02:04.159> something

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.470 
love of her life
his<00:02:36.959> name<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.440> boy<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.540> guess<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.810> her

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
his name was boy so I guess it was her

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.180 
his name was boy so I guess it was her
the<00:02:42.480> love<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> her<00:02:42.900> life<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.380> lipstick<00:02:43.830> forms

the love of her life in lipstick forms

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.620 
the love of her life in lipstick forms
so<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.760> thought<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.150> was<00:02:45.240> kind<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.450> cute

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
so that I thought that was kind of cute

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.580 
so that I thought that was kind of cute
so<00:02:45.870> anyway<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.890> what<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.520> it's<00:02:47.850> very

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
so anyway that's what that is it's very

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.229 
so anyway that's what that is it's very
kind<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> moist<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.640> not<00:02:50.850> just<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.209> a

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
kind of moist so it's not just like a

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.590 
kind of moist so it's not just like a
crazy<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:52.470> color<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.300> like

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
crazy like what color and I kind of like

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.880 
crazy like what color and I kind of like
that<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.230> think<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.530> makes<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.800> little

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
that and I think it makes it a little

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.820 
that and I think it makes it a little
softer<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.080> makes<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.200> look<00:02:58.320> youthful<00:02:58.560> and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
softer and makes it look youthful and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.470 
softer and makes it look youthful and
the<00:03:01.830> other<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.340> bold<00:03:02.580> would<00:03:02.820> be<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.300> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
the other more bold would be like a
