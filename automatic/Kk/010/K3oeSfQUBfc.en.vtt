the<00:00:23.250> only<00:00:23.490> difference<00:00:23.880> between<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.480> method<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the only difference between the method I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.509 
the only difference between the method I
use<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.350> time<00:00:25.619> around<00:00:25.830> compared<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
use this time around compared to the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.349 
use this time around compared to the
last<00:00:26.670> time<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.990> rather<00:00:28.529> than<00:00:28.710> doing

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
last time is that rather than doing

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.500 
last time is that rather than doing
three<00:00:30.679> braids<00:00:31.679> three<00:00:32.160> massive<00:00:32.579> braids<00:00:33.030> on

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
three braids three massive braids on

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.020 
three braids three massive braids on
either<00:00:33.989> side<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> my<00:00:34.649> hair<00:00:34.980> after<00:00:35.190> Flatiron<00:00:35.820> in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
either side of my hair after Flatiron in

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.900 
either side of my hair after Flatiron in
it<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.780> did<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.200> braid<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.129> big<00:00:38.399> braid<00:00:38.700> on

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it I just did one braid one big braid on

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
it I just did one braid one big braid on
each<00:00:39.059> side<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.809> that's<00:00:40.020> what's<00:00:40.230> created<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
each side so that's what's created this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.090 
each side so that's what's created this
sort<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> wavy<00:00:41.670> effect<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> hair<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.100> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
sort of wavy effect on the hair and that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.720 
sort of wavy effect on the hair and that
it<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:44.820> look<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.360> use<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> curling<00:00:46.320> iron

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
it does look like I use a curling iron

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.010 
it does look like I use a curling iron
but<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.789> didn't<00:00:48.090> use<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> curling<00:00:48.510> iron<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
but I didn't use a curling iron it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.779 
but I didn't use a curling iron it's
just<00:00:49.230> brains<00:00:49.530> basically<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.610> using

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
just brains basically I like using

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
just brains basically I like using
braids<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.210> they're<00:00:51.420> slightly<00:00:51.780> more

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
braids because they're slightly more

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.750 
braids because they're slightly more
effective<00:00:52.260> than<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> curling<00:00:53.039> armors<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.640> me

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
effective than the curling armors for me

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.740 
effective than the curling armors for me
anyway<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.020> um<00:00:55.520> yeah<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.730> down<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.570> business

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
hair I don't know if that makes a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
hair I don't know if that makes a
difference<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.930> anyway<00:01:37.320> yeah<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
difference but anyway yeah so from the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
difference but anyway yeah so from the
back<00:01:38.579> oh<00:01:43.159> I'll<00:01:44.159> say<00:01:44.750> exactly<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.079> same<00:01:46.229> no

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
back oh I'll say exactly the same no

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
back oh I'll say exactly the same no
difference<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.600> looks

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
difference so you can see what it looks

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.370 
difference so you can see what it looks
like<00:01:48.869> from<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> back

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
bothered basically I just think it's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.370 
bothered basically I just think it's
unnecessary

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
unnecessary

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
unnecessary

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I mean you pretty much get an idea of

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.730

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
looking at the picture and we do know

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:04.930 
looking at the picture and we do know
that<00:02:04.290> hair<00:02:04.619> grow

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
that hair grow

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.500 
that hair grow
was<00:02:05.030> about<00:02:05.300> two-inches<00:02:06.080> sorry<00:02:07.300> yeah<00:02:08.300> if

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
was about two-inches sorry yeah if

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.750 
was about two-inches sorry yeah if
there's<00:02:08.690> about<00:02:08.900> two<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.260> three<00:02:09.400> two<00:02:10.400> inches

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
there's about two to three two inches

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.410 
there's about two to three two inches
yeah<00:02:11.740> one<00:02:12.740> inch<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:13.430> what<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> did

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
yeah one inch I think what you I did

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.340 
yeah one inch I think what you I did
mention<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.930> one<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.050> my<00:02:15.110> other<00:02:15.290> videos

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
mention this in one of my other videos

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.140 
mention this in one of my other videos
it's<00:02:15.770> like<00:02:16.070> one<00:02:16.250> or<00:02:16.400> two<00:02:16.520> inches<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.970> month

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's like one or two inches of month

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.500 
it's like one or two inches of month
hair<00:02:17.360> grows<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.870> think<00:02:18.760> I'm<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.970> sure<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.480> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
hair grows I think I'm not sure but I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.450 
hair grows I think I'm not sure but I
think<00:02:20.600> that's<00:02:20.930> probably<00:02:21.350> about<00:02:21.710> how<00:02:22.070> much

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
think that's probably about how much

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.630 
think that's probably about how much
hair<00:02:22.760> grows<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.360> um<00:02:23.570> just<00:02:24.400> google<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.490> you
