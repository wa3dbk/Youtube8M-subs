 be victims of bands dedicated to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 organ trafficking and the best 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.100
 cases be stopped and repatriated so

 unaccompanied migrant children who 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.660
 they manage to get rid of sexual exploitation 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.850
 travel by public transport to the

 arriaga municipality in Chiapas 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.700
 risk that they are arrested locked up and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.110
 later deported to Central America not 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.200

 half of them were alone running away from the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.880
 violence and the lack of opportunities 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.130
 that any child who is arrested in 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.290
 from Guatemala Honduras Mexico if the 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.470
 Savior is something that has a case like 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.940
 illness if it's brought here and it's 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.009

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.030
 the little ones that manage to reach 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.250
 Municipality of Arriaga seek where 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.680
