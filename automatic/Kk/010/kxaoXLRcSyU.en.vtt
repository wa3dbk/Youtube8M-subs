or<00:00:28.619> no<00:00:29.519> cubes<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.330> yeah<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.080> that's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
or no cubes I think yeah I think that's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.799 
or no cubes I think yeah I think that's
what<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.769> basically<00:00:32.759> what<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.090> does<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
what it is basically what this does is

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
what it is basically what this does is
it<00:00:34.200> sort<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> breaks<00:00:35.280> minecraft<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.450> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
um so yeah you can basically make a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
um so yeah you can basically make a
choo-choo<00:01:32.700> train<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:35.150> let's<00:01:36.150> uh<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
choo-choo train of that let's uh get the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
choo-choo train of that let's uh get the
trees<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.340> look<00:01:38.460> different<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:38.970> look

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
trees they don't look different but look

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
trees they don't look different but look
at<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.630> land<00:01:40.400> damn<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:43.259> usually<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
at this land damn and usually this this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.490 
at this land damn and usually this this
right<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.570> nothing<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.229> blocks

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
right here would be nothing but blocks

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
right here would be nothing but blocks
so<00:01:46.649> you'd<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.369> jump<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so you'd have to do this jump all the
