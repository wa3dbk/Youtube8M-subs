miracle-worker where it's going to take

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.300 
miracle-worker where it's going to take
it<00:02:22.870> away<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.050> know<00:02:23.319> in<00:02:23.440> five<00:02:23.590> days<00:02:23.770> or<00:02:24.010> any<00:02:24.130> or

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
it away you know in five days or any or

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.860 
it away you know in five days or any or
not<00:02:24.520> five<00:02:24.730> days<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.180> know<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.600> couple

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
not five days so you know like a couple

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.860 
not five days so you know like a couple
hours<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.470> whatever<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:28.000> use<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.330> overnight

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
hours or whatever but I use it overnight

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.920 
hours or whatever but I use it overnight
and<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.230> obviously<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.600> pimples<00:02:31.600> are<00:02:31.720> still

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
and it obviously the pimples are still

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.100 
and it obviously the pimples are still
there<00:02:32.080> but<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:33.490> helps<00:02:34.090> minimize<00:02:34.480> them<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.870> lot

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
there but it helps minimize them a lot

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.630 
there but it helps minimize them a lot
and<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.709> mean<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.010> cuts<00:02:39.459> down

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and it it was in it I mean it cuts down

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.130 
and it it was in it I mean it cuts down
at<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.940> time<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.360> your<00:02:40.480> pimples<00:02:40.840> going<00:02:41.020> away

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
at the time of your pimples going away

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.660 
at the time of your pimples going away
it<00:02:41.230> cuts<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> down<00:02:41.560> probably<00:02:41.950> by<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> few<00:02:42.520> days

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
it cuts it down probably by a few days

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.250 
it cuts it down probably by a few days
so<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.860> wash<00:02:44.860> my<00:02:45.070> face<00:02:45.250> with<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.840> have

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
caddy eraser and then on top of that at

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.580 
caddy eraser and then on top of that at
nighttime<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.660> use<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.989> spa<00:03:08.170> treatment

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
nighttime I just use the spa treatment

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.009 
nighttime I just use the spa treatment
and<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.250> really<00:03:09.700> does<00:03:09.880> help<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.390> doesn't

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
and it it really does help it doesn't

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.180 
and it it really does help it doesn't
take<00:03:11.140> away<00:03:11.170> redness<00:03:11.680> or<00:03:11.800> anything<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.130> that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
take away redness or anything like that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.670 
take away redness or anything like that
actually<00:03:12.910> if<00:03:13.239> anything<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.690> probably<00:03:14.170> makes

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
actually if anything it probably makes

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.949 
actually if anything it probably makes
them<00:03:14.920> more<00:03:15.130> red<00:03:15.370> maybe<00:03:15.790> because<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.330> helping

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
them more red maybe because it's helping

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.870 
them more red maybe because it's helping
or<00:03:17.230> something<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.680> don't<00:03:17.829> know<00:03:17.920> but<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.519> lot<00:03:18.640> of

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
or something I don't know but a lot of

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.729 
or something I don't know but a lot of
times<00:03:19.060> um<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.989> because<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.260> couple<00:03:20.470> times

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739
