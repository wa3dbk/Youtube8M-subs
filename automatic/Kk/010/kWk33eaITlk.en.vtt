which<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.540> variation<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.620> Recon<00:00:07.950> class

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
which is a variation of the Recon class

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.629 
which is a variation of the Recon class
this<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.880> bolt-action<00:00:09.750> sniper<00:00:10.639> variation

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
this the bolt-action sniper variation

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
this the bolt-action sniper variation
and<00:00:11.960> it<00:00:12.960> costs<00:00:13.769> 10<00:00:14.580> part<00:00:14.880> points<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.929> it's

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and it costs 10 part points but it's

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.370 
and it costs 10 part points but it's
down<00:00:16.529> priced<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:17.190> minute<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:18.029> only<00:00:18.420> seven<00:00:18.720> five

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
points so it's just temporary not

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.900

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the primary weapon and no the secondary

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
the primary weapon and no the secondary
weapon<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> buy<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.030> yourself

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
weapon you have to buy that one yourself

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
weapon you have to buy that one yourself
but<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> primary<00:01:34.229> weapon<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.610> quite<00:01:36.000> some

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
but the primary weapon it's quite some

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.760 
but the primary weapon it's quite some
damage<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.840> had<00:01:36.990> shot<00:01:37.259> people<00:01:37.470> then

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
damage if you had shot people then

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
damage if you had shot people then
you'll<00:01:38.040> instantly<00:01:38.520> kill<00:01:38.850> them<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.329> with

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you'll instantly kill them and it's with

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.380 
you'll instantly kill them and it's with
all<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.829> believe<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.000> also<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
all that I believe I think it's also a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.899 
all that I believe I think it's also a
jerk<00:01:42.750> identity<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.350> shot<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.829> kill<00:01:43.860> em<00:01:44.189> I'm

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
jerk identity one shot one kill em I'm

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.850 
jerk identity one shot one kill em I'm
not<00:01:45.240> entirely<00:01:45.600> sure<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
not entirely sure about it there but I

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.020 
not entirely sure about it there but I
think<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.890> primary<00:01:50.189> weapon<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
think it is so the primary weapon is a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
think it is so the primary weapon is a
long-range<00:01:51.780> high<00:01:52.079> damage<00:01:52.380> both<00:01:52.829> action

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
long-range high damage both action

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.910 
long-range high damage both action
sniper<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> use<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.229> either<00:01:55.320> medium

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
sniper and you can use for either medium

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
sniper and you can use for either medium
or<00:01:56.100> long<00:01:56.340> ranges<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.960> very<00:01:58.200> accurate

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
or long ranges and it's a very accurate

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.950 
or long ranges and it's a very accurate
gun

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
gun

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.900 
gun
the<00:02:00.590> nice<00:02:00.770> thing<00:02:01.070> about<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.400> gun<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.760> has

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
the nice thing about the gun is it has

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.140 
the nice thing about the gun is it has
variable<00:02:02.450> optics<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:04.190> can<00:02:04.430> zoom<00:02:04.730> in<00:02:05.030> and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
variable optics so you can zoom in and

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.840 
variable optics so you can zoom in and
out<00:02:05.300> with<00:02:05.360> your<00:02:05.660> scope<00:02:06.260> actually<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:06.980> you<00:02:07.430> if

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
out with your scope actually so you if

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.030 
out with your scope actually so you if
you're<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.570> medium<00:02:08.960> range<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.740> the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
you're like a medium range you have the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.240 
you're like a medium range you have the
scope<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.270> zoomed<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.230> when<00:02:13.070> you

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
scope like and zoomed out and when you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.190 
scope like and zoomed out and when you
are<00:02:13.520> going<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.970> long<00:02:14.180> range<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.720> consume

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
are going to long range then you consume

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.070 
are going to long range then you consume
in<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.830> lot<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.670> can<00:02:17.150> steer<00:02:17.480> enemies<00:02:17.840> better

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
in a lot so you can steer enemies better

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.840 
in a lot so you can steer enemies better
which<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.500> really<00:02:18.830> nice<00:02:19.040> thing<00:02:19.070> about<00:02:19.430> this

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
which is a really nice thing about this

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.320 
which is a really nice thing about this
gun

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
gun

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.660 
gun
it<00:02:20.810> really<00:02:21.080> makes<00:02:21.320> slopping<00:02:21.800> lot<00:02:21.950> easier<00:02:22.400> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
it really makes slopping lot easier and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.570 
it really makes slopping lot easier and
it's<00:02:22.820> really<00:02:23.000> useful<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.460> very

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
it's really useful so it's it's very

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.050 
it's really useful so it's it's very
user<00:02:26.180> friendly<00:02:26.360> weapon<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> say<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.680> that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
user friendly weapon to say it like that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.510 
user friendly weapon to say it like that
now<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> problem<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:30.380> that's<00:02:30.560> very<00:02:30.710> very<00:02:31.370> very

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
now a problem is that's very very very

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.270 
now a problem is that's very very very
close<00:02:31.970> quarters<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:33.500> not<00:02:33.740> very<00:02:34.010> effective

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
close quarters it's not very effective

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.600 
close quarters it's not very effective
there<00:02:34.580> due<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> poor<00:02:35.720> hipfire<00:02:36.200> accuracy

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
there due to the poor hipfire accuracy

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.930 
there due to the poor hipfire accuracy
the<00:02:37.610> only<00:02:37.910> four<00:02:38.209> bullet<00:02:38.600> magazine<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the only four bullet magazine and a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.660 
the only four bullet magazine and a
combination<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.870> all<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> things<00:02:42.670> for

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
combination of all the things for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.800 
combination of all the things for
example<00:02:43.790> slow<00:02:44.390> fire<00:02:44.720> right<00:02:44.959> now<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.510> still

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
example slow fire right now it it still

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
example slow fire right now it it still
can<00:02:47.990> kill<00:02:48.170> enemies<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.740> close<00:02:48.980> quarters<00:02:49.520> but<00:02:49.700> I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
can kill enemies in close quarters but I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.300 
can kill enemies in close quarters but I
really<00:02:50.630> do<00:02:50.930> not<00:02:51.140> free<00:02:51.320> come<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.890> use<00:02:52.040> it

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
really do not free come to you to use it

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
really do not free come to you to use it
in<00:02:52.430> close<00:02:52.850> quarters<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.720> what<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.320> should

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
in close quarters and what you should

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.979 
in close quarters and what you should
use<00:02:54.530> o'clock<00:02:54.920> also<00:02:55.340> we're<00:02:55.520> talking<00:02:55.670> about

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
use o'clock also we're talking about

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.920 
use o'clock also we're talking about
later<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.410> video<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:59.209> also<00:02:59.540> want<00:02:59.870> to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
later in this video so I also want to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.620 
later in this video so I also want to
fork<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.530> talk<00:03:00.709> about<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.010> little<00:03:01.310> bit<00:03:01.430> about

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
fork to talk about a little bit about

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.190 
fork to talk about a little bit about
the<00:03:02.630> second<00:03:03.110> thing<00:03:03.290> bill<00:03:03.500> T<00:03:03.739> which<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the second thing bill T which is the

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.750 
the second thing bill T which is the
remote<00:03:06.200> explode<00:03:06.620> which<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.190> saw<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
remote explode which you just saw and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.310 
remote explode which you just saw and
you<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.209> shoot<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.720> remote<00:03:09.019> remote

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
you can shoot the remote remote

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.670 
you can shoot the remote remote
explosive<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:11.000> crowd<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.450> enemies<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.200> then

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
explosive to crowd of enemies and then

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.810 
explosive to crowd of enemies and then
detonate<00:03:13.130> whenever<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.580> feel<00:03:13.760> like

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
detonate whenever you feel like

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.300 
detonate whenever you feel like
detonating<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.780> now<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.350> really<00:03:15.830> useful

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
detonating it now this is really useful

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.370 
detonating it now this is really useful
because<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:16.730> good<00:03:16.910> for<00:03:16.940> crowd<00:03:17.330> control<00:03:17.380> and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
because it's good for crowd control and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.680 
because it's good for crowd control and
you<00:03:18.830> can<00:03:18.950> kill<00:03:19.160> quite<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.640> lot<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.030> enemies<00:03:20.480> with

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
you can kill quite a lot of enemies with

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.310 
you can kill quite a lot of enemies with
it<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:21.769> deals<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.370> think<00:03:23.120> something<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.600> 300

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
it it deals I think something like 300

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.039 
it it deals I think something like 300
damage<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.950> all<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.310> enemies<00:03:25.580> in<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:26.450> radius<00:03:26.900> of

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
damage to all the enemies in a radius of

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.890 
damage to all the enemies in a radius of
5<00:03:27.230> meters<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.790> that's<00:03:29.209> very<00:03:29.269> useful

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
5 meters so that that's very useful

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.420 
5 meters so that that's very useful
especially<00:03:30.019> when<00:03:30.500> there's<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:31.040> big<00:03:31.220> crowd

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
especially when there's a big crowd

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.680 
especially when there's a big crowd
around<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.730> it's<00:03:34.880> definitely<00:03:35.269> finger

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
around so it's definitely finger

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.509 
around so it's definitely finger
equipment<00:03:36.140> now<00:03:36.320> another<00:03:36.590> thing<00:03:36.709> is<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.340> you

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
equipment now another thing is if you

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.160 
equipment now another thing is if you
have<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.430> key<00:03:40.910> number<00:03:41.239> 5<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.780> know<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
have the the key number 5 I know you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.130 
have the the key number 5 I know you
called<00:03:42.590> swell<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.610> called<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.900> 5th

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
called swell I just called the 5th

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.420 
called swell I just called the 5th
ability<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.739> say<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.130> that

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
ability to say it like that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.840 
ability to say it like that
now<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.299> usually<00:03:47.840> keep<00:03:48.260> mo<00:03:49.220> in<00:03:49.459> there<00:03:49.670> because

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
now I usually keep mo in there because

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.850 
now I usually keep mo in there because
the<00:03:50.120> sniper<00:03:50.360> F<00:03:50.600> really<00:03:50.930> does<00:03:51.170> not<00:03:51.380> have<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.709> lot

can use smoke screen it really is a wide
Verity<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:38.340> uses<00:04:38.970> so<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.780> smoke<00:04:40.080> screen<00:04:40.230> is

another really useful thing with the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.140 
another really useful thing with the
nighthawk<00:04:44.100> class<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:46.220> if<00:04:47.220> make<00:04:47.580> good<00:04:47.820> huge

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
nighthawk class and if make good huge

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.720 
nighthawk class and if make good huge
fit<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.750> can<00:04:48.900> make<00:04:49.110> your<00:04:49.290> Nighthawk<00:04:50.280> even

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
fit you can make your Nighthawk even

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.970 
fit you can make your Nighthawk even
more<00:04:50.880> powerful<00:04:51.480> than<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.780> already<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:52.950> I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
more powerful than it already is so I

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.900 
more powerful than it already is so I
it's<00:04:53.820> really<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.210> useful<00:04:54.870> class<00:04:55.850> now<00:04:56.850> the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
it's really a useful class now the

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.690 
it's really a useful class now the
search<00:04:57.480> ability<00:04:57.870> with<00:04:58.470> Nighthawk<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.520> the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
search ability with Nighthawk is the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.040 
search ability with Nighthawk is the
execution<00:05:00.480> shot<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:03.300> one<00:05:03.600> pretty<00:05:03.930> much

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
execution shot this one pretty much

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.520 
execution shot this one pretty much
deals<00:05:04.560> extra<00:05:05.040> damage<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:06.300> enemies<00:05:06.780> it's

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
deals extra damage to enemies it's

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.110 
deals extra damage to enemies it's
specially<00:05:07.950> good<00:05:08.040> against<00:05:08.310> jerking<00:05:08.730> outs<00:05:08.910> or

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
enemies with very very high hit points

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.550 
enemies with very very high hit points
and<00:05:12.540> because<00:05:13.350> they<00:05:13.650> they<00:05:13.950> can<00:05:14.100> barely<00:05:14.370> die<00:05:14.550> and

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
and because they they can barely die and

and because they they can barely die and
because<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.680> can<00:05:16.770> barely<00:05:17.070> die<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.790> might<00:05:18.000> want

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
because it can barely die you might want

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.390 
because it can barely die you might want
still<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.720> one-shot<00:05:18.990> them<00:05:19.470> or<00:05:19.680> at<00:05:19.890> least<00:05:19.920> do<00:05:20.340> a

still to one-shot them or at least do a

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.180 
still to one-shot them or at least do a
big<00:05:20.850> bang<00:05:21.270> against<00:05:21.780> them<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.890> execution

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
big bang against them so the execution

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.880 
big bang against them so the execution
shop<00:05:23.670> is<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:23.970> real<00:05:24.450> really<00:05:24.690> useful<00:05:25.260> ability<00:05:25.770> to

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
shop is a real really useful ability to

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.130 
shop is a real really useful ability to
do<00:05:26.010> with<00:05:26.190> it

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
do with it

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.570 
do with it
another<00:05:28.140> nice<00:05:28.380> side<00:05:28.740> effect<00:05:29.100> of<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:29.310> ability

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
another nice side effect of this ability

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.640 
another nice side effect of this ability
is<00:05:29.850> when<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.240> kill<00:05:30.660> someone<00:05:31.020> I'm<00:05:31.230> not<00:05:31.350> sure<00:05:31.530> if

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
is when you kill someone I'm not sure if

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.530 
is when you kill someone I'm not sure if
you<00:05:31.740> have<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:31.920> make<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.190> headshot<00:05:33.000> or<00:05:33.060> not<00:05:33.330> I

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
you have to make a headshot or not I

you have to make a headshot or not I
think<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.590> do<00:05:34.830> but<00:05:35.100> I'm<00:05:35.220> not<00:05:35.310> sure<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.820> now<00:05:36.750> if

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
you finish someone off the execution

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.790 
you finish someone off the execution
shot<00:05:38.760> he<00:05:38.940> explodes<00:05:39.450> damaging<00:05:40.080> everyone<00:05:40.590> in<00:05:40.740> a

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
shot he explodes damaging everyone in a

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.580 
shot he explodes damaging everyone in a
two<00:05:40.950> meter<00:05:41.250> radius<00:05:41.730> so<00:05:42.000> that's<00:05:42.750> a<00:05:42.930> very<00:05:43.290> very

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
two meter radius so that's a very very

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.980 
two meter radius so that's a very very
nice<00:05:43.830> side<00:05:44.220> effect<00:05:44.610> of<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.090> ability<00:05:45.480> and

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
nice side effect of that ability and

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.530 
nice side effect of that ability and
this<00:05:46.740> makes<00:05:47.070> also<00:05:47.670> useful<00:05:48.120> for<00:05:48.150> crowd<00:05:48.510> control

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
this makes also useful for crowd control

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.990 
this makes also useful for crowd control
so<00:05:49.200> not<00:05:49.380> only<00:05:49.620> for<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.040> high<00:05:50.250> hitpoints<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.850> it

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
so not only for a high hitpoints and it

you just saw in the video
I<00:05:55.710> just<00:05:55.950> deployed<00:05:56.340> another<00:05:56.820> remote<00:05:57.570> explosive

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
around it so as you see there it was a

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.040 
around it so as you see there it was a
good<00:06:02.700> example<00:06:02.820> of<00:06:03.300> how<00:06:03.390> to<00:06:03.540> use<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:03.990> remote

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
good example of how to use the remote

primary weapons in close Qualis because

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.640 
primary weapons in close Qualis because
your<00:06:46.850> sniper<00:06:47.090> rifle<00:06:47.480> is<00:06:47.600> really<00:06:47.930> not<00:06:48.110> reliable

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
your sniper rifle is really not reliable

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.620 
your sniper rifle is really not reliable
and<00:06:48.890> close<00:06:49.160> quarter's<00:06:49.760> due<00:06:49.970> to<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.270> reasons

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
and close quarter's due to the reasons

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.030 
and close quarter's due to the reasons
I've<00:06:50.810> already<00:06:51.050> told<00:06:51.590> you

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
I've already told you

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.490 
I've already told you
now<00:06:52.790> it's<00:06:53.090> also<00:06:53.330> useful<00:06:53.690> if<00:06:54.140> you<00:06:54.290> have<00:06:54.320> an

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
now it's also useful if you have an

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.950 
now it's also useful if you have an
essence<00:06:54.800> your<00:06:55.010> shotgun<00:06:55.520> ready<00:06:55.730> and<00:06:56.690> you<00:06:56.840> go

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
essence your shotgun ready and you go

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.930 
essence your shotgun ready and you go
close<00:06:57.320> close<00:06:57.620> if<00:06:57.890> you're<00:06:58.040> almost<00:06:58.250> out<00:06:58.550> of<00:06:58.610> ammo

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
close close if you're almost out of ammo

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.610 
close close if you're almost out of ammo
because<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.390> sniper<00:06:59.630> rifle<00:07:00.020> really<00:07:00.320> doesn't

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
because the sniper rifle really doesn't

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.070 
because the sniper rifle really doesn't
have<00:07:00.710> a<00:07:00.740> lot<00:07:00.830> of<00:07:01.010> ammo<00:07:01.430> so<00:07:01.640> it's<00:07:02.510> really<00:07:02.810> really

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
have a lot of ammo so it's really really

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.050 
have a lot of ammo so it's really really
useful<00:07:03.560> if<00:07:03.680> you<00:07:03.830> have<00:07:03.980> like<00:07:04.280> something<00:07:04.880> that

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
useful if you have like something that

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.750 
useful if you have like something that
actually<00:07:05.680> functions<00:07:06.680> quite<00:07:07.040> well<00:07:07.400> in<00:07:07.550> close

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
actually functions quite well in close

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.120 
actually functions quite well in close
quarters<00:07:08.350> enabling<00:07:09.350> you<00:07:09.440> to<00:07:09.470> get<00:07:09.710> more<00:07:09.950> ammo

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
quarters enabling you to get more ammo

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.070

and<00:07:10.520> reload<00:07:10.820> your<00:07:10.970> sniper<00:07:11.240> and<00:07:11.660> go<00:07:11.750> back<00:07:11.960> to
