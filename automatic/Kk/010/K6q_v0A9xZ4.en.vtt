and I'm Matt the cameraman today we'll

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
and I'm Matt the cameraman today we'll
be<00:00:10.380> looking<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> process<00:00:11.459> of<00:00:11.610> mitosis<00:00:11.790> in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
be looking at the process of mitosis in

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.520 
be looking at the process of mitosis in
onion<00:00:12.839> root<00:00:13.110> tip<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.650> might<00:00:14.339> push<00:00:14.639> flashtool

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
onion root tip and might push flashtool

so<00:00:16.530> those<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.039> who<00:00:17.070> don't<00:00:17.460> know<00:00:17.720> histology

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so those of you who don't know histology

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.410 
so those of you who don't know histology
is<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.050> process<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.680> permanently<00:00:20.430> preserving

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
is the process of permanently preserving

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.930 
is the process of permanently preserving
animal<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> plant<00:00:22.380> tissue<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.280> make<00:00:23.760> in

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
animal and plant tissue and make in

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.970 
animal and plant tissue and make in
order<00:00:24.120> to<00:00:24.270> make<00:00:24.390> slides<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.590> view<00:00:25.770> on

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
order to make slides that we can view on

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.910 
order to make slides that we can view on
a<00:00:26.010> microscope<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.210> other<00:00:27.390> words<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.710> a

a microscope in other words going from a
Robins<00:00:29.490> tongue<00:00:29.790> or<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:30.900> onion<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.620> dr.<00:00:31.920> crane's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
garden to a slide that we can use such

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
garden to a slide that we can use such
as<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:38.239> now<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.629> reason<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.320> have

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
as this now the reason that we have

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
as this now the reason that we have
chosen<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.949> use<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> onion<00:00:41.730> root<00:00:41.909> tip<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.449> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
chosen to use the onion root tip in the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.989 
chosen to use the onion root tip in the
white<00:00:42.719> fish<00:00:43.019> flash'<00:00:43.409> is<00:00:44.039> because<00:00:44.550> their<00:00:44.730> cells

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999 
white fish flash' is because their cells

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.299 
white fish flash' is because their cells
reproduce<00:00:45.539> quickly<00:00:45.749> and<00:00:46.199> they<00:00:46.710> absorb<00:00:47.159> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
reproduce quickly and they absorb the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.970 
reproduce quickly and they absorb the
stain<00:00:47.489> easier<00:00:48.300> which<00:00:49.260> means<00:00:49.499> we<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> get

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
stain easier which means we can get

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.790 
stain easier which means we can get
great<00:00:50.219> snapshots<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.030> mitosis<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.499> course

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
great snapshots of mitosis but of course

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.700 
great snapshots of mitosis but of course
you<00:00:53.159> can<00:00:53.370> view<00:00:53.839> mitosis<00:00:54.839> in<00:00:54.960> other<00:00:55.199> animal

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you can view mitosis in other animal

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.919 
you can view mitosis in other animal
plant<00:00:56.069> cells<00:00:56.339> as<00:00:56.519> well<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.420> let's<00:00:57.659> take<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
plant cells as well so let's take a

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.219 
plant cells as well so let's take a
closer<00:00:58.260> look<00:00:58.879> in<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.210> image<00:01:00.420> we're<00:01:00.870> looking

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
closer look in this image we're looking

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.169 
closer look in this image we're looking

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
we have this is a plant because of the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
we have this is a plant because of the
structure<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> rigidity<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> cell<00:01:06.630> walls
