two ways that you can apply products

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.040 
two ways that you can apply products
curly<00:00:16.859> hair<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.310> how<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.449> will<00:00:18.600> affect<00:00:18.960> your

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
curl formation so I'm going to talk

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.710 
curl formation so I'm going to talk
about<00:00:21.529> smoothing<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.740> scrunching<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
about smoothing and scrunching and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
about smoothing and scrunching and
ranking<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.960> scratching<00:00:25.680> your<00:00:25.949> products<00:00:26.340> on

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
but basically smoothing and scrunching

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
separated curls less clumping they're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
separated curls less clumping they're
not<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> stick<00:01:11.909> together<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.540> more

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
