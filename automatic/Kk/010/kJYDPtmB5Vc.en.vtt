videotape<00:00:24.240> landscape<00:00:24.750> instead<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.199> having<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
videotape landscape instead of having it

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.519 
videotape landscape instead of having it
up<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> down<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.500> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.740 

probably<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> wrong<00:00:35.820> way<00:00:38.420> I'll<00:00:39.420> come

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
probably have it the wrong way I'll come

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.490 
probably have it the wrong way I'll come
over<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:41.660> now<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:43.079> blog<00:00:43.320> he

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.020 
over this way now the only blog he
doesn't<00:00:43.829> weigh<00:00:44.010> anything<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> really

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
doesn't weigh anything so you really

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.479 
doesn't weigh anything so you really
want<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> tighten<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.899> down<00:00:46.079> too<00:00:46.410> much

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.680
