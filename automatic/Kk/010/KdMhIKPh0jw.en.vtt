recover at equators so it's it's kind of
amazing<00:02:35.359> that<00:02:36.359> I've<00:02:36.480> been<00:02:36.569> able<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.840> still

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
amazing that I've been able to still

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.699

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.709 
lift as effectively as I have been for
example<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.249> workout<00:02:41.669> here<00:02:41.969> this<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.480> did

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
example this workout here this is I did

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.550 
example this workout here this is I did
this<00:02:42.810> earlier<00:02:42.989> tonight<00:02:43.469> that<00:02:44.180> 515<00:02:45.180> 45<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:46.079> was

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
this earlier tonight that 515 45 I was

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520 
this earlier tonight that 515 45 I was
not<00:02:46.859> sure<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:47.340> was<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.639> happen<00:02:48.530> just

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
not sure that was going to happen just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.490 
not sure that was going to happen just
because<00:02:49.919> that<00:02:50.669> is<00:02:50.730> such<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.540> big<00:02:51.930> wait<00:02:52.169> for<00:02:52.439> me

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
because that is such a big wait for me

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.360 
because that is such a big wait for me
to<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.709> moving<00:02:53.040> without<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.310> belt<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:54.169> you<00:02:55.370> know

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
to be moving without a belt and you know

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.429 
to be moving without a belt and you know
just<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:57.030> fact<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.480> my<00:02:57.810> strength<00:02:58.169> felt

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
just the fact like my strength felt

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.409 
just the fact like my strength felt
solid<00:02:58.739> today<00:02:59.069> but<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.579> recovery<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.120> between

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
solid today but my recovery in between

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.890 
solid today but my recovery in between
sets<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.840> pretty<00:03:01.079> rough<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:02.359> just<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.599> know<00:03:03.689> as

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
sets is pretty rough so just you know as

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.809 
sets is pretty rough so just you know as
a<00:03:03.930> result<00:03:04.319> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.799> different<00:03:05.099> things<00:03:05.340> coming

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
a result of the different things coming

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.689 
a result of the different things coming
together<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.269> being<00:03:06.359> difficult<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.699> to

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
together and being difficult to to

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.009 
together and being difficult to to
overcome<00:03:09.349> but<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.329> at<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.629> end<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.900> all

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
overcome but in the at the end of it all

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.589 
overcome but in the at the end of it all
I<00:03:13.319> still<00:03:14.310> love<00:03:14.519> doing<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.209> I'm<00:03:15.269> excited

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
I still love doing this and I'm excited

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.219 
I still love doing this and I'm excited
because<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.680> know<00:03:16.859> getting<00:03:17.699> through<00:03:18.569> all<00:03:18.629> these

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
because I know getting through all these

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.129 
because I know getting through all these
tough<00:03:20.159> programmed<00:03:20.909> exercises<00:03:21.629> if<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.810> put<00:03:22.019> them

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
tough programmed exercises if I put them

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.749 
tough programmed exercises if I put them
all<00:03:22.349> into<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.620> thing<00:03:23.009> and<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> know<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.639> I'm

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:23.759 
all into one thing and I know that I'm

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.069 
all into one thing and I know that I'm
going<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.060> better<00:03:24.180> by<00:03:24.419> the<00:03:24.479> end<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.840> and

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
going to get better by the end of it and

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.839 
going to get better by the end of it and
I<00:03:26.040> think<00:03:26.159> i'm<00:03:26.370> going<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.549> switch<00:03:26.609> up<00:03:26.729> my

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
I think i'm going to switch up my

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.210 
I think i'm going to switch up my
exercises<00:03:27.599> in<00:03:28.199> another<00:03:28.530> two<00:03:28.739> or<00:03:28.769> three<00:03:28.919> weeks

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
exercises in another two or three weeks

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.580 
exercises in another two or three weeks
but<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.389> know<00:03:30.449> this<00:03:30.689> is<00:03:30.870> building<00:03:31.229> a<00:03:31.290> really

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
but I know this is building a really

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.789 
but I know this is building a really
solid<00:03:31.799> base<00:03:32.040> which<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.430> what<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:32.939> set<00:03:33.180> out<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.329> do

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
solid base which is what I set out to do

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.890 
solid base which is what I set out to do
so<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.759> was<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.090> last<00:03:36.269> couple<00:03:36.509> of<00:03:36.629> days<00:03:36.750> of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
so that was the last couple of days of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.869 
so that was the last couple of days of
training<00:03:37.109> I'll<00:03:37.500> try<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.799> put<00:03:38.189> all<00:03:38.579> three

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879
