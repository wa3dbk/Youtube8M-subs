00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.060
 Carl is charismatic was president of 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.880
 many student clubs 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.020
 we came home from school that day 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.940
 We passed in front of the old restaurant 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.830
 country buffet and we saw someone 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.050
 disguised as a bee dancing outside the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.820
 restaurant and I said great I'm going to talk 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.010
 with them to see if they lend me the suit 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.050
 to dance in front of the school 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.180
 for the election look you told me you know the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.500
 most idiotic idea I've heard 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.500
 then in his presidential campaign 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.120
 we coupled well that he did what he was and 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.640
 she started dancing queen dancing and others 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.650
 topics and a lot of people came to see it 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.330
 luca helped a lot let's say it was the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.630
 key win 60 to 40 so sanz told me 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.300
 for what happened during his adolescence 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.709
 until the middle of last year 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.819
 I think it all started in the seventh grade 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.920
 it seemed that it was getting worse and worse 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.760
 you knew that every night I cried 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.819
 until falling asleep, I never 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.010
 I would have suspected I started feeling very 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.319
 sad he was trying to project a 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.260
 false image like everything was fine 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.519
 got to the point that if I remained the same 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.069
 that would be of me in 5 years in 10 or 20 or 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.349
 50 years that scared me 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.579
 he knew he had a heavenly father to 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.700
 who pray that he would help me and he would 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.810
 did 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.810
 I went ahead 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.410
 I had a lot to do with the gospel the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.600
 depression seems to me that maybe that was 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.290
 the point of my life where I change that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.300
 It was my biggest weakness and who one day 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.460
 become my greatest strength and that 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.490
 two years later it's still my oldest 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.260
 strength gives me a lot of security and if 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.980
 I can change my biggest weakness in a 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:55.080
 day that I can do the most since then 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.249
 what I have returned to fight we have not 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.619
 returned to fight in more than a year 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:02.989
 I just started talking with my brother 

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:05.509
 people are more pleasant than one 

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:07.659
 believe you think the change of look has 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.429
 something to do with your own change if 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.089
 you talk to him practically everything if 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:15.889
 as a girl, there are people who use their 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.960
 personal diary I have my brother 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.479
 greater although it was not always so no 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.000
 I admire him he is like my role model 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.900
 in some situations I think I would say 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.900
 heal now 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.220
 I would say that without a doubt it is my 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.200
 best friend 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.200
 what I am best friends 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.699
 do not 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.570
 all right
