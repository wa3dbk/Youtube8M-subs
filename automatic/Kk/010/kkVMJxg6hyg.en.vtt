and<00:04:40.910> then<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.770> far<00:04:44.010> this<00:04:44.160> keyboard<00:04:44.640> is<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:46.920> has

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
and then so far this keyboard is it has

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.850 
and then so far this keyboard is it has
exceeded<00:04:49.410> my<00:04:49.880> expectations<00:04:50.880> oh<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:52.530> also

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
exceeded my expectations oh it also

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.380 
exceeded my expectations oh it also
comes<00:04:53.040> with<00:04:53.100> some<00:04:53.280> software<00:04:53.940> which<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.240> can

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
comes with some software which I can

gaming<00:05:02.370> software<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:04.020> here<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.980> can<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.430> can

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
gaming software and here you can you can

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.300 
gaming software and here you can you can
assign<00:05:06.720> keys<00:05:07.080> two<00:05:07.260> different<00:05:07.530> things<00:05:07.680> macros

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
assign keys two different things macros

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.550 
assign keys two different things macros
and<00:05:08.340> whatnot<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.780> can<00:05:09.930> trust<00:05:10.140> your<00:05:10.320> back

and whatnot you can trust your back
lighting<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:11.669> can<00:05:11.820> have<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.390> light<00:05:13.050> effects

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
lighting you can have a light effects

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.190 
lighting you can have a light effects
which<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:13.890> pulse<00:05:14.780> guess<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.870> could<00:05:16.020> show<00:05:16.169> you

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
which is pulse guess I could show you

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.550 
which is pulse guess I could show you
and<00:05:16.500> now<00:05:17.630> just<00:05:18.630> going<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.810> crease<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.140> tempo

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
and now just going to crease the tempo

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.600 
and now just going to crease the tempo
so<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:19.950> actually<00:05:20.070> guys<00:05:20.340> if<00:05:20.490> you'll

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
so you can actually guys if you'll

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.930 
so you can actually guys if you'll
actually<00:05:20.760> see<00:05:21.060> it

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.560 

AC<00:05:26.510> comes<00:05:27.410> on<00:05:27.590> dims<00:05:27.920> well<00:05:28.730> not<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.240> other<00:05:29.420> one

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
AC comes on dims well not the other one

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.010 
AC comes on dims well not the other one
is<00:05:29.750> cycle<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.640> cycles<00:05:32.030> through<00:05:32.090> a<00:05:32.600> lot<00:05:32.900> of

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
is cycle so it cycles through a lot of

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.710 
is cycle so it cycles through a lot of
codes<00:05:36.730> see<00:05:37.730> that<00:05:37.880> just<00:05:38.060> changed<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.570> green

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
codes see that just changed to green

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.890 
codes see that just changed to green
from<00:05:39.230> the<00:05:39.290> white<00:05:39.920> got<00:05:40.360> my<00:05:41.360> no<00:05:41.450> be<00:05:41.630> able<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:41.810> see

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
from the white got my no be able to see

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.300 
from the white got my no be able to see
that<00:05:42.050> on<00:05:42.200> the<00:05:42.290> camera<00:05:42.650> but<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:43.130> did<00:05:43.280> just

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
that on the camera but it did just

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.670 
that on the camera but it did just
change<00:05:43.670> the<00:05:43.850> green<00:05:44.000> in<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.180> way<00:05:44.300> but<00:05:45.260> yeah

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
change the green in the way but yeah

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.640 
change the green in the way but yeah
that<00:05:46.370> is<00:05:46.550> that's<00:05:46.910> that's<00:05:47.390> a<00:05:47.510> thing<00:05:47.720> so<00:05:48.440> you<00:05:48.560> got

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
that is that's that's a thing so you got

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.890 
that is that's that's a thing so you got
a<00:05:48.680> lot<00:05:48.860> of<00:05:48.890> software<00:05:49.220> profiles<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.780> all

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
a lot of software profiles and all

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.500 
a lot of software profiles and all
that's<00:05:51.050> all<00:05:51.380> that<00:05:51.620> is<00:05:52.180> stored<00:05:53.180> on<00:05:53.390> the

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
that's all that is stored on the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.910 
that's all that is stored on the
keyboard<00:05:53.870> memory<00:05:54.200> itself<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.680> can<00:05:54.800> just

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
keyboard memory itself so you can just

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.140 
keyboard memory itself so you can just
take<00:05:55.070> it<00:05:55.480> take<00:05:56.480> it<00:05:56.540> anywhere<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.970> do<00:05:58.970> your

thing so that is my quick overview which
is<00:06:03.260> not<00:06:03.410> that<00:06:03.620> quick<00:06:03.890> since<00:06:04.100> this<00:06:04.250> video<00:06:04.610> is

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
is not that quick since this video is

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.120 
is not that quick since this video is
approximately<00:06:05.450> six<00:06:05.660> minutes<00:06:05.780> right<00:06:06.050> now<00:06:06.200> but

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
approximately six minutes right now but

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.890 
approximately six minutes right now but

impressions of this gaming keyboard so

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.670 
impressions of this gaming keyboard so
depending<00:06:15.050> on<00:06:15.400> what<00:06:16.400> happens<00:06:16.430> next<00:06:16.940> I<00:06:17.680> might

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
depending on what happens next I might

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.240 
depending on what happens next I might
do<00:06:18.890> full<00:06:19.190> overview<00:06:19.430> or<00:06:19.820> might<00:06:20.540> not<00:06:20.890> he'll<00:06:21.890> spit

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
do full overview or might not he'll spit

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.560 
do full overview or might not he'll spit
in<00:06:22.370> my<00:06:22.400> not<00:06:22.640> even<00:06:23.030> make<00:06:23.150> it<00:06:23.270> to<00:06:23.330> the<00:06:23.420> web
