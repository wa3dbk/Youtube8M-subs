00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 we are on a circular motion 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 power engineering and highway revolution 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 now move in a circle we are not 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.950
 we will interfere and we will consider everything 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.160
 correct actions while driving 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.840
 please ask a question mean 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.000
 St.Petersburg roundabout 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.910
 there are different entries from all directions 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.619
 by traffic signals 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:34.309
 there is an entry by signs in priority 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 there is like now we see you 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 traffic lights 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 and by signs let's go with you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 circular motion consider all 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.890
 correct and action in order to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.980
 remember and not get confused I suggest 4 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 very important options consider so 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.320
 let's 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.250
 the very first consider entry to green 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 traffic signal 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.789
 note slow down all 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.090
 cars start moving confidently we 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.030
 must miss them 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.790
 I repeat this is the first option yet 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.380
 skipping cars either we start 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.689
 movement along 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 then the green signal went 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.909
 suppose we leave the main road 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 you need to remember here 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.360
 direction is important 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 roads so suppose we continue 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.960
 motion 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 are on the main or repeating we 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.259
 left at the traffic lights the second is very important 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.479
 rule include turn signals 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.610
 now we will consider reset the gas is not 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.119
 accelerate 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.789
 notice the second option 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.470
 including turn signals where necessary 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.580
 do two directions 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.939
 see and you do not turn on the turn signal 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.670
 if you decide to make a roundabout exit 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.289
 movement in fact and included turn signals 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 you need to include right but we will be with you 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.840
 move in a circle again turn on and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 does not work turn signal we considered 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.160
 Two important rules are the following very important 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.700
 rule cars move on signs 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.090
 priority on a roundabout what is their 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090
 task 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 skip pedestrians then driving out 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.390
 roundabout skip car 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 on the main road or not it is necessary and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.130
 pay attention now watch 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:41.340
 marking and then in the marking strips 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.770
 here we see an island of security for 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 we hid him and freely wait when 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:52.760
 drive the car along the main road and 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:56.280
 then another very important option 4 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 this is how to make a congress with 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.740
 Circular motion because we have missed 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.970
 by priority signs means like 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.660
 make the exit if not before 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.910
 include rights was mine if before 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.990
 we did it from the right lane in advance 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.080
 preparing the vehicle 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.070
 now pay attention from three lanes 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.360
 from 2 one wide and from the left side 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:31.020
 average see no such four 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.050
 important options on a circular motion 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.600
 need to remember and then manage 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.600
 the car will be quite simple 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.550
 did you notice that cars 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:52.459
 who started driving on the traffic lights 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.019
 drove 180 degrees met up with 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.459
 oncoming cars 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:02.410
 their advantage is over that is how 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.410
 we moved in circles with us 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.430
 confidently reliably and then again and 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.099
 actually islet and we should 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.760
 stop and skip cars with 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.370
 brave stop the car 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.280
 and then continue on 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.810
 visit me turn right 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.430
 so turn on the right turn signal and 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.169
 note 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:34.500
 us markup gives the right to offset from 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:36.410
 middle lane and right and modern 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.840
 time is a lot of cars 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.840
 so all these movement actions 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:53.419
 simplified means skipping pedestrians 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.419
 do not stand still and continue to move
