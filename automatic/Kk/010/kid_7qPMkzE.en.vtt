all<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:16.070> emissions<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:17.139> templates<00:05:18.139> and

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
all the emissions and templates and

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.200 
all the emissions and templates and
pressures<00:05:18.889> coming<00:05:19.220> from<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.669> engine<00:05:20.030> and

pressures coming from the engine and

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.219 
pressures coming from the engine and
also<00:05:20.810> we<00:05:21.169> will<00:05:21.410> test<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.979> ECU<00:05:22.970> signals<00:05:23.660> that

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
also we will test the ECU signals that

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.749 
also we will test the ECU signals that
