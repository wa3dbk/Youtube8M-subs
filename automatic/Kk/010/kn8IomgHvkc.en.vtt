00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
hello this is Adam el Humphries and I

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello this is Adam el Humphries and I
thought<00:00:03.990> I'd<00:00:04.140> do<00:00:04.290> something<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.680> little<00:00:05.040> bit

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
thought I'd do something a little bit

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.540 
thought I'd do something a little bit
different<00:00:05.819> than<00:00:05.940> my<00:00:06.029> typical<00:00:06.420> video<00:00:07.429> then<00:00:08.429> you

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
different than my typical video then you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.390 
different than my typical video then you
typically<00:00:08.940> find<00:00:09.500> that<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.830> actually<00:00:11.040> broke

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
typically find that I actually broke

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.250 
typically find that I actually broke
down<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.990> Brazilian<00:00:13.830> ponies<00:00:14.670> here

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
down and got the Brazilian ponies here

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.529 
down and got the Brazilian ponies here
and<00:00:16.260> someone<00:00:16.590> else<00:00:16.770> did<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> video

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539

and someone else did a video
demonstrating<00:00:18.539> these<00:00:19.550> but<00:00:20.570> it<00:00:21.570> wasn't<00:00:21.900> an<00:00:21.960> HD

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

implant on her I think she's happy with
it<00:01:38.850> hold<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.299> notice<00:01:39.920> hold<00:01:40.920> down<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.000

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
camera all that background noise it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.710 
camera all that background noise it's
not<00:02:39.769> real<00:02:40.400> loud<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.849> not<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.120> loud<00:02:41.359> as<00:02:41.599> I

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
not real loud it's not as loud as I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.429 
not real loud it's not as loud as I
would<00:02:41.900> was<00:02:42.769> hoping<00:02:43.129> it<00:02:43.310> would<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:44.079> but<00:02:45.079> you<00:02:45.140> can

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
would was hoping it would be but you can

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.690 
would was hoping it would be but you can
hear<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:48.530> not<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.739> bad<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.189> mean<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
hear it it's not that bad I mean I

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.670 
hear it it's not that bad I mean I
wanted<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.450> put<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.629> hole<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.230> head<00:02:51.470> you

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
wanted to put a hole in the head you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.229 
wanted to put a hole in the head you
could<00:02:51.890> be<00:02:52.069> louder<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.609> certainly<00:02:52.970> wasn't

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
could be louder but I certainly wasn't

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:10.199 
could be louder but I certainly wasn't
gonna<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.659> that

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.319 

so<00:03:11.370> okay<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> guess<00:03:12.670> that's<00:03:12.819> interesting

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
so okay I guess that's interesting

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.229 
so okay I guess that's interesting
enough<00:03:13.450> goes<00:03:14.140> through<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.469> rest<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> song

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
enough goes through the rest of the song

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.360 
enough goes through the rest of the song
yeah<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.349> test<00:03:17.620> program<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.250> can

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
yeah then this test program you can

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.819 
yeah then this test program you can
write<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.549> program<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.209> there's<00:03:19.780> an<00:03:20.049> ISP

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
write a program for it there's an ISP

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.369 
write a program for it there's an ISP
header<00:03:21.189> you<00:03:22.030> open<00:03:22.390> her<00:03:22.540> up<00:03:22.569> in<00:03:23.019> these<00:03:23.170> two

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
header you open her up in these two

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.559 
header you open her up in these two
screws<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:24.010> replace<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.790> MacDonald<00:03:25.209> screws

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
screws I replace the MacDonald screws

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.580 
screws I replace the MacDonald screws
with<00:03:26.010> with<00:03:27.010> some<00:03:27.389> regular<00:03:28.389> machine<00:03:28.750> screws

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
with with some regular machine screws

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.920 
with with some regular machine screws
but<00:03:30.030> they<00:03:31.030> even<00:03:31.269> though<00:03:31.359> they<00:03:31.510> were<00:03:31.569> finer

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
but they even though they were finer

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.640 
but they even though they were finer
thread<00:03:32.319> they<00:03:32.560> worked<00:03:32.799> just<00:03:32.980> fine<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:35.170> there's

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
thread they worked just fine so there's

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.879 
thread they worked just fine so there's
an<00:03:35.769> ISP<00:03:36.250> header<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:38.349> can<00:03:38.469> open<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.829> up

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
an ISP header in here you can open it up

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.069 
an ISP header in here you can open it up
and<00:03:39.099> you<00:03:39.159> can<00:03:39.250> program<00:03:39.609> it<00:03:39.790> program<00:03:40.540> her<00:03:40.750> to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
and you can program it program her to

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.800

let's press it again here oh that's just
part<00:03:50.379> of<00:03:50.439> the<00:03:50.500> program<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.099> rode<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:52.090> can<00:03:52.269> write

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
part of the program I rode you can write

00:03:52.419 --> 00:04:01.619 
part of the program I rode you can write
your<00:03:52.569> own<00:03:52.629> program<00:03:53.169> and<00:03:53.349> you<00:03:53.409> want<00:03:53.530> to<00:04:00.510> but<00:04:01.510> we

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
your own program and you want to but we

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.879 
your own program and you want to but we
don't<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:01.900> time<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.230> wait<00:04:02.349> through<00:04:02.560> all<00:04:02.650> that

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
don't have time to wait through all that

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:28.860 
don't have time to wait through all that
so<00:04:03.219> let's<00:04:03.669> dude

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.320 

anyway<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.800> was<00:04:29.919> really<00:04:30.220> difficult<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:31.180> get

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
anyway it was really difficult to get

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.720 
anyway it was really difficult to get
her<00:04:31.480> open<00:04:31.870> without<00:04:32.410> screwing<00:04:33.160> something<00:04:33.490> up

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
her open without screwing something up

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.080 
her open without screwing something up
but<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.150> was<00:04:34.300> able<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.540> do<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.900> no<00:04:35.520> let's<00:04:36.520> turn

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
but I was able to do it no let's turn

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.920 
but I was able to do it no let's turn
her<00:04:37.240> off<00:04:37.270> now<00:04:39.270> let's<00:04:40.270> hold<00:04:40.510> down<00:04:40.690> on<00:04:40.900> the

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
her off now let's hold down on the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.080 
her off now let's hold down on the
commute<00:04:41.290> point<00:04:41.590> hold<00:04:42.160> down<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.580> cue<00:04:42.729> mark

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
commute point hold down on the cue mark

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.070 
commute point hold down on the cue mark
and<00:04:43.389> turn<00:04:44.169> her<00:04:44.350> back<00:04:44.530> on<00:04:45.690> we<00:04:46.690> don't<00:04:46.870> want<00:04:47.020> her

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
and turn her back on we don't want her

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.990 
and turn her back on we don't want her
to<00:04:47.169> make<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.410> bunch<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.710> noise<00:04:47.830> or<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.910> know

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
to make a bunch of noise or you know

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.250 
to make a bunch of noise or you know
depending<00:04:49.300> on<00:04:49.389> how<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.570> write<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.780> program<00:04:50.169> I

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
depending on how you write the program I

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.590 
depending on how you write the program I
didn't<00:04:50.440> want<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.740> make<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.919> bunch<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.190> noise<00:04:51.600> on

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
didn't want to make a bunch of noise on

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.189 
didn't want to make a bunch of noise on
occasion<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.260> just<00:04:53.530> did<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.960> we<00:04:56.050> have

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
occasion so I just did this and we have

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.659 
occasion so I just did this and we have
that<00:04:56.380> if<00:04:56.500> we<00:04:56.650> want<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:56.979> turn<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.250> off<00:04:57.400> just

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
that if we want it to turn it off just

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:58.350 
that if we want it to turn it off just
press<00:04:57.820> it<00:04:58.000> again

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
press it again

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.969 
press it again
and<00:04:59.020> that's<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.900> what's<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.380> point<00:05:02.590> of<00:05:02.800> all

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
and that's so what's the point of all

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.219 
and that's so what's the point of all
this<00:05:04.410> that's<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.740> good<00:05:05.889> question<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:07.110> guess<00:05:08.110> I

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
this that's a good question I guess I

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.690 
this that's a good question I guess I
wanted<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:08.590> challenge<00:05:08.830> myself<00:05:09.040> with<00:05:09.610> the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
wanted to challenge myself with the

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.760 
wanted to challenge myself with the
hardware<00:05:10.090> see<00:05:10.930> if<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.169> can<00:05:11.320> actually<00:05:11.440> fit

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
hardware see if I can actually fit

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.400 
hardware see if I can actually fit
something<00:05:11.979> inside<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.639> her<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:16.290> was<00:05:17.290> able

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
something inside of her and I was able

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.210 
something inside of her and I was able
to<00:05:17.530> do<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:18.570> no<00:05:19.570> no<00:05:19.600> you<00:05:19.960> know<00:05:20.139> I<00:05:20.169> have<00:05:20.260> a<00:05:20.590> comma<00:05:20.860> I

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
to do it no no you know I have a comma I

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.090 
to do it no no you know I have a comma I
would<00:05:21.940> kind<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.300> like<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.510> do<00:05:22.860> Twilight<00:05:23.860> as

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
would kind of like to do Twilight as

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.770 
would kind of like to do Twilight as
well<00:05:24.370> because<00:05:24.850> she's<00:05:25.350> well<00:05:26.350> lights<00:05:27.130> up<00:05:27.340> red

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
well because she's well lights up red

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.830 
well because she's well lights up red
it's<00:05:28.780> kind<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:29.350> close<00:05:29.590> for<00:05:29.889> Pinkie<00:05:30.190> Pie<00:05:30.400> but

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
it's kind of close for Pinkie Pie but

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.950 
it's kind of close for Pinkie Pie but
Applejack<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:32.130> it's<00:05:33.130> just<00:05:33.280> fun<00:05:36.389> so<00:05:37.389> I<00:05:37.750> don't

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
Applejack is it's just fun so I don't

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.250 
Applejack is it's just fun so I don't
know<00:05:38.020> if<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:40.270> I<00:05:40.360> was<00:05:40.450> really<00:05:40.690> reluctant<00:05:40.930> to

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
know if and I was really reluctant to

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.520 
know if and I was really reluctant to
try<00:05:41.950> to<00:05:42.010> sell<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:42.960> I've<00:05:43.960> got<00:05:44.110> all<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.349> work

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
try to sell this I've got all the work

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.490 
try to sell this I've got all the work
output<00:05:44.740> into<00:05:45.370> her<00:05:45.900> but<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:47.530> mean<00:05:48.490> if<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:49.500> she

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
output into her but I mean if it she

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.219 
output into her but I mean if it she
sails<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.160> has<00:05:51.729> resale<00:05:52.210> just<00:05:52.479> a<00:05:52.570> custom<00:05:52.990> pony

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
sails and has resale just a custom pony

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.080 
sails and has resale just a custom pony
I<00:05:53.349> guess<00:05:53.650> it's<00:05:54.250> just<00:05:54.370> not<00:05:54.520> painted<00:05:54.970> or

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
I guess it's just not painted or

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.210 
I guess it's just not painted or
anything<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.510> just<00:05:55.539> has<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:55.870> piezo<00:05:56.830> buzzer<00:05:56.860> in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
anything it just has a piezo buzzer in

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.279 
anything it just has a piezo buzzer in
it<00:05:57.340> and<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:58.389> it<00:05:58.930> controls<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.530> LED<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:01.750> I

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
it and and it controls the LED so I

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.040 
it and and it controls the LED so I
guess<00:06:02.710> people<00:06:02.979> like<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.490> I<00:06:03.580> might<00:06:04.050> make

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
guess people like it I might make

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.010 
guess people like it I might make
another<00:06:05.200> one<00:06:05.530> to<00:06:05.650> sell<00:06:05.889> I<00:06:05.919> don't<00:06:06.220> know<00:06:07.020> I'll

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
another one to sell I don't know I'll

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.170

making it maybe even make her say
release<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.630> tune<00:06:28.870> or<00:06:29.260> maybe<00:06:29.440> I<00:06:29.500> can<00:06:29.710> do<00:06:29.800> that

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
release the tune or maybe I can do that
