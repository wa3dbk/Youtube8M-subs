other screw which is in a bit of an
awkward<00:00:22.260> spot<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:22.830> out<00:00:23.010> under<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.519> but

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
awkward spot to get out under here but

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.720 
awkward spot to get out under here but
it's<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.650> yellow<00:00:25.859> connector<00:00:26.429> which<00:00:26.580> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it's this yellow connector which I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.480 
it's this yellow connector which I
certain<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.660> airbag<00:00:27.960> connector

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
certain would be your airbag connector

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.980 
certain would be your airbag connector
it's<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.910> behind<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.509> black<00:00:30.720> plastic

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
it's just in behind the black plastic

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's just in behind the black plastic
conduit<00:00:31.650> right<00:00:32.160> back<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> where<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.970> thumb<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
conduit right back and where my thumb is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
conduit right back and where my thumb is
touching<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:33.890> connectors<00:00:34.890> back<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.370> place

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
touching here connectors back in place

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
touching here connectors back in place
so<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:37.470> is<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.830> moment<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.190> truth<00:00:39.230> if<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so this is the moment of truth if it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.840 
so this is the moment of truth if it
doesn't<00:00:40.740> work<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.190> something<00:00:41.730> I've

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
doesn't work you know something I've

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.190 
doesn't work you know something I've
