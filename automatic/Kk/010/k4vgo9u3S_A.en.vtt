00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello to all welcome under those of 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.849
 new workshops of the painting workshop 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.219
 how to avoid too fast drying 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.330
 acrylic painting 1 it is true that 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.289
 compared to the oil painting to 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.340
 acrylic paint tends to a lot 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.449
 to dry and it's a little annoying 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.740
 of which for the time being kept a little 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.529
 longer I propose this trick 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:32.260
 if you end up in soaps in the era 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:34.269
 parchment paper from a plate a 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.839
 plastic plate or cardboard 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:42.059
 depends what what you have so we 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:45.729
 let's cut on the diameter of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.260
 the plate the pale tissue paper is 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.960
 we're not going to put it in the bottom of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.239
 then the base and above it will 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.850
 so add a parchment paper 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.900
 nicolas gt cut the sopal m here I am the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.309
 say pose like this and then the paper 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.720
 greaseproof but also we resume 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.670
 the same thing you cut it yourself 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.670
 try to do the best 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.759
 so I continue to make a beautiful circle 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.759
 it's not obvious 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.479
 so I know that some artists 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.549
 put the oil painting in the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 fridge delayed drying as low 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.850
 it's a little bit constraining I 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.979
 especially because we have more room 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 in the fridge 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.179
 so here's the editing and so does 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.130
 now i'm going to add water in 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.810
 my plate 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 so here I have a wet bottom and the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 parchment paper up I press and that's 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.229
 left 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.830
 I can add my red paint done 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.409
 a mixture of blue so that's listening 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.439
 I hope this trick will dare well 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.939
 served I invite you to try and I 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.220
 give you an appointment soon on 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.229
 a new workshop on a workshop 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.610
 common point paint that's if you 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.780
 want to put small comments in 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.049
 bottom of the video I will be happy to 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.049
 soon 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.410
 we
