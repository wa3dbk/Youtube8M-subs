okay<00:00:00.570> so<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:01.170> week<00:00:01.469> I'm<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> cover

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
okay so this week I'm going to cover

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay so this week I'm going to cover
drapery<00:00:04.190> in<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.490> first<00:00:05.759> session<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.870> then

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
drapery in the first session and then

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.330 
drapery in the first session and then
after<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.500> big<00:00:07.649> break<00:00:07.830> we're<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> cover

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
after the big break we're going to cover

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.020 
after the big break we're going to cover
the<00:00:08.940> way<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.960> get<00:00:10.410> features<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.950> face<00:00:11.190> I'm

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the way you get features on the face I'm

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.070 
the way you get features on the face I'm
going<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.210> give<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.360> some<00:00:12.389> little<00:00:12.630> tricks<00:00:12.809> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
going to give you some little tricks to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.049 
going to give you some little tricks to
line<00:00:13.230> them<00:00:13.380> features<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> ideal<00:00:14.759> case

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
line them features for the ideal case

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.080 
line them features for the ideal case
how<00:00:15.960> long<00:00:16.080> he<00:00:16.199> needs<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.500> examples<00:00:16.910> ok<00:00:17.910> will

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
how long he needs to be examples ok will

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.519 
how long he needs to be examples ok will
drain<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.690> there's<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.080> things<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.380> got

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
drain for you there's two things you got

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
drain for you there's two things you got
to<00:00:19.560> remember<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:21.060> drapery<00:00:21.510> has<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
to remember one that the drapery has to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.339 
to remember one that the drapery has to
follow<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> form<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:26.539> it<00:00:27.539> has<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> obey<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
follow the form and it has to obey the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.979 
follow the form and it has to obey the
laws<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.560> gravity<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.719> mean<00:00:33.960> by

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
laws of gravity so what do we mean by

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.810 
laws of gravity so what do we mean by
that<00:00:34.260> i'm<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> give<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> an<00:00:35.399> example<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that i'm going to give you an example it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.220 
that i'm going to give you an example it
done<00:00:36.000> before<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> put<00:00:36.930> clothes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
done before but I'm going to put clothes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
done before but I'm going to put clothes
on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.559> example<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.309> i'll<00:00:38.579> show<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.059> i

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
on the example and i'll show you what i

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
on the example and i'll show you what i
need<00:00:39.360> bye-bye<00:00:39.570> both<00:00:40.200> following<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> farming

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
need bye-bye both following the farming

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.910 
need bye-bye both following the farming
and<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:42.030> loved<00:00:42.360> gravity<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.590> instance

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and they loved gravity for instance

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.939 
and they loved gravity for instance
remember<00:00:45.170> my<00:00:46.170> favorite<00:00:47.160> cases<00:00:51.829> remember<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
remember my favorite cases remember this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.069 
remember my favorite cases remember this
one<00:00:54.140> ok<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.440> he's<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.829> bit<00:00:56.899> hands<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
one ok so he's a little bit hands on the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.600 
one ok so he's a little bit hands on the
ad<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:59.010> arm<00:01:00.890> shoulder<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:05.220> notice<00:01:05.489> I'm

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
ad for arm shoulder you notice I'm

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
ad for arm shoulder you notice I'm
almost<00:01:05.909> drawing<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.510> new<00:01:06.930> figure<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> I'm

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
almost drawing a new figure so I'm

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.850 
almost drawing a new figure so I'm
actually<00:01:10.770> putting<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> form<00:01:11.610> down<00:01:12.710> I'm<00:01:13.710> going

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
actually putting the form down I'm going

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.639 
actually putting the form down I'm going
to<00:01:13.920> drape<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:31.950 

okay<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:28.240> i<00:01:28.570> would<00:01:29.439> suppose<00:01:30.719> i'm<00:01:31.719> going<00:01:31.899> to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
okay now i would suppose i'm going to

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.620 
okay now i would suppose i'm going to
actually<00:01:32.350> put<00:01:33.070> clothes<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> model<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.570> i

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
actually put clothes in the model so i

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.480 
actually put clothes in the model so i
put<00:01:34.990> some<00:01:35.020> draping<00:01:35.320> on<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:35.950> drape<00:01:36.189> waiting

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
put some draping on the drape waiting

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.249 
put some draping on the drape waiting
for<00:01:36.670> instance<00:01:36.909> i<00:01:37.030> put<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.329> on<00:01:37.420> she<00:01:37.929> got<00:01:38.049> loose

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
for instance i put it on she got loose

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.679 
for instance i put it on she got loose
fitting<00:01:38.560> blouse<00:01:38.770> blouse<00:01:39.250> because<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.450> gravity

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
fitting blouse blouse because of gravity

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.120 
fitting blouse blouse because of gravity
would<00:01:40.990> follow<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.439> form<00:01:41.679> of<00:01:41.770> her<00:01:41.890> breasts

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
would follow the form of her breasts

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.039 
would follow the form of her breasts
until<00:01:42.369> i<00:01:42.549> got<00:01:42.670> over<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.000> rest<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.020> was

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
until i got over the rest and it was

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.749 
until i got over the rest and it was
loose<00:01:44.350> fitting<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.979> would<00:01:45.100> basically<00:01:45.280> flow

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
loose fitting it would basically flow

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.419 
loose fitting it would basically flow
downwards<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:46.299> that<00:01:46.829> similar<00:01:47.829> for<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.130> arms

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
downwards like that similar for the arms

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.219 
downwards like that similar for the arms
if<00:01:48.579> i<00:01:48.700> had<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.880> short<00:01:49.179> sleeve<00:01:49.450> shirt<00:01:49.750> on<00:01:49.899> her<00:01:50.020> it

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
if i had a short sleeve shirt on her it

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.139 
if i had a short sleeve shirt on her it
would<00:01:50.409> follow<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.250> form<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.670> arm<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
would follow the form of the arm and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.710 
would follow the form of the arm and
then<00:01:53.280> flow<00:01:54.280> down<00:01:54.549> downwards<00:01:55.240> because<00:01:55.390> of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
then flow down downwards because of

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.679 
then flow down downwards because of
gravity<00:01:56.319> pulling<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.890> down<00:01:57.330> for<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.420> upper

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
gravity pulling it down for the upper

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.499 
gravity pulling it down for the upper
arm<00:01:58.899> again<00:01:59.319> the<00:01:59.979> drapery<00:02:00.670> would<00:02:00.849> follow<00:02:01.090> part

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
arm again the drapery would follow part

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.260 
arm again the drapery would follow part
the<00:02:01.630> upper<00:02:01.869> arm<00:02:02.079> and<00:02:02.409> then<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.670> would<00:02:03.880> wrap

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
the upper arm and then it would wrap

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.719 
the upper arm and then it would wrap
around<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.720> arm<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:04.990> flow<00:02:05.200> down<00:02:05.729> following

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
around the arm and flow down following

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:18.110 
around the arm and flow down following
because<00:02:07.539> of<00:02:07.630> gravity<00:02:09.450> let's<00:02:10.450> suppose<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.989> put<00:02:11.260> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.699 

skirt<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.299> like<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.049> sort<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:21.060> mini<00:02:22.060> skirt<00:02:22.709> but

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
skirt on like a sort of a mini skirt but

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.680 
skirt on like a sort of a mini skirt but
sort<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.310> flowing<00:02:24.579> skirt<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.180> supposed

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
sort of a flowing skirt and supposed

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.990 
sort of a flowing skirt and supposed
King<00:02:26.079> slightly<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.799> would<00:02:26.920> follow<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.670> upper

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
King slightly it would follow the upper

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.390 
King slightly it would follow the upper
leg<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.600> roll<00:02:28.900> around<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.680> then

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
leg and then roll around and then

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.930 
leg and then roll around and then
because<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.060> grab<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.450> full<00:02:31.750> flow<00:02:32.290> down<00:02:32.940> similar

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
because of grab a full flow down similar

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.830 
because of grab a full flow down similar
in<00:02:34.120> back<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:36.190> skirt<00:02:36.459> would<00:02:36.730> follow<00:02:36.940> her<00:02:37.389> box

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
in back the skirt would follow her box

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.009 
in back the skirt would follow her box
but<00:02:38.079> then<00:02:38.430> flow<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> fault<00:02:40.060> essentially<00:02:40.900> be

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
but then flow a fault essentially be

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.379 
but then flow a fault essentially be
pulled<00:02:41.230> down<00:02:41.290> because<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.799> gravity<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.389> then

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
pulled down because of gravity and then

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.780 
pulled down because of gravity and then
essentially<00:02:43.840> come<00:02:44.079> over<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.410> other<00:02:44.440> leg<00:02:44.829> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
essentially come over the other leg and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.840 
essentially come over the other leg and
then<00:02:45.940> probably<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.720> impleaded<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:48.549> notice

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
then probably be impleaded you notice

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.400 
then probably be impleaded you notice
I'm<00:02:48.970> putting<00:02:49.209> hard<00:02:49.450> edge<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.810> quite<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> few

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
I'm putting hard edge is quite a few

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.860 
I'm putting hard edge is quite a few
hard<00:02:50.590> edges<00:02:50.799> on<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> material<00:02:52.540> for

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
hard edges on the on the material for

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.250 
hard edges on the on the material for
the<00:02:52.989> blouson<00:02:53.650> for<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.819> skirt<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
the blouson for the for the skirt and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.660 
the blouson for the for the skirt and
again<00:02:56.500> that's<00:02:56.680> because<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.980> lot<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.220> materials

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
again that's because a lot of materials

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.090 
again that's because a lot of materials
are<00:02:57.880> very<00:02:58.180> crisp<00:02:58.600> relative<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.440> flush<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.889> get

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
are very crisp relative to flush you get

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.400 
are very crisp relative to flush you get
slightly<00:03:00.850> harder<00:03:01.299> edges<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:01.780> them<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.139> i'm

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
slightly harder edges on them but i'm

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
slightly harder edges on them but i'm
not<00:03:02.620> putting<00:03:03.130> wall<00:03:03.459> hard<00:03:03.700> edges<00:03:03.940> particularly

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
not putting wall hard edges particularly

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.569 
not putting wall hard edges particularly
where<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.170> likely<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:06.480> blouse<00:03:07.480> would<00:03:07.810> sort<00:03:08.620> of

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.620 

be<00:03:12.579> pushed<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.359> little<00:03:13.599> bit<00:03:13.870> after<00:03:14.560> past

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
be pushed out a little bit after past

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.349 
be pushed out a little bit after past
area<00:03:16.630> for<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:18.959> scapula<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.200> flow<00:03:20.859> down<00:03:21.359> that

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
area for a scapula and flow down that

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.849 
area for a scapula and flow down that
would<00:03:22.510> not<00:03:22.630> actually<00:03:22.870> put<00:03:23.139> a<00:03:23.169> softer<00:03:23.560> edge<00:03:23.650> on

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
would not actually put a softer edge on

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.240 
would not actually put a softer edge on
that<00:03:24.630> okay<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.290> deal<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.590> let<00:03:27.010> me<00:03:27.099> just

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
that okay so the deal is let me just

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.570 
that okay so the deal is let me just
draw<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.579> again

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
draw it again

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:37.890 
draw it again
now<00:03:28.670> stretch<00:03:28.970> arm<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> full-length

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.320 

drapery<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.200> arm<00:03:39.410> some<00:03:39.920> type<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:41.150> it's

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
drapery on the arm some type so it's

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.520 
drapery on the arm some type so it's
going<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.480> follow<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.020> upper<00:03:42.230> part<00:03:42.440> of<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
going to follow the upper part of the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.440 
going to follow the upper part of the
arable<00:03:42.770> for<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.250> drapery<00:03:43.820> will<00:03:43.970> follow<00:03:44.240> the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
arable for the drapery will follow the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.000 
arable for the drapery will follow the
upper<00:03:44.600> part<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:44.960> the<00:03:45.080> form<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.620> arm<00:03:45.800> but

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
upper part of the form of the arm but

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.770 
upper part of the form of the arm but
then<00:03:46.190> once<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.920> flows<00:03:49.610> down<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.480> got<00:03:50.630> to

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
then once it flows down it's got to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.300 
then once it flows down it's got to
follow<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.170> laws<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.380> gravity<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.070> here<00:03:52.220> I'm

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
follow the laws of gravity so here I'm

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.860 
follow the laws of gravity so here I'm
actually<00:03:52.550> showing<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.210> both<00:03:53.420> principals

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
actually showing you both principals

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.410 
actually showing you both principals
where<00:03:54.230> what<00:03:55.100> follows<00:03:55.490> form<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.030> has<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.300> be

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
where what follows form and has to be

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.740 
where what follows form and has to be
able<00:03:56.480> logs<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.870> gravity<00:03:57.580> let's<00:03:58.580> take<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.090> one

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
able logs of gravity let's take it one

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.120 
able logs of gravity let's take it one
step<00:03:59.810> further<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.710> that<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:02.980> what<00:04:03.980> are<00:04:04.070> we

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
step further and that is what are we

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.330 
step further and that is what are we
doing<00:04:04.400> greatly<00:04:04.940> in<00:04:05.540> terms<00:04:06.110> of<00:04:06.380> what's<00:04:07.010> about<00:04:07.130> a

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
doing greatly in terms of what's about a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.970 
doing greatly in terms of what's about a
spin<00:04:08.209> on<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.480> edge<00:04:08.600> work<00:04:08.900> ahead<00:04:09.380> work<00:04:09.800> with

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
spin on the edge work ahead work with

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.400 
spin on the edge work ahead work with
bravery<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.640> talk<00:04:11.330> about<00:04:11.510> value<00:04:11.780> with<00:04:12.140> Draper

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
bravery and talk about value with Draper

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.190 
bravery and talk about value with Draper
so<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.940> idea<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.630> treated<00:04:14.990> exactly

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
so the idea is that you treated exactly

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.380 
so the idea is that you treated exactly
terms<00:04:15.800> of<00:04:15.980> value<00:04:16.100> treated<00:04:16.640> exactly<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.150> same

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
terms of value treated exactly the same

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.580 
terms of value treated exactly the same
you're<00:04:17.540> going<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.720> get<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> same<00:04:17.959> five

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
you're going to get the same five

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.070 
you're going to get the same five
general<00:04:19.430> values<00:04:19.910> with<00:04:20.540> drape<00:04:20.750> where<00:04:20.930> you're

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
general values with drape where you're

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.020 
general values with drape where you're
going<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.290> get<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.890> highlight<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.670> turning

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
going to get the highlight the turning

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to get the highlight the turning
edge<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.600> cast<00:04:23.810> shadow<00:04:23.980> reflected<00:04:24.980> light

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
edge the cast shadow reflected light

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
edge the cast shadow reflected light
shadow<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.790> then<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.300> mid-tone<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:26.810> it's

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
shadow and then the mid-tone so it's

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.920 
shadow and then the mid-tone so it's
just<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:27.170> we<00:04:27.800> did<00:04:27.920> with<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.730> human<00:04:29.510> form<00:04:29.750> you

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
just like we did with the human form you

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.770 
just like we did with the human form you
get<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.140> same<00:04:30.350> types<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:31.150> lighting<00:04:32.150> and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
get the same types of lighting and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.500 
get the same types of lighting and
shadows<00:04:33.020> with<00:04:33.350> drapery<00:04:33.650> only<00:04:34.580> giving<00:04:34.880> another

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
shadows with drapery only giving another

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.159 
shadows with drapery only giving another
example<00:04:35.900> suppose<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.650> have<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:38.140> piece<00:04:39.140> of

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
example suppose I have a piece of

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.690 
example suppose I have a piece of
drapery<00:04:39.680> then<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.950> pinned<00:04:40.190> in<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.370> couple

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
drapery then you pinned in a couple

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.360 
drapery then you pinned in a couple
points<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.470> then<00:04:42.470> it's<00:04:42.620> allowed<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.130> flow

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
points and then it's allowed to flow

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.890 
points and then it's allowed to flow
down<00:04:46.270> okay<00:04:47.620> suppose<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:49.130> where<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:50.480> pinned

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
down okay suppose that where it's pinned

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.140 
down okay suppose that where it's pinned
here<00:04:51.260> I'm<00:04:51.410> going<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.800> basically<00:04:52.280> has<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.550> sort

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
here I'm going that basically has a sort

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.030 
here I'm going that basically has a sort
of<00:04:53.240> crease<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:53.780> where<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.590> goes<00:04:54.710> up<00:04:54.919> and

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
of crease in it where it goes up and

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.350 
of crease in it where it goes up and
over<00:04:55.270> then<00:04:56.270> it's<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.630> valley<00:04:56.900> on<00:04:57.140> this<00:04:57.290> side<00:04:57.530> and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
over then it's a valley on this side and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.850 
over then it's a valley on this side and
again<00:04:59.360> suppose<00:04:59.720> my<00:04:59.870> lighting<00:05:00.230> is<00:05:00.350> coming<00:05:00.710> from

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
again suppose my lighting is coming from

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.940 
again suppose my lighting is coming from
above<00:05:01.130> from<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> left<00:05:01.760> I<00:05:02.440> didn't<00:05:03.440> same<00:05:03.590> value

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
above from the left I didn't same value

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.470 
above from the left I didn't same value
pattern<00:05:04.310> that<00:05:04.430> we<00:05:04.550> talked<00:05:04.790> about<00:05:04.910> couple

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
pattern that we talked about couple

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.030 
pattern that we talked about couple
weeks<00:05:05.540> ago<00:05:05.690> with<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.110> ball<00:05:06.500> with<00:05:06.890> you

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
weeks ago with the ball with you

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.610 
weeks ago with the ball with you
informed<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.780> highlight<00:05:09.230> would<00:05:09.350> be<00:05:09.500> on

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
informed that the highlight would be on

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.250 
informed that the highlight would be on
this<00:05:09.740> side<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.510> then<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.660> go<00:05:11.840> through<00:05:12.050> some

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
this side and then I go through some

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.620 
this side and then I go through some
Midtown's<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:13.100> then<00:05:13.729> I<00:05:13.760> hit<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.150> turning<00:05:14.479> it

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
Midtown's and then I hit it turning it

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.230 
Midtown's and then I hit it turning it
as<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.560> full<00:05:15.770> turns<00:05:16.100> away<00:05:16.280> from<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.729> light<00:05:16.940> I

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
as the full turns away from the light I

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.460 
as the full turns away from the light I
get<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.080> turning<00:05:18.410> edge<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:19.300> then<00:05:20.300> as<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:21.050> going

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
get a turning edge and then as it going

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.500 
get a turning edge and then as it going
down<00:05:21.680> further<00:05:22.010> into<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.460> trough<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:23.060> get<00:05:23.300> some

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
down further into the trough I get some

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.150 
down further into the trough I get some
reflect<00:05:23.870> but<00:05:24.050> if<00:05:24.200> you<00:05:24.260> actually<00:05:24.470> light<00:05:24.919> being

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
reflect but if you actually light being

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.230 
reflect but if you actually light being
reflected<00:05:25.430> back<00:05:25.700> into<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:28.070> fold<00:05:28.610> from<00:05:29.060> the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
reflected back into the fold from the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.710 
reflected back into the fold from the
trough<00:05:29.510> and<00:05:30.640> then<00:05:31.640> I'd<00:05:31.880> actually<00:05:32.150> get<00:05:32.419> a<00:05:32.450> cash

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
trough and then I'd actually get a cash

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.450 
trough and then I'd actually get a cash
out<00:05:33.050> on<00:05:33.200> the<00:05:33.320> trough<00:05:33.620> from<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.130> full

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
out on the trough from the full

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.100 
out on the trough from the full
south<00:05:34.759> which<00:05:35.060> would<00:05:35.180> be<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.389> gun<00:05:35.600> and<00:05:35.720> artists

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
south which would be the gun and artists

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.379 
south which would be the gun and artists
are<00:05:36.289> with<00:05:37.069> all<00:05:37.220> with<00:05:37.490> initially<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:37.910> very<00:05:38.150> very

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
are with all with initially a very very

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:45.189 
are with all with initially a very very
edge<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:42.910> again<00:05:43.910> as<00:05:44.030> I<00:05:44.150> move<00:05:44.509> away<00:05:44.660> on<00:05:45.080> the

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
edge so again as I move away on the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.770 
edge so again as I move away on the
other<00:05:45.319> side<00:05:45.620> from<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.069> from<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:46.910> light<00:05:47.180> I<00:05:47.509> get

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
other side from the from a light I get

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.980 
other side from the from a light I get
haven't<00:05:48.319> have<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.500> mid-tone<00:05:49.509> once<00:05:50.509> I<00:05:50.660> got<00:05:50.810> away

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
haven't have a mid-tone once I got away

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.809 
haven't have a mid-tone once I got away
from<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.259> area<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:51.740> was<00:05:51.860> essentially<00:05:52.580> being

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:52.819 
from the area that was essentially being

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:57.279 
from the area that was essentially being
directly<00:05:53.240> with<00:05:54.759> so<00:05:55.759> I'm<00:05:56.030> simply<00:05:56.599> playing<00:05:56.990> the

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
directly with so I'm simply playing the

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.409 
directly with so I'm simply playing the
same<00:05:57.530> game<00:05:57.830> with<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.490> value<00:05:58.789> patterns<00:05:59.180> as

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
same game with the value patterns as

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.719 
same game with the value patterns as
weakness<00:05:59.990> we<00:06:00.289> talked<00:06:00.560> about<00:06:00.830> and<00:06:01.039> again

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
weakness we talked about and again

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.100 
weakness we talked about and again
you've<00:06:01.910> been<00:06:02.030> used<00:06:02.240> anywhere<00:06:02.569> from<00:06:02.780> four<00:06:03.080> to

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
you've been used anywhere from four to

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.249 
you've been used anywhere from four to
six<00:06:03.289> values<00:06:03.590> making<00:06:04.300> now<00:06:05.300> like<00:06:05.840> I<00:06:05.960> said<00:06:06.020> with

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
six values making now like I said with

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.339 
six values making now like I said with
the<00:06:06.349> drapery<00:06:06.620> how<00:06:06.889> to<00:06:06.949> actually<00:06:08.349> put

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
the drapery how to actually put

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:10.990 
the drapery how to actually put
particularly<00:06:10.250> it<00:06:10.490> depends<00:06:10.729> on<00:06:10.849> the<00:06:10.910> material

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
particularly it depends on the material

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.879 
particularly it depends on the material
of<00:06:11.360> course<00:06:11.570> it's<00:06:11.720> sloping<00:06:12.050> like<00:06:12.229> a<00:06:12.259> hard<00:06:12.710> edges

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
of course it's sloping like a hard edges

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.490 
of course it's sloping like a hard edges
but<00:06:13.160> winning<00:06:13.729> a<00:06:13.970> lot<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.419> lens<00:06:14.630> for<00:06:15.050> Cotton's

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
but winning a lot of lens for Cotton's

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.379 
but winning a lot of lens for Cotton's
and<00:06:15.620> polyesters<00:06:15.680> you<00:06:16.310> put<00:06:16.460> up<00:06:16.580> you'll<00:06:17.150> have<00:06:17.360> a

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
and polyesters you put up you'll have a

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.620 
and polyesters you put up you'll have a
hard<00:06:17.870> edge<00:06:18.110> hard<00:06:18.949> edges<00:06:19.099> relative<00:06:19.820> to<00:06:20.030> any<00:06:20.180> any

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
hard edge hard edges relative to any any

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.140 
hard edge hard edges relative to any any
flesh<00:06:20.960> that's<00:06:21.169> exposed<00:06:21.650> where<00:06:22.639> the<00:06:22.849> flesh<00:06:23.120> is

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
flesh that's exposed where the flesh is

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.719 
flesh that's exposed where the flesh is
not<00:06:23.389> here<00:06:23.870> you're<00:06:24.440> a<00:06:24.470> bone<00:06:24.740> of<00:06:24.770> my<00:06:25.009> arm<00:06:25.250> or<00:06:25.460> are

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
not here you're a bone of my arm or are

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:32.860 
not here you're a bone of my arm or are
my<00:06:25.909> fingers<00:06:26.330> or<00:06:26.570> pleaser<00:06:31.240> so<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.360> idea<00:06:32.479> again

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
my fingers or pleaser so the idea again

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.230 
my fingers or pleaser so the idea again
is<00:06:32.930> you<00:06:33.259> start<00:06:34.190> up<00:06:34.340> with<00:06:34.520> this<00:06:34.669> the<00:06:34.970> same

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
is you start up with this the same

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.379 
is you start up with this the same
format<00:06:35.780> put<00:06:36.500> down<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.979> lines<00:06:37.190> of<00:06:37.340> action<00:06:37.580> the

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
format put down the lines of action the

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.810 
format put down the lines of action the
big<00:06:38.630> shapes<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.259> small<00:06:39.560> shapes<00:06:39.919> you<00:06:40.490> start

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
big shapes the small shapes you start

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.510 
big shapes the small shapes you start
drawing<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.210> figure<00:06:41.360> like<00:06:41.750> it's<00:06:41.900> an

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
drawing the figure like it's an

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.640 
drawing the figure like it's an
unclothed<00:06:43.520> or<00:06:43.789> nude<00:06:43.940> figure<00:06:44.360> but<00:06:45.349> then<00:06:45.530> you

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
unclothed or nude figure but then you

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.249 
unclothed or nude figure but then you
basically<00:06:45.860> drape<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:46.669> material<00:06:47.090> over<00:06:47.360> it<00:06:47.449> so

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
basically drape the material over it so

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.350 
basically drape the material over it so
again<00:06:48.740> the<00:06:48.889> material<00:06:49.340> has<00:06:49.520> to<00:06:49.699> follow<00:06:49.880> form

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
again the material has to follow form

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.270 
again the material has to follow form
and<00:06:50.659> where<00:06:51.440> it's<00:06:51.560> being<00:06:51.680> pulled<00:06:51.949> down<00:06:52.099> by

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
and where it's being pulled down by

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.529 
and where it's being pulled down by
gravity<00:06:52.310> it<00:06:52.849> has<00:06:52.969> to<00:06:53.120> obey<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.330> laws<00:06:53.509> of

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
gravity it has to obey the laws of

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.779 
gravity it has to obey the laws of
gravity<00:06:54.080> okay<00:06:55.009> so<00:06:55.070> now<00:06:55.310> we're<00:06:55.430> going<00:06:55.550> to<00:06:55.610> do

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
gravity okay so now we're going to do

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.320 
gravity okay so now we're going to do
Dan's<00:06:56.570> going<00:06:56.719> to<00:06:56.810> do<00:06:57.400> well<00:06:58.400> the<00:06:58.849> quick<00:06:59.120> ones

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
Dan's going to do well the quick ones

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.370 
Dan's going to do well the quick ones
floors<00:06:59.630> and<00:07:01.750> it's<00:07:02.750> going<00:07:02.900> to<00:07:02.960> be<00:07:03.050> with<00:07:03.169> driver

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
floors and it's going to be with driver

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.039 
floors and it's going to be with driver
ok<00:07:03.710> then<00:07:03.860> cut
