opportunity to kind of beat you are you
used<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.650> it<00:00:24.740> I've<00:00:25.700> played<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.150> couple<00:00:26.300> of

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
used to it I've played it a couple of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.830 
used to it I've played it a couple of
times<00:00:26.540> this<00:00:27.440> is<00:00:27.530> the<00:00:27.590> first<00:00:27.800> time<00:00:27.950> oh<00:00:28.570> I<00:00:29.570> think

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
times this is the first time oh I think

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.600 
times this is the first time oh I think
it's<00:00:30.080> great<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.320> think<00:00:30.500> cows<00:00:30.800> masters<00:00:31.340> have

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
it's great I think cows masters have

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.180 
it's great I think cows masters have
done<00:00:31.910> a<00:00:32.119> super<00:00:32.509> job<00:00:32.540> actually<00:00:33.410> of<00:00:33.800> giving

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
done a super job actually of giving

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.020 
done a super job actually of giving
regular<00:00:35.179> people<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.719> proper<00:00:36.649> insight<00:00:37.070> into

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
regular people a proper insight into

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.310 
regular people a proper insight into
what<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.570> grand<00:00:38.929> prix<00:00:39.170> car<00:00:39.350> is<00:00:39.559> like<00:00:41.199> when<00:00:42.199> I<00:00:42.230> was

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
what a grand prix car is like when I was

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.930 
what a grand prix car is like when I was
practicing<00:00:42.769> on<00:00:42.859> the<00:00:42.949> sin<00:00:43.129> we<00:00:43.249> did<00:00:43.399> i'm<00:00:43.519> like<00:00:43.550> a

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
practicing on the sin we did i'm like a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.869 
practicing on the sin we did i'm like a
full<00:00:44.329> full<00:00:44.929> loaded<00:00:45.320> fuel<00:00:45.589> car<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.219> then<00:00:46.699> went

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
full full loaded fuel car and then went

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.250 
full full loaded fuel car and then went
straight<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.269> a<00:00:47.359> qualifying<00:00:47.809> car<00:00:48.019> and<00:00:48.140> their

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
straight to a qualifying car and their

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.989 
straight to a qualifying car and their
differences<00:00:48.829> unbelievable<00:00:49.550> but<00:00:49.699> it's<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
differences unbelievable but it's the

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.250 
differences unbelievable but it's the
same<00:00:50.149> one<00:00:50.329> you're<00:00:50.510> from<00:00:50.659> either<00:00:50.809> games<00:00:51.050> I've

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
same one you're from either games I've

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.259 
same one you're from either games I've
tried<00:00:51.499> it<00:00:51.679> I<00:00:51.920> went<00:00:52.309> from<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.550> road<00:00:52.760> car<00:00:53.030> at<00:00:53.239> a

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
tried it I went from a road car at a

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.660 
tried it I went from a road car at a
hundred<00:00:53.510> points<00:00:53.809> about<00:00:54.109> 200<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:54.979> member<00:00:55.370> put<00:00:55.550> my

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
hundred points about 200 I member put my

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.099 
hundred points about 200 I member put my
foot<00:00:55.850> down<00:00:55.879> thinking<00:00:56.300> I'll<00:00:56.420> never<00:00:56.690> be<00:00:56.870> able<00:00:56.960> to

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
foot down thinking I'll never be able to

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.649 
foot down thinking I'll never be able to
control<00:00:57.409> this<00:00:57.589> amount<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:57.979> power<00:00:58.249> so<00:00:59.030> then<00:00:59.600> you

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
control this amount of power so then you

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.419 
control this amount of power so then you
took<00:00:59.780> about<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.050> year<00:01:00.140> hundreds<00:01:00.679> very<00:01:01.010> yeah

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
took about a year hundreds very yeah

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.869 
took about a year hundreds very yeah
okay<00:01:01.760> yes<00:01:02.449> it's<00:01:03.379> actually<00:01:03.589> more<00:01:04.070> difficult<00:01:04.670> to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
okay yes it's actually more difficult to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.179 
okay yes it's actually more difficult to
get<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:05.510> precise<00:01:05.930> when<00:01:06.620> you're<00:01:06.770> doing<00:01:07.070> it

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
get it so precise when you're doing it

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.709 
get it so precise when you're doing it
in<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.310> simulator<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.149> when<00:01:08.329> you're<00:01:08.450> doing

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
in the simulator then when you're doing

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.399 
in the simulator then when you're doing
it<00:01:08.840> in

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.459 

actually<00:01:13.219> I<00:01:13.280> playing<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.030> lot<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:15.170> from<00:01:15.439> a

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
actually I playing a lot of from a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.260 
actually I playing a lot of from a
one-game<00:01:15.859> to<00:01:16.159> learn<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.520> tracks<00:01:16.850> took<00:01:17.149> a

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
one-game to learn the tracks took a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.160 
one-game to learn the tracks took a
little<00:01:17.509> bit<00:01:17.780> yet<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:19.340> feeling<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.909> track

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.959 

because<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.289> circuit<00:01:24.770> surveys<00:01:25.250> are<00:01:25.789> so

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
because the circuit surveys are so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.760 
because the circuit surveys are so
accurate<00:01:26.149> now<00:01:26.479> for<00:01:26.719> us<00:01:26.959> in<00:01:27.109> the<00:01:27.200> simulator<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
accurate now for us in the simulator and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.649 
accurate now for us in the simulator and
for<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.159> game<00:01:28.310> as<00:01:28.520> well<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.939> can<00:01:29.179> just<00:01:29.209> drive

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
for the game as well you can just drive

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.569 
for the game as well you can just drive
around<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.170> game<00:01:30.350> on<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.920> same<00:01:31.130> circuit

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
around in the game on the same circuit

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.770 
around in the game on the same circuit
you<00:01:31.670> won't<00:01:31.819> get<00:01:31.939> any<00:01:32.030> surprises<00:01:32.390> when<00:01:32.569> you

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
you won't get any surprises when you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.609 
you won't get any surprises when you
turn<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.289> won't<00:01:33.439> be<00:01:33.530> completely<00:01:33.890> different

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
turn up it won't be completely different

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.109 
turn up it won't be completely different
house<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.770> will<00:01:36.829> be<00:01:36.890> going<00:01:37.130> yeah<00:01:37.729> really<00:01:37.880> well

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
house it will be going yeah really well

the<00:01:41.810> car<00:01:41.990> how<00:01:42.200> close<00:01:42.530> were<00:01:42.709> we<00:01:42.950> did<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:43.429> it

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
the car how close were we did we get it

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.889 
the car how close were we did we get it
right<00:01:43.670> yeah<00:01:44.179> it's<00:01:44.299> actually<00:01:44.509> quite<00:01:44.599> funny

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
right yeah it's actually quite funny

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.240 
right yeah it's actually quite funny
because<00:01:45.079> when<00:01:45.289> I<00:01:45.500> was<00:01:45.619> playing<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.979> game<00:01:46.219> and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
because when I was playing the game and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.190 
because when I was playing the game and
that<00:01:46.549> wasn't<00:01:46.670> hot<00:01:47.000> before<00:01:47.360> your<00:01:47.509> 401<00:01:47.899> K<00:01:48.049> I

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
that wasn't hot before your 401 K I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.270 
that wasn't hot before your 401 K I
really<00:01:48.439> fought<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:48.739> a<00:01:48.799> little<00:01:48.950> bit<00:01:49.039> too<00:01:49.159> much

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
really fought it's a little bit too much

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.369 
really fought it's a little bit too much
like<00:01:49.459> an<00:01:49.610> arcade<00:01:49.939> game<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.360> or<00:01:50.929> something<00:01:51.259> like

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:51.379 
like an arcade game of or something like

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:52.839 
like an arcade game of or something like
that<00:01:51.439> but<00:01:51.770> now<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:51.979> really<00:01:52.280> have<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.429> say<00:01:52.520> it's
