overlapping blows now after I get the
shape<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.519> there<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.970> I'll<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.780> over<00:02:09.840> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
shape in there I want I'll go over to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.900 
shape in there I want I'll go over to
the<00:02:10.110> wheel<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.410> I'll<00:02:10.530> smooth<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> okay<00:02:11.700> let's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
the wheel and I'll smooth it okay let's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:55.679 
the wheel and I'll smooth it okay let's
get<00:02:12.030> started<00:02:12.300> here

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.440 

okay<00:02:57.609> if<00:02:58.609> we<00:02:58.730> look<00:02:58.879> at<00:02:58.969> the<00:02:59.060> surface<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.359> can

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
okay if we look at the surface you can

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.660 
okay if we look at the surface you can
see<00:02:59.659> I<00:02:59.689> do<00:02:59.810> have<00:02:59.840> some<00:03:00.109> lines<00:03:00.349> there's<00:03:01.040> lots<00:03:01.459> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
see I do have some lines there's lots of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.190 
see I do have some lines there's lots of
them<00:03:01.849> that<00:03:02.000> means<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.359> hit<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.569> made<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> lot<00:03:03.079> of

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
them that means I hit I made a lot of

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.190 
them that means I hit I made a lot of
overlapping<00:03:03.590> blows<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:05.540> shape<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.959> nice

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
overlapping blows the shape is a nice

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.959 
overlapping blows the shape is a nice
low<00:03:06.439> crown<00:03:06.709> shape<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.519> now<00:03:07.579> I'm<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.849> go

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969 
low crown shape and now I'm going to go

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.330 
low crown shape and now I'm going to go
over<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.299> wheel<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.010> got<00:03:10.129> a<00:03:10.159> low

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
over to the wheel and if we got a low

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.589 
over to the wheel and if we got a low
crown<00:03:10.549> wheel<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:10.909> here<00:03:11.000> now<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.239> I'm<00:03:11.329> gonna<00:03:11.420> go

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
crown wheel in here now and I'm gonna go

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.670 
crown wheel in here now and I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:11.689> and<00:03:11.870> smooth<00:03:12.109> it<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:14.409> yeah<00:03:15.409> I'll<00:03:15.530> get

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
ahead and smooth it up yeah I'll get

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.990 
ahead and smooth it up yeah I'll get
started<00:03:15.920> I'll<00:03:16.220> just<00:03:16.400> put<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:16.639> in<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> wheel

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
started I'll just put it in the wheel

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.920 
started I'll just put it in the wheel
bring<00:03:17.359> up<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.629> en<00:03:17.840> ville

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
bring up the en ville

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.000 
bring up the en ville
now<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.989> thing<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> remember<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:21.829> this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
now the thing to remember with this

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.300 
now the thing to remember with this
technique<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:23.290> blocking<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.439> in<00:03:24.530> saluting

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
technique is of blocking and in saluting

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.729 
technique is of blocking and in saluting
is<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:26.209> blocking<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.930> what<00:03:27.139> already<00:03:27.349> put

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
is that the blocking is what already put

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.559 
is that the blocking is what already put
the<00:03:27.859> shape<00:03:28.099> in<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.340> park<00:03:28.609> for<00:03:28.849> us<00:03:28.879> I<00:03:29.150> don't

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
the shape in the park for us I don't

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.959 
the shape in the park for us I don't
want<00:03:30.169> any<00:03:30.409> excess<00:03:30.889> wheel<00:03:31.129> pressure<00:03:31.459> here<00:03:31.760> I

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
want any excess wheel pressure here I

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.909 
want any excess wheel pressure here I
only<00:03:32.419> want<00:03:32.780> enough<00:03:32.930> pressure<00:03:33.139> to<00:03:33.349> smooth<00:03:33.650> out

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
only want enough pressure to smooth out

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.920 
only want enough pressure to smooth out
the<00:03:34.099> material<00:03:34.489> if<00:03:34.939> I<00:03:35.030> put<00:03:35.209> excess<00:03:35.510> pressure<00:03:35.750> in

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
the material if I put excess pressure in

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.839 
the material if I put excess pressure in
here<00:03:36.079> I'm<00:03:36.560> going<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.829> actually<00:03:37.459> change<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
here I'm going to actually change the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.069 
here I'm going to actually change the
shape<00:03:37.879> of<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.239> part<00:03:38.419> I'm<00:03:38.510> working<00:03:38.840> against

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
shape of the part I'm working against

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.440 
shape of the part I'm working against
myself<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.489> will<00:03:40.730> start<00:03:40.879> out<00:03:40.969> with<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.150> very

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
myself so I will start out with a very

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.699 
myself so I will start out with a very
very<00:03:41.540> light<00:03:41.930> setting<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.439> you're<00:03:42.530> going<00:03:42.650> to

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
very light setting and you're going to

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.339 
very light setting and you're going to
hear<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:43.159> clunk<00:03:43.790> clunk<00:03:44.239> noise<00:03:44.540> I'm<00:03:44.840> working<00:03:45.230> out

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
hear a clunk clunk noise I'm working out

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:57.690 
hear a clunk clunk noise I'm working out
the<00:03:45.500> bumps

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.920 

now<00:03:58.700> this<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:58.910> really<00:03:59.150> quite<00:03:59.330> loose<00:03:59.630> in<00:03:59.810> here

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
now this is really quite loose in here

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.320 
now this is really quite loose in here
in<00:04:00.050> spec<00:04:00.230> it's<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.590> loose<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.940> can<00:04:02.180> actually

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
in spec it's so loose and I can actually

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.530 
in spec it's so loose and I can actually
pull<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.810> out<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:04.040> idea<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.490> not<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:04.940> squeeze

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
pull it out the idea is not to squeeze

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.750 
pull it out the idea is not to squeeze
it<00:04:06.520> let's<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.610> work<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.330> bumps<00:04:08.600> out<00:04:09.760> now

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
it let's just work the bumps out now

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.500 
it let's just work the bumps out now
eventually<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.690> setting<00:04:12.050> hold<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.940> get<00:04:14.180> used

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
eventually the setting hold and get used

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.660 
eventually the setting hold and get used
up<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:14.960> I'll<00:04:15.080> need<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.350> put<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:16.070> little<00:04:16.340> bit

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
up and I'll need to put it a little bit

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:27.940 
up and I'll need to put it a little bit
tighter<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.920> work<00:04:25.160> progresses<00:04:26.950> the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
tighter as this work progresses the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.860 
tighter as this work progresses the
noise<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.820> wheel<00:04:29.000> makes<00:04:29.300> on<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.540> metal

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
noise that the wheel makes on the metal

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.050 
noise that the wheel makes on the metal
look<00:04:29.960> at<00:04:30.080> quieter<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.650> quieter<00:04:30.800> as<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.790> bumps

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
look at quieter and quieter as the bumps

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.090 
look at quieter and quieter as the bumps
will<00:04:32.210> have<00:04:32.300> worked<00:04:32.480> themselves<00:04:32.690> out<00:04:39.100> now

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
will have worked themselves out now

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.650 
will have worked themselves out now
you're<00:04:40.280> tracking<00:04:40.490> should<00:04:40.850> be<00:04:40.970> very<00:04:41.300> very

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
you're tracking should be very very

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.409 
you're tracking should be very very
close<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.320> tracking<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.490> what<00:04:43.669> we<00:04:43.790> call<00:04:44.000> moving

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
close a tracking is what we call moving

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.420 
close a tracking is what we call moving
the<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:45.320> movement<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.919> metal<00:04:46.190> through

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
the the movement of the metal through

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.589 
the the movement of the metal through
the<00:04:46.669> wheel

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.460 

see<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.379> difference<00:04:54.499> in<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.889> sound<00:04:55.129> already
