00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
color at least on me in my opinion

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.659 
color at least on me in my opinion
they're<00:04:47.150> very<00:04:47.389> similar<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.070> pink<00:04:49.070> pout<00:04:49.280> and

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
and all these colors remind me so much

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.750 
and all these colors remind me so much
of<00:04:59.090> each<00:04:59.330> other<00:04:59.479> this<00:05:00.110> here<00:05:00.590> I<00:05:00.740> think<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.729> just

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
of each other this here I think it just

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.360 
of each other this here I think it just
I<00:05:02.270> don't<00:05:02.389> know<00:05:02.570> why<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.289> reminds<00:05:03.860> me<00:05:04.010> of

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
I don't know why but it reminds me of

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.629 
I don't know why but it reminds me of
like<00:05:05.169> strawberry<00:05:06.169> shortcake<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:07.190> the
