well<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:22.670> reminds<00:02:23.030> me<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> little<00:02:23.360> bit<00:02:23.450> of

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
well it's reminds me a little bit of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.080 
well it's reminds me a little bit of
football<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.110> mean<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:24.440> want<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.890> level<00:02:25.849> playing

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
football I mean you want a level playing

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.580 
football I mean you want a level playing
field<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.569> want<00:02:26.750> rules<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.230> everybody

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
field and you want rules that everybody

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.160 
field and you want rules that everybody
understands<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.510> people<00:02:29.930> don't<00:02:30.019> get

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
understands so like people don't get

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.990 
understands so like people don't get
hurt<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> game<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.819> be<00:02:31.880> played

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
hurt so that the game can be played

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.790 
hurt so that the game can be played
fairly<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.720> mean<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.230> think<00:02:33.260> that's<00:02:33.620> what<00:02:33.769> we

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
fairly I mean I think that's what we

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400 
fairly I mean I think that's what we
need<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.099> go<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.450> what<00:02:35.750> you're<00:02:35.959> telling<00:02:36.260> me<00:02:36.290> is

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
need to go and what you're telling me is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.030 
need to go and what you're telling me is
that<00:02:36.670> once<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.819> get<00:02:37.940> those<00:02:38.180> sorts<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:38.989> rules<00:02:39.769> in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
that once we get those sorts of rules in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
that once we get those sorts of rules in
place<00:02:40.340> than<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.239> technology<00:02:41.989> ought<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.260> take

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
place than the technology ought to take

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.589 
place than the technology ought to take
off<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.099> absolutely<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.209> we<00:02:44.300> just<00:02:44.480> have

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
off is that absolutely and we just have

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.220 
off is that absolutely and we just have
to<00:02:44.720> look<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.709> when<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.519> was<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> child<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:48.080> had
