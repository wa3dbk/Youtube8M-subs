command now in the last video we looked

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.680 
command now in the last video we looked
at<00:00:21.039> the<00:00:21.160> general<00:00:21.490> commands<00:00:21.880> and<00:00:22.060> it<00:00:22.300> was<00:00:22.420> quite

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
at the general commands and it was quite

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.300 
at the general commands and it was quite
a<00:00:22.720> long<00:00:22.960> video<00:00:23.140> but<00:00:23.500> I<00:00:23.890> hope<00:00:24.039> it<00:00:24.189> was<00:00:24.279> helpful

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
a long video but I hope it was helpful

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
this video were you a little shorter as

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.310 
this video were you a little shorter as
we're<00:00:27.699> just<00:00:27.999> going<00:00:28.179> to<00:00:28.210> solve<00:00:28.449> dive<00:00:28.900> into

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
we're just going to solve dive into

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.710 
we're just going to solve dive into
school<00:00:29.769> boards<00:00:30.039> now<00:00:30.759> school<00:00:31.089> was<00:00:31.240> a<00:00:31.269> great

feature<00:00:32.020> added<00:00:32.439> in<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.030> snapshot<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.300> think<00:00:34.600> 13

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
feature added in the snapshot I think 13

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.690 
feature added in the snapshot I think 13
week<00:00:35.770> oh<00:00:36.010> for<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.590> they<00:00:38.590> basically<00:00:38.920> allow

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
week oh for a and they basically allow

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.970 
week oh for a and they basically allow
you<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:40.090> keep<00:00:40.300> track<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.840> what<00:00:41.440> player<00:00:41.770> is

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
you to keep track of what player is

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.950 
you to keep track of what player is
doing<00:00:42.250> in<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.430> game<00:00:42.670> assign<00:00:43.210> them<00:00:43.360> identities

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
doing in a game assign them identities

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.670 
doing in a game assign them identities
and<00:00:44.230> all<00:00:44.710> good<00:00:45.070> stuff<00:00:45.280> like<00:00:45.520> that<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:47.020> let's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
and all good stuff like that now let's

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.560 
and all good stuff like that now let's
have<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.920> look<00:00:48.010> at<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.580> objectives<00:00:49.150> which<00:00:49.450> is

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
have a look at the objectives which is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.320 
have a look at the objectives which is
where<00:00:49.840> we're<00:00:50.020> going<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.200> start<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.520> basically

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
where we're going to start so basically

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.070 
where we're going to start so basically
the<00:00:52.810> format<00:00:53.440> for<00:00:53.470> this<00:00:53.860> is<00:00:54.070> scoreboard<00:00:55.080> which

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
the format for this is scoreboard which

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.230 
the format for this is scoreboard which
the<00:00:56.110> command<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.890> they<00:00:57.250> use<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.580> sub<00:00:57.820> command

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
the command and they use the sub command

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.820 
the command and they use the sub command
of<00:00:58.510> objectives<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.410> the<00:01:00.010> sub<00:01:00.280> command<00:01:00.700> of<00:01:00.970> AD

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
of objectives and the sub command of AD

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.950 
of objectives and the sub command of AD
now<00:01:02.830> what<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.250> could<00:01:03.490> do<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.850> google<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.360> is

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
now what this could do is google it is

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.740 
now what this could do is google it is
it<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.740> oh<00:01:06.130> goodness<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.820> can't<00:01:07.000> speak<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.330> is

it it oh goodness I can't speak it is
going<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.350> create<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:09.009> new<00:01:09.790> objective<00:01:10.450> now<00:01:11.200> what

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
going to create a new objective now what

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.840 
going to create a new objective now what
we're<00:01:11.650> going<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.829> call<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.130> objective<00:01:12.670> is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
we're going to call this objective is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.149 
we're going to call this objective is
points<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:14.079> what<00:01:14.259> is<00:01:14.380> going<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.560> be<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:14.950> it's

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
points and what is going to be is it's

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.239 
points and what is going to be is it's
going<00:01:15.249> to<00:01:15.340> be<00:01:15.429> a<00:01:15.460> dummy<00:01:15.880> type<00:01:16.689> of<00:01:17.049> objective<00:01:17.679> so

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
going to be a dummy type of objective so

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.190 
going to be a dummy type of objective so
this<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.609> name<00:01:18.909> this<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:20.109> the<00:01:20.880> type<00:01:21.880> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this is the name this is the type and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770 
this is the name this is the type and
now<00:01:23.200> what<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.740> last<00:01:24.219> thing<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:24.969> it's<00:01:25.569> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
now what this last thing is is it's the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.599 
now what this last thing is is it's the
display<00:01:26.469> name<00:01:26.499> so<00:01:27.039> this<00:01:27.189> is<00:01:27.340> what<00:01:27.490> you

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
display name so this is what you

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.660 
display name so this is what you
actually<00:01:27.759> want<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.240> display<00:01:28.840> when<00:01:29.619> your<00:01:30.100> mom

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
displaying it fairly straightforward so

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.399 
displaying it fairly straightforward so
let's<00:01:33.729> go<00:01:33.850> ahead<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.119> click<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.569> as<00:01:34.929> you<00:01:35.319> can

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
let's go ahead and click that as you can

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.289 
let's go ahead and click that as you can
see<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:35.859> added<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.399> new<00:01:37.139> objective<00:01:38.789> so<00:01:39.789> now

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
see it's added a new objective so now

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.730 
see it's added a new objective so now
you<00:01:40.359> may<00:01:40.539> be<00:01:40.569> thinking<00:01:40.719> to<00:01:41.049> yourself<00:01:41.109> what's

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you may be thinking to yourself what's

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.789 
you may be thinking to yourself what's
the<00:01:41.979> point<00:01:42.249> of<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.700> dummy<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:44.350> what<00:01:44.649> is<00:01:44.770> it

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
the point of a dummy and well what is it

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.459 
the point of a dummy and well what is it
haven't<00:01:45.670> explained<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.179> so<00:01:46.329> what<00:01:47.139> it<00:01:47.259> really

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
haven't explained it so what it really

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.190 
haven't explained it so what it really
is<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.789> not<00:01:49.060> really<00:01:49.420> anything<00:01:49.810> it

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
is is it's not really anything it

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.959 
is is it's not really anything it
doesn't<00:01:50.469> increment<00:01:51.189> when<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.399> player<00:01:51.670> does

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
doesn't increment when a player does

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.609 
doesn't increment when a player does
something<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.590> basically<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.759> way<00:01:55.090> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
something it is basically just a way of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.469 
something it is basically just a way of
identifying<00:01:56.619> different<00:01:57.130> players<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.060> adding

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
identifying different players and adding

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.410 
identifying different players and adding
various<00:01:59.139> points<00:01:59.679> and<00:02:00.009> using<00:02:00.549> it<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.909> sort<00:02:01.389> of

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
various points and using it to sort of

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.120 
various points and using it to sort of
create<00:02:01.630> an<00:02:01.929> environment<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.619> can<00:02:02.649> better

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
create an environment you can better

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.699 
create an environment you can better
control<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:04.479> very<00:02:04.810> useful<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:05.499> don't

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
control it's very useful so don't

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.739 
control it's very useful so don't
underestimate<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.490> power<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:07.029> because<00:02:07.630> to

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
underestimate the power of it because to

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.290 
underestimate the power of it because to
be<00:02:07.840> fair<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.590> my<00:02:09.220> opinion<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.850> better<00:02:10.090> than

be fair it in my opinion is better than

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.610 
be fair it in my opinion is better than
the<00:02:10.450> rest<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> types<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.350> we're<00:02:11.530> going

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
the rest of the types that we're going

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.410 
the rest of the types that we're going
to<00:02:11.709> look<00:02:11.830> at<00:02:11.980> but<00:02:12.700> let's<00:02:12.850> go<00:02:13.000> ahead<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.180> look

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
to look at but let's go ahead and look

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.630 
to look at but let's go ahead and look
at<00:02:13.540> them<00:02:13.690> anyway<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.830> are<00:02:14.860> few<00:02:15.190> other<00:02:15.220> types

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
at them anyway there are few other types

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.309 
at them anyway there are few other types
there's<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> total<00:02:16.599> kill<00:02:16.810> count<00:02:17.049> which<00:02:17.290> is

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
there's the total kill count which is

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.309 
there's the total kill count which is
fairly<00:02:18.280> selfish<00:02:18.670> Patrick<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.510> player<00:02:19.930> kill

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
fairly selfish Patrick the player kill

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.110 
fairly selfish Patrick the player kill
count<00:02:20.620> which<00:02:21.400> will

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
count which will

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.640 
count which will
increment<00:02:22.510> with<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> amount<00:02:23.019> of<00:02:23.230> players

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
increment with the amount of players

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.369 
increment with the amount of players
that<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.069> kill<00:02:24.280> specifically<00:02:25.209> again<00:02:25.870> fairly

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
that you kill specifically again fairly

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.670 
that you kill specifically again fairly
straightforward<00:02:26.950> there's<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.940> health<00:02:28.680> count

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
straightforward there's the health count

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.180 
straightforward there's the health count
I<00:02:30.040> suppose<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:32.230> really<00:02:32.470> account<00:02:32.830> it's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
I suppose it's not really account it's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.699 
I suppose it's not really account it's
the<00:02:33.700> amount<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.390> health<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.900> player<00:02:35.170> has<00:02:35.379> it's

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
the amount of health a player has it's

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.280 
the amount of health a player has it's
more<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.099> saw<00:02:36.250> nice<00:02:36.909> aesthetic<00:02:37.540> thing<00:02:38.019> it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
more of a saw nice aesthetic thing it's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.130 
more of a saw nice aesthetic thing it's
not<00:02:38.409> really<00:02:39.010> very<00:02:39.879> useful<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.870> nice<00:02:41.110> to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
not really very useful it's just nice to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.319 
not really very useful it's just nice to
sort<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.769> able<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.040> see<00:02:42.370> how<00:02:42.849> much<00:02:43.060> health

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
sort of be able to see how much health

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.920 
sort of be able to see how much health
players<00:02:43.690> have<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:45.390> well<00:02:46.390> we'll<00:02:46.599> get<00:02:46.780> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
players have and it's well we'll get to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.809 
players have and it's well we'll get to
it<00:02:47.049> in<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.260> bit<00:02:47.440> let's<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.040> leave<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
it in a bit let's just leave it for the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.199 
it in a bit let's just leave it for the
time<00:02:49.030> being<00:02:50.069> there's<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.220> death<00:02:51.430> count<00:02:51.670> again

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
time being there's the death count again

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.050 
time being there's the death count again
very<00:02:52.540> self-explanatory<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.579> there's<00:02:54.579> this

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
very self-explanatory and there's this

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.449 
very self-explanatory and there's this
command<00:02:55.540> here<00:02:55.870> which<00:02:56.500> uses<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> bit<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.400> a

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
command here which uses a bit of a

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.599 
command here which uses a bit of a
different<00:02:57.819> sub<00:02:58.660> command<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.620> doesn't<00:03:00.310> use<00:03:00.459> ad

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
different sub command it doesn't use ad

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.229 
different sub command it doesn't use ad
it<00:03:01.030> uses<00:03:01.359> remove<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.319> can<00:03:02.440> be<00:03:02.470> used<00:03:02.829> to

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
it uses remove and it can be used to

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.580 
it uses remove and it can be used to
well<00:03:04.239> remove<00:03:05.579> very<00:03:06.579> self-explanatory<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.290> if

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
well remove very self-explanatory so if

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.460 
well remove very self-explanatory so if
we<00:03:08.739> go<00:03:08.890> ahead<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.340> we<00:03:09.430> actually<00:03:10.359> click<00:03:11.049> some

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
we go ahead and we actually click some

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.220 
we go ahead and we actually click some
of<00:03:11.560> these<00:03:11.650> buttons<00:03:11.950> let's<00:03:12.370> go<00:03:12.609> ahead<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.000> just

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
of these buttons let's go ahead and just

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.039 
of these buttons let's go ahead and just
create<00:03:14.230> all<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.560> objectives<00:03:15.900> we've<00:03:16.900> got

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
create all the objectives we've got

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.680 
create all the objectives we've got
deaths<00:03:17.409> in<00:03:17.709> here<00:03:17.950> we've<00:03:18.159> created<00:03:18.489> deaths<00:03:18.940> by

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
deaths in here we've created deaths by

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.539 
deaths in here we've created deaths by
using<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:20.049> command<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:20.769> can<00:03:20.920> remove<00:03:21.190> debts

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
using this command we can remove debts

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.339 
using this command we can remove debts
and<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.359> will<00:03:22.510> take<00:03:22.720> away<00:03:22.870> all<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
and that will take away all the

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.710 
and that will take away all the
properties<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.950> deaths<00:03:24.220> had<00:03:24.579> all<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.420> kills

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
properties the deaths had all the kills

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.659 
properties the deaths had all the kills
all<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.470> deaths<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.859> anybody<00:03:27.220> had<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.579> will

all the deaths that anybody had it will

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.059 
all the deaths that anybody had it will
completely<00:03:27.970> reset<00:03:28.569> it<00:03:28.690> no<00:03:29.169> longer<00:03:29.319> exists<00:03:29.950> as
