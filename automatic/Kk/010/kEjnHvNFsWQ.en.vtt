well<00:00:01.439> at<00:00:01.709> week<00:00:01.979> for<00:00:02.449> body<00:00:03.449> isolations

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
well at week for body isolations

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.720 
well at week for body isolations
my<00:00:05.520> age<00:00:05.790> relations<00:00:06.240> are<00:00:06.480> super<00:00:07.230> important<00:00:07.920> the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
my age relations are super important the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.650 
my age relations are super important the
reason<00:00:09.270> is<00:00:09.799> most<00:00:10.799> people<00:00:11.430> don't<00:00:12.120> want<00:00:12.600> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
reason is most people don't want to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.379 
reason is most people don't want to
watch<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.230> dance<00:00:13.379> with<00:00:14.219> your<00:00:14.400> hands<00:00:15.090> and<00:00:15.270> your

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
watch you dance with your hands and your

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.740 
watch you dance with your hands and your
feet

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.380 

look<00:00:18.750> great<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.670> reason<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.210> doesn't

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
look great I think the reason it doesn't

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.040 
look great I think the reason it doesn't
look<00:00:21.600> great<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.289> people<00:00:22.770> consider<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.180> center

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
look great is people consider the center

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.999 
look great is people consider the center
of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.470> body<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:27.390> primary<00:00:27.860> part<00:00:28.860> of

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
of the body to be the primary part of

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.400 
of the body to be the primary part of
the<00:00:29.160> body<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.669> all<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.390> stuff<00:00:30.509> outside<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the body and all this stuff outside to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100 
the body and all this stuff outside to
be<00:00:31.500> sort<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> secondary<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
be sort of secondary to that so the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.610 
be sort of secondary to that so the
movements<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.850> middle<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.900> body<00:00:37.260> are

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
movements of the middle of the body are

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.850 
movements of the middle of the body are
what<00:00:38.550> did<00:00:38.730> look<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.150> I<00:00:39.720> think<00:00:40.199> to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> human

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
what did look good I think to the human

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.880 
what did look good I think to the human
eye<00:00:41.059> also<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.510> want<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> coordinate<00:00:43.260> from<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
eye also we want to coordinate from the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.540 
eye also we want to coordinate from the
middle<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.339> body

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
middle of the body

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.880 
middle of the body
movements<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.300> then<00:00:46.540> go<00:00:46.780> out<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.410> the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
movements that then go out to the

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.250 
movements that then go out to the
antenna<00:00:48.160> bodies

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.730 

then<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:52.070> put<00:00:52.370> my<00:00:52.489> hands<00:00:52.940> out

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
then I put my hands out

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
then I put my hands out
instead<00:00:54.490> of<00:00:54.520> just<00:00:54.790> but<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.480> ends<00:00:55.960> up<00:00:56.080> I<00:00:56.770> think

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
instead of just but it ends up I think

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.140 
instead of just but it ends up I think
that<00:00:58.120> is<00:00:58.540> what<00:00:58.990> makes<00:00:59.260> things<00:00:59.560> look<00:01:00.150> better

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
that is what makes things look better

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.570 
that is what makes things look better
it's<00:01:01.990> moving<00:01:02.410> first<00:01:02.740> from<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.040> center<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.490> the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
it's moving first from the center of the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.020 
it's moving first from the center of the
body

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
body

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.800 
body
ripple<00:01:05.420> out<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:06.049> the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
ripple out to the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.100 
ripple out to the
so<00:01:08.670> learn<00:01:09.670> how<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:09.939> move<00:01:10.119> all<00:01:10.240> these<00:01:10.329> pieces<00:01:10.509> so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
so learn how to move all these pieces so

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.929 
so learn how to move all these pieces so
you<00:01:11.290> can<00:01:11.439> isolate<00:01:11.950> any<00:01:12.189> part<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.640> body<00:01:12.729> you

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
you can isolate any part of the body you

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.620 
you can isolate any part of the body you
could<00:01:13.149> isolate<00:01:13.450> your<00:01:14.110> head

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
could isolate your head

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.959 
could isolate your head
you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.079> isolate<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.740> shoulder<00:01:17.219> movement

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
you can isolate your shoulder movement

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.270 
you can isolate your shoulder movement
and<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> practice<00:01:19.079> all<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.130> those

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and it's good to practice all of those

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
and it's good to practice all of those
isolations<00:01:20.789> so<00:01:21.719> practice<00:01:22.200> moving<00:01:22.409> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
isolations so practice moving your

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.780 
isolations so practice moving your
shoulders<00:01:22.950> forward

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.810 

your<00:01:33.540> shoulders

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 

her<00:01:45.540> super<00:01:46.110> mobile<00:01:46.350> part<00:01:47.010> of<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.190> body<00:01:47.370> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
her super mobile part of the body so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
her super mobile part of the body so
it's<00:01:47.760> good<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:47.940> get<00:01:48.120> all<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> them<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.350> think

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's good to get all of them and think

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's good to get all of them and think
of<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.550> it<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.180> they're<00:01:51.480> doing<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.650> then

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
of what it is that they're doing so then

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
of what it is that they're doing so then
when<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.250> dancing<00:01:53.400> you're<00:01:53.670> aware<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.270> them

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
when you're dancing you're aware of them

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.760 
when you're dancing you're aware of them
and<00:01:55.290> they're<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.950> moving<00:01:56.400> without<00:01:57.770> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and they're not moving without you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
and they're not moving without you
wanting<00:01:59.220> them<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> them

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
wanting them to them

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.030 
wanting them to them
can<00:02:01.320> practice<00:02:01.950> isolating<00:02:02.580> your<00:02:02.939> shoulders

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
can practice isolating your shoulders

feels kind of stuck and Travis
yes<00:03:05.780> some<00:03:06.780> people<00:03:06.810> will

what<00:05:24.610> not<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.360> need<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.540> start<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.990> combine

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
what not so you need to start to combine

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.879 
what not so you need to start to combine
the<00:05:26.440> isolation<00:05:27.310> so<00:05:27.580> they<00:05:27.820> were

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.909 

the<00:05:31.180> layering<00:05:32.180> of<00:05:32.749> strength<00:05:33.110> locations<00:05:33.620> that

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
the layering of strength locations that

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:40.230 
the layering of strength locations that
we<00:05:34.009> talked<00:05:34.249> about<00:05:34.400> before<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.719> it<00:05:36.169> when<00:05:36.439> were

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.460 

following<00:05:41.240> tell<00:05:41.630> me

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.270 

so<00:05:45.470> all<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.710> these

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
so all of these

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.340 
so all of these
together<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.419> that's<00:05:49.570> that's<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:50.169> hip

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
together so that's that's a hip

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.110 
together so that's that's a hip
isolation<00:05:50.919> right<00:05:51.070> there<00:05:51.340> I'm<00:05:51.550> moving<00:05:51.880> my<00:05:51.910> hips

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
isolation right there I'm moving my hips

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.380

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210
