concealer and I am very kind of harsh on

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
concealer and I am very kind of harsh on
under-eye<00:01:10.799> concealers<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.909> have

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
under-eye concealers because I do have

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.890 
under-eye concealers because I do have
very<00:01:12.450> dark<00:01:12.720> circles<00:01:13.909> unfortunately<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.630> one

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
very dark circles unfortunately this one

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
very dark circles unfortunately this one
is<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.380> favorite<00:01:17.040> however<00:01:18.380> if<00:01:19.580> you're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
is not my favorite however if you're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.929 
is not my favorite however if you're
dark<00:01:20.970> circling<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.110> bad<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.680> mine<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
dark circling is not as bad as mine you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.740 
dark circling is not as bad as mine you
probably<00:01:24.570> could<00:01:25.820> get<00:01:26.820> away<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.240> using<00:01:27.450> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
probably could get away with using this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
probably could get away with using this
without<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> corrector<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> use

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
without a corrector like I have to use

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
without a corrector like I have to use
and<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:32.850> look<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> has<00:01:34.020> got

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and it will look good because it has got

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.990 
and it will look good because it has got
that<00:01:34.439> Sheen<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.770> might<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.759> set<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that Sheen you might not have to set it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.870 
that Sheen you might not have to set it
depending<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:37.100> many<00:01:38.100> fine<00:01:38.460> lines<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
if it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.890 
if it
to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.709> hype<00:02:14.189> purchase<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.299> kit

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to the hype purchase it for my kit

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
to the hype purchase it for my kit
another<00:02:16.500> downfall<00:02:17.010> about<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.879> cost

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
another downfall about this is the cost

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.240 
another downfall about this is the cost
it<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.510> expensive<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.650> will<00:02:19.799> put<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> cost

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it is expensive and I will put the cost

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.660 
it is expensive and I will put the cost
right<00:02:20.489> here<00:02:21.709> color<00:02:22.709> selection<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.400> think

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
right here color selection I think

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.369 
right here color selection I think
there's<00:02:23.849> only<00:02:23.939> three<00:02:24.359> colors<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:24.900> choose<00:02:25.079> from

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
there's only three colors to choose from

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.839 
there's only three colors to choose from
and<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:25.620> try<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.950> make<00:02:26.159> it<00:02:26.310> seem<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:26.670> it's

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
and they try to make it seem like it's

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.339 
and they try to make it seem like it's
Universal<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.629> they<00:02:27.750> don't<00:02:27.930> need<00:02:28.109> more

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
Universal and they don't need more

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.330 
Universal and they don't need more
shades<00:02:28.680> than<00:02:28.920> three<00:02:30.109> no<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.920> need<00:02:32.129> more

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
shades than three no you need more

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.990 
shades than three no you need more
shades<00:02:32.579> than<00:02:32.819> three<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.609> going<00:02:35.879> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
shades than three it's just not going to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.119 
shades than three it's just not going to
work<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.329> everybody<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.959> think<00:02:37.290> maybe<00:02:37.560> if

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
work for everybody and I think maybe if

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.699 
work for everybody and I think maybe if
this<00:02:38.879> shade<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> little<00:02:39.840> bit<00:02:39.989> lighter<00:02:42.709> than

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
this shade was a little bit lighter than

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.910 
this shade was a little bit lighter than
it<00:02:43.829> might<00:02:44.010> work<00:02:44.310> well<00:02:44.609> for<00:02:44.969> me<00:02:45.150> under<00:02:45.920> work

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it might work well for me under work

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.530 
it might work well for me under work
better<00:02:47.129> for<00:02:47.489> me<00:02:47.670> maybe<00:02:47.879> have<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.420> bit

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
better for me maybe have a little bit

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.280 
better for me maybe have a little bit
more<00:02:48.689> beige<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.760> because<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.909> it<00:02:51.569> tries<00:02:52.049> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
more beige in it because it it tries to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.409 
more beige in it because it it tries to
promote<00:02:52.739> itself<00:02:53.159> as<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> corrector<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.239> my

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
promote itself as a corrector like my

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.059 
promote itself as a corrector like my
Yves<00:02:54.599> pearl<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.319> doesn't<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:55.889> good<00:02:56.010> of

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
Yves pearl but it doesn't do as good of

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.360 
Yves pearl but it doesn't do as good of
a<00:02:56.250> job<00:02:57.109> so<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.139> got<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.500> use<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:58.829> a<00:02:58.859> concealer

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
a job so I got to use it as a concealer

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.339 
a job so I got to use it as a concealer
and<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.000> color<00:03:00.269> isn't<00:03:00.510> quite<00:03:00.870> right<00:03:01.019> for<00:03:01.079> me

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
and the color isn't quite right for me

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.020 
and the color isn't quite right for me
as<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.500> concealer<00:03:01.919> so<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.340> kind<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.639> stuck<00:03:03.000> in

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
as a concealer so it's kind of stuck in

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.940 
as a concealer so it's kind of stuck in
this<00:03:03.299> no-man's<00:03:03.870> land<00:03:04.159> so<00:03:05.159> yeah<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:07.590> me<00:03:07.739> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
this no-man's land so yeah for me this

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.860 
this no-man's land so yeah for me this
did<00:03:08.159> not<00:03:08.280> work<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> good<00:03:10.169> consistency<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
did not work it is a good consistency I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.659 
did not work it is a good consistency I
would<00:03:12.870> think<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.230> pot<00:03:13.530> would<00:03:13.799> last<00:03:14.040> forever

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
would think this pot would last forever

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.530 
would think this pot would last forever
because<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:16.040> how<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.340> product<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.209> don't

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
because of how this product is you don't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
because of how this product is you don't
use<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> whole<00:03:19.530> lot<00:03:19.560> at<00:03:19.949> one<00:03:20.159> time<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:24.000> it's

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
use a whole lot at one time but it's

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.770 
use a whole lot at one time but it's
just<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.870> didn't<00:03:25.319> work<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.729> for<00:03:27.030> me<00:03:27.090> so

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
just it didn't work that well for me so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.569 
just it didn't work that well for me so
if<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> want<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.199> see<00:03:28.349> how<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.620> applies<00:03:29.010> then

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
if you want to see how this applies then

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.490 
if you want to see how this applies then
just<00:03:29.790> keep<00:03:29.940> watching<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:30.989> was<00:03:31.139> hoping<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
just keep watching so I was hoping that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.770 
just keep watching so I was hoping that
this<00:03:31.709> would<00:03:31.889> kind<00:03:32.099> of<00:03:32.190> act<00:03:32.430> as<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.150> corrector

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
this would kind of act as a corrector

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.270 
this would kind of act as a corrector
and<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.959> thought<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.530> would<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:34.829> it's<00:03:34.979> not<00:03:35.250> a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
and I thought it would but it's not a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.449 
and I thought it would but it's not a
very<00:03:35.639> good<00:03:35.940> corrector<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.379> as<00:03:37.889> you<00:03:38.129> can<00:03:38.280> see

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
very good corrector so as you can see

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.250 
very good corrector so as you can see
