00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you're simply going to rotate around so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.200 
you're simply going to rotate around so
that<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:49.320> feel<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> weight

pain and as you do these more and more
you'll<00:02:21.190> realize<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.819> your<00:02:22.830> usable<00:02:23.830> range<00:02:24.099> of

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
you'll realize that your usable range of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.850 
you'll realize that your usable range of
motion<00:02:24.790> increases<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.349> turn<00:02:26.560> your

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
motion increases and you can turn your

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.900 
motion increases and you can turn your
hands<00:02:27.310> further<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.910> further<00:02:28.060> inward<00:02:28.390> and
