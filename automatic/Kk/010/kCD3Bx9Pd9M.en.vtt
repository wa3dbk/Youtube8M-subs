00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
not disrupt the alignment because we're

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
not disrupt the alignment because we're
just<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.910> screws<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.629> back<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
just gonna put screws right back in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.220 
just gonna put screws right back in
these<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.649> holes<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.539> the<00:01:00.539> final<00:01:01.050> one

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
these little holes and the final one

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.109 
these little holes and the final one
which<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:04.610> now<00:01:07.790> I'm<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:09.090> sure

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
which is right there now I'm not sure

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
which is right there now I'm not sure
you<00:01:09.780> actually<00:01:09.930> need<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> use<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.740> ones<00:01:11.010> but

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you actually need to use these ones but

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.690 
you actually need to use these ones but
I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.570> scooch<00:01:13.170> longer<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I think they are just a scooch longer so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.820 
I think they are just a scooch longer so
we<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> manufacturer

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
we are going to do as the manufacturer

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.320 
we are going to do as the manufacturer
recommends<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:19.439> those<00:01:19.770> five<00:01:20.130> screws<00:01:20.610> one

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
recommends and use those five screws one

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.060 
recommends and use those five screws one
of<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.600> things<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> others

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
of these things is not like the others

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.630 
of these things is not like the others
one<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.700> slightly<00:01:24.659> longer<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.430> go

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
one is slightly longer that's gonna go

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.340 
one is slightly longer that's gonna go
up<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.000> we're<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.229> line<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
up there we're going to line up the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.609 
up there we're going to line up the
backplate<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:32.490> its<00:01:32.700> position<00:01:33.439> just<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
backplate in its position just get a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.460 
backplate in its position just get a
nice<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.189> over<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> holes<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> you'll

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
nice right over the holes and you'll

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
nice right over the holes and you'll
notice<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.119> some

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
notice you will get some you know some

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
notice you will get some you know some
performance<00:01:39.930> benefit<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.500> putting<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
performance benefit out of putting this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.499 
performance benefit out of putting this
on<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.640> thermal<00:01:42.030> pads<00:01:42.240> back

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
on because there are thermal pads back

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.160 
on because there are thermal pads back
here<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> chips<00:01:44.750> nothing<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> take<00:01:45.990> off

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
here for the chips nothing to take off

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.069 
here for the chips nothing to take off
on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> thermal<00:01:46.740> pads<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.369> come<00:01:47.549> pre<00:01:48.079> D

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
on the thermal pads they just come pre D

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.460 
on the thermal pads they just come pre D
taped<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.829> guess<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:50.909> say<00:01:51.229> start<00:01:52.229> in

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
taped I guess as you would say start in

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.670 
taped I guess as you would say start in
one<00:01:52.680> corner<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.869> nice<00:01:58.049> thing<00:01:58.079> here<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
one corner so the nice thing here and of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
one corner so the nice thing here and of
course<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> extremely<00:01:59.549> hard<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> see

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
course this is extremely hard to see

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310 
course this is extremely hard to see
because<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.450> trying<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.010 
careful
just<00:02:12.720> barely

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
just barely

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.370 
just barely
tight<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:15.390> mean<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.630> don't<00:02:16.720> want<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.080> come<00:02:17.230> off

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
tight I mean you don't want to come off

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.110 
tight I mean you don't want to come off
but<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.070> those<00:02:18.250> thermal<00:02:18.610> pads<00:02:18.880> will

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
but you know those thermal pads will

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.010 
but you know those thermal pads will
actually<00:02:19.540> help<00:02:20.290> hold<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.710> in<00:02:20.800> place<00:02:20.860> as<00:02:21.280> well

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
actually help hold it in place as well

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.210 
actually help hold it in place as well
and<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.170> don't<00:02:23.320> want<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.500> blower<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.890> rattle

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
and you don't want the blower to rattle

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.450 
and you don't want the blower to rattle
obviously<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:26.260> does<00:02:26.500> these<00:02:26.920> screws<00:02:27.280> do

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
obviously so this does these screws do

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.180 
obviously so this does these screws do
