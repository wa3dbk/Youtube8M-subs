 hi youtube i am anime aspire and this 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.709
 new video is to teach them to 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.530
 download microsoft windows xp 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.660
 professional service pack 3 Original the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.029
 links will be by mediafire and I know 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
 I will leave in the description without further delay 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.660
 let's start 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 are three links and are uploaded by 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.250
 you can find them in the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.250
 description of the video 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.920
 as you can see they are working 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.920
 correctly 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.500
 Once downloaded, we will have three 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.449
 files in avi format this is for 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.129
 cheat mediafire and do not erase me 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 so fast the system links 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.870
 operative you will wonder how 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.500
 decompress these files because there they 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.500
 the trick goes 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.650
 first here in the folder we're going 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.690
 here to organize in this corner 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.650
 and then we go to options 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.650
 folder and search 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 then in the section to see 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.900
 here we look for the option that says hide 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.970
 file extensions for types 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.450
 of known files and we take away the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.450
 selection 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.550
 and we give in applying and accepting 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.439
 then we will output the avi format what 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 let's do is change by the format 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.060
 as you will see below 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.870
 when we change the name we will go to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.560
 this table we only give in and 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.560
 we continue 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.110
 already changing the format we selected 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.350
 the three files and we give in extracting 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.350
 here 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.820
 will ask us for the password that I 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.590
 They will ask for a personal message to 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.010
 protection and so that I do not steal 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 links 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.840
 once finished extracting the file 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.150
 what will remain will also come in point 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 and now we will change it for the format 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.080
 iso point 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.170
 Now we can do a test with the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.170
 virtual pc or with another program 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.350
 in this case I will show you that if 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.350
 it works I'll show it with the virtual pc 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.070
