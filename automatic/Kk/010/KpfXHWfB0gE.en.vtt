00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
know there's always risks there's always

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.580 
know there's always risks there's always
be<00:02:04.420> if<00:02:04.540> there's<00:02:04.720> always<00:02:05.050> tension<00:02:05.290> that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
be if there's always tension that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.220
