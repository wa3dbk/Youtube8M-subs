00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.090
 the hungry moving average said key to the biodiversity of the earth and in league 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.990
 In an art gallery and a writing workshop, criteria has incentivized the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.990
 movement that generates certain class 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.050
 will not be heard percent in May and is a complicated to continue to leave 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.230
 from an image of a photo 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.230
 estate 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.349
 so look at the intensive therapy part 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.090
 through the data of the person before a photo for example that the data 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.629
 and in the vicinity 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:37.829
 in the an 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
 on the main screen with a database to see what impediments there between 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 the goals you want to achieve whether personal or 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.190
 of the class that they are with chile 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.730
 as often as there is a database 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.440
 in these meetings I will be an example 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.650
 so you can see how it's done 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.950
 is for example the one that they put the so many 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.680
 Russia 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.810
 towers 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.160
 the league 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 I would never say 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.800
 apart we have 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 low and then good for example quoted a month 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.090
 Magazine 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.450
 britos the card this card can be changed as background also for 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.660
 to induce them to 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.550
 the fifth card is very successful 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.000
 and then to see also 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.299
 can also produce data from the gallery adn 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 in that sense also 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.150
 to be very successful 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.780
 so now let's put a picture of the gallery 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 you could also have put a toni nadal photo 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.150
 and with the pictures 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.490
 speaker 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.469
 yes 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.499
 they know at the table too 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.259
 then the fifth 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.360
 let's do 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 a treatment according to information for example you can incentivize you 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.009
 You said you had to do exhibitions if you do exhibitions then 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
 we are going to do a treatment for 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.609
 actress position 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.189
 The exhibition 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 of the pictures 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:26.509
 the 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.359
 brasilia 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.549
 he said I accepted 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 from the club if she 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.939
 London 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.489
 I am 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.389
 for example spread a lot of interest 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.649
 100% 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.209
 much 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.119
 we are not interested 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.769
 of the phrase produce part of a sentence would be orange what we are going to put the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.969
 that you have once an affirmation arrives 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.519
 I see a sidewalk is complete 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.959
 and we repeat the level title again 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.349
 exposition 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.499
 Brussels 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.659
 of a beauty efe 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.459
 finally 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 nor in artists jamaica 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.499
 dioxin 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.589
 towers 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:21.729
 wake up 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.179
 wake up a lot 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.559
 intervention 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.999
 i 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.399
 has merit 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.619
 many times 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.059
 fluence been enough 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 public 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.099
 quilmes 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.479
 Many 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.529
 the success 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.579
 Is this what we want 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.840
 at the time it happens it does not matter we do not make it present whenever 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.969
 they work through the president 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.349
 then ee for example n let's go to 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.950
 to put here the customs again the entrance 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:13.779
 they do not forgive us 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:16.409
 the power 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.879
 and for example here we can introduce pictures 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.879
 let's introduce a box here 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270
 for example 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.539
 we go 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.069
 to put here 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.069
 anti-corruption 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 before such 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 phillips 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.389
 soon 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.849
 in this film 4 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.400
 3 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.990
 3 1 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 success 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.409
 Mexico - a quarter 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.559
 they have fun 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.559
 angel nonetheless with djokovic 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.580
 in this site 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.580
 picture 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.770
 I surrender 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.770
 since then the cmx and power 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:41.280
 the town of Arevalo and they stopped them at point blank range 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.560
 so 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.349
 let's add him haiti 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.330
 it is not common to see it 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.569
 So, I say, I think we're going to arrive with chances. 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.469
 the universal tried to do what he has to do 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.219
 let's put another one 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.330
 nor in what we are going to put ponies in the same way we do another another sheet of treatment 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.439
 with others more 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.979
 percent 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.650
 the teide for example to venezuela and that perhaps of tenerife this 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.429
 although the olympiacos way to return the money 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.279
 anyway 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.539
 picture 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.919
 in this joust 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.919
 eccio 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.819
 jbs 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.110
 and here for example we put something that they mix with Romania 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.529
 so that you do not 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:38.869
 praying 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:40.330
 in harmony 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.289
 for example the tÃ³pix added in symbol 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:44.849
 then the tone 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:47.319
 now I feel to do 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.319
 I do not know what not 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.969
 michetti praises through 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.949
 of the triangle 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.379
 the 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:00.559
 the princess 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:03.369
 we carry a 0 8% gil 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:06.369
 from another side 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:09.320
 the net
