especially even me I'm in playing
Minecraft<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> while<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> never<00:01:00.449> knew

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
Minecraft for a while and I never knew

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
Minecraft for a while and I never knew
that<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:01.109> golden<00:01:01.739> sword<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.190> worse<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that a golden sword was worse than a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
that a golden sword was worse than a
wooden<00:01:03.030> sword<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.250> sort<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.110> now<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> know

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
wooden sword so it sort and now I know

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
wooden sword so it sort and now I know
that<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.010> new<00:01:08.220> players<00:01:08.460> wouldn't<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.180> get

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that so new players wouldn't really get

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
that so new players wouldn't really get
hints<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.200> upset<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.040> didn't<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
