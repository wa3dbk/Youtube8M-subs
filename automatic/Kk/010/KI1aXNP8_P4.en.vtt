00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
thing not probably it is the biggest

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.160 
thing not probably it is the biggest
thing<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.730> Metro<00:00:45.210> UI<00:00:45.420> no<00:00:45.809> no<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:45.989> guys

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
thing is the Metro UI no no you guys

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
thing is the Metro UI no no you guys
have<00:00:46.350> been<00:00:46.379> coming<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.920> OS<00:00:47.340> 10<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:48.059> did<00:00:48.210> your

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
have been coming from OS 10 or did your

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.690 
have been coming from OS 10 or did your
thoughts<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.870> metro<00:00:49.289> UI<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
thoughts on metro UI and what do you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.270 
thoughts on metro UI and what do you
think<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.059> brings<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.539> windows<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
think it really brings to windows so I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.610 
think it really brings to windows so I
think<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.789> really<00:00:53.820> brings<00:00:54.300> another<00:00:54.840> factor<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
think it really brings another factor to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
think it really brings another factor to
Windows<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.910> having<00:00:57.480> two

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
Windows it kind of is like having two

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
Windows it kind of is like having two
os's<00:00:58.140> even<00:00:58.859> though<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
os's even though you know it's not I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
os's even though you know it's not I
think<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> gives<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> use<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> tablet

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
think it gives a lot of use for a tablet

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
think it gives a lot of use for a tablet
and<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> main<00:01:03.510> thing<00:01:03.539> i<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.199> see

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and that's the main thing i really see

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.260 
and that's the main thing i really see
going<00:01:04.650> towards<00:01:05.159> metro<00:01:05.580> UI<00:01:05.880> i<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
going towards metro UI i think it's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
going towards metro UI i think it's
going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> great<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.200> tablets<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
going to really be great on tablets on

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.289 
going to really be great on tablets on
the<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> desktop<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.210> bit

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the look on the desktop a little bit

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
the look on the desktop a little bit
awkward<00:01:09.720> still<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.680> it'll<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.010> wall

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
awkward still but I think it'll get wall

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.320 
awkward still but I think it'll get wall
get<00:01:11.520> used<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> while<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:14.150> think<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
get used to it for a while I think it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
get used to it for a while I think it
opens<00:01:15.659> up<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.960> new<00:01:15.990> market<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.710> Microsoft<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
opens up a new market for Microsoft in

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.679 
opens up a new market for Microsoft in
just<00:01:17.610> tablets<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.180> usually<00:01:18.420> their

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
just tablets because usually their

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.200 
just tablets because usually their
windows<00:01:18.960> seven<00:01:19.290> tablets<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.799> suck<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.430> with

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
windows seven tablets just suck and with

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
windows seven tablets just suck and with
this<00:01:21.330> new<00:01:21.479> metro<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> Metro<00:01:22.530> UI<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.369> looks<00:01:23.580> so

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this new metro I Metro UI it looks so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
this new metro I Metro UI it looks so
much<00:01:24.540> better<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.830> found<00:01:26.250> myself

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
much better and then I found myself

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.039 
much better and then I found myself
basically<00:01:27.210> having<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.689> switch<00:01:27.869> between

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
basically having a switch between

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.929 
basically having a switch between
Windows<00:01:28.409> 7<00:01:28.770> desktop<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> Metro<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> want

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

it so you can probably integrate that a
little<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:31.920> better<00:01:32.159> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> feel<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.060> like

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
desktop and your Windows 8 you know

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
desktop and your Windows 8 you know
Metro<00:01:44.159> UI<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.850> nice<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.479> still

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
Metro UI that's nice because you still

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.910 
Metro UI that's nice because you still
have<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.960> full<00:01:46.079> functionality<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
have your full functionality that you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
have your full functionality that you
have<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.189> windows<00:01:47.460> 7<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.780> hand

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
have in windows 7 on the other hand

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.270 
have in windows 7 on the other hand
though<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:49.920> quite<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
though I don't think it's quite as a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
though I don't think it's quite as a
cohesive<00:01:50.729> experience<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.840> i

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
cohesive experience as it could be i

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.300 
cohesive experience as it could be i
think<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:52.799> jarring<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
think it's kind of a little jarring to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
think it's kind of a little jarring to
go<00:01:53.939> from<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.299> thinking<00:01:54.720> y'all<00:01:54.990> horizontally

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
go from you thinking y'all horizontally

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.530 
go from you thinking y'all horizontally
scrolling<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.700> kind<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> stuff<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> being

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
scrolling this kind of stuff to being

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
scrolling this kind of stuff to being
able<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.110> normal<00:01:58.259> desktop

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
able to go back to your normal desktop

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.670 
able to go back to your normal desktop

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the implementation of it yet i think

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
the implementation of it yet i think
that<00:02:03.630> Microsoft<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.229> definitely<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.680> well<00:02:05.189> I'm

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that Microsoft I definitely do well I'm

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.679 
that Microsoft I definitely do well I'm
sure<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:05.759> definitely<00:02:06.030> well<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> mean<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
sure they definitely well I mean you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.059

know<00:02:06.719> windows<00:02:07.049> 8<00:02:07.140> supply<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> year<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:07.950> show

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
know windows 8 supply a year will show

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.469 
know windows 8 supply a year will show
away<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.520> release<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.300> there's<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
away from release but I think there's a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.029 
away from release but I think there's a
lot<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:09.869> could<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.349> know<00:02:10.739> kind<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
lot that they could do to know kind of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.350 
lot that they could do to know kind of
make<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.790> better<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.270> an

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
make it a little bit better of an

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490 
make it a little bit better of an
experience

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
experience

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.840 
experience
now<00:02:13.590> beyond<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> there<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.400> also<00:02:14.550> some

of think about you know something like

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.960 
of think about you know something like
the<00:02:22.050> windows<00:02:22.860> app<00:02:23.010> store<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.850> other

about<00:02:25.470> Windows<00:02:25.770> 8<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> windows<00:02:27.300> App

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
about Windows 8 so with the windows App

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.940 
about Windows 8 so with the windows App
Store<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> be<00:02:28.440> honestly

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.740 
Store I think it's going to be honestly
better<00:02:29.250> than<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> mac<00:02:29.880> app<00:02:30.060> store<00:02:30.090> for<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
better than the mac app store for the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.090 
better than the mac app store for the
main<00:02:30.870> reason<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.800> lot<00:02:32.040> more

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
main reason is that there's a lot more

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.270 
main reason is that there's a lot more
users<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.330> pc<00:02:33.690> there's<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:34.620> more<00:02:34.890> apps

made for Windows and that's one of the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.350 
made for Windows and that's one of the
reasons<00:02:37.680> why<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.010> don't<00:02:38.280> use<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> mac<00:02:39.180> app

sure<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.239> be<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> lot<00:02:48.600> better<00:02:48.780> and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
sure it's going to be a lot better and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.410 
sure it's going to be a lot better and
pretty<00:02:50.220> much<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.580> mac<00:02:50.760> app<00:02:50.970> store<00:02:51.000> there

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
pretty much on the mac app store there

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.240 
pretty much on the mac app store there
aren't<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> much<00:02:52.080> applications<00:02:52.860> compared

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
aren't that much applications compared

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.620 
aren't that much applications compared
to<00:02:53.370> windows<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.850> it's<00:02:54.000> pretty<00:02:54.180> much<00:02:54.390> gonna<00:02:54.570> be

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
to windows so it's pretty much gonna be

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.360 
to windows so it's pretty much gonna be
like<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> opposite<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.620> mobile<00:02:55.920> phone

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
like the opposite on the mobile phone

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
like the opposite on the mobile phone
where<00:02:56.700> Apple<00:02:57.270> has<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> ton<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.690> applications

where Apple has a ton of applications
and<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:58.709> those<00:02:58.920> has<00:02:59.100> little<00:02:59.760> some<00:03:00.270> be<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and now those has little some be the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.020 
and now those has little some be the
total<00:03:00.840> opposite<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.560> plus<00:03:02.310> it'll<00:03:02.489> be<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.820> a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
