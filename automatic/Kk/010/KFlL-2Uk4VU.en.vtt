00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
well but is this season becoming the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.490 
well but is this season becoming the
most<00:02:31.590> testing<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.520> your<00:02:32.550> career<00:02:33.200> no<00:02:34.200> i<00:02:34.230> don't

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
most testing of your career no i don't

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.980 
most testing of your career no i don't
think<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.680> i<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.100> every<00:02:35.280> year<00:02:35.990> you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
think so i think that every year you

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.750 
think so i think that every year you
have<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.290> approach<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.800> decision<00:02:38.459> thinking

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
have to approach the decision thinking

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.380 
have to approach the decision thinking
about<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.780> win<00:02:39.930> something<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.910> every<00:02:41.910> year<00:02:42.120> is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
about to win something and every year is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.080 
about to win something and every year is
different<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.989> i<00:02:43.440> kinda<00:02:43.800> we<00:02:44.760> had<00:02:44.910> some

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
different so i kinda we had some

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.560 
different so i kinda we had some
problems<00:02:45.450> before<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:46.020> our<00:02:46.350> idea<00:02:47.280> now<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.570> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
problems before and our idea now is to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.479 
problems before and our idea now is to
improve<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.050> league<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.440> after<00:02:50.070> think

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
improve in the league and after think

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.100 
improve in the league and after think
about<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> fake<00:02:51.030> happen<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.630> Europa<00:02:52.080> League

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
about the fake happen the Europa League

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.710 
about the fake happen the Europa League
so<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.700> sometimes<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.910> teams<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so it's sometimes the teams they have a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.180 
so it's sometimes the teams they have a
bad<00:02:55.350> moment<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:56.090> has<00:02:57.090> been<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.450> same<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:58.709> all

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
bad moment but has been the same in all

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.890 
bad moment but has been the same in all
the<00:02:59.489> cases<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> clubs<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.690> have

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the cases in all the clubs so you have

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110 
the cases in all the clubs so you have
to<00:03:01.080> wait<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.440> everything<00:03:02.370> will<00:03:02.519> change<00:03:02.550> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to wait and everything will change and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970 
to wait and everything will change and
the<00:03:03.330> only<00:03:03.420> way<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.720> change<00:03:04.019> things<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.530> worked

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
the only way to change things it worked

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.230 
the only way to change things it worked
harder<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.580> try<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.360> do<00:03:06.570> things<00:03:06.720> their<00:03:06.959> well
