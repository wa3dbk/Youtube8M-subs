too<00:00:08.580> many<00:00:08.730> sports<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.300> them<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.570> go<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
too many sports for them to go in I

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.140 
too many sports for them to go in I
guess<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.889> could<00:00:11.070> go<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.309> sniper<00:00:11.639> squad<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
guess you could go in sniper squad the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.580 
guess you could go in sniper squad the
time<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.480> pullback<00:00:12.780> which<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.259> risky

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
time and pullback which is just so risky

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.980 
time and pullback which is just so risky
since<00:00:13.799> they<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:13.980> well<00:00:14.130> grouped<00:00:14.280> up<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> drugs

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
since they are well grouped up the drugs

l just look look I win this intense two
zealot<00:00:24.779> vs.<00:00:25.140> 11<00:00:25.410> drone<00:00:25.769> destroyed<00:00:26.189> race<00:00:26.430> have

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
zealot vs. 11 drone destroyed race have

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.160 
zealot vs. 11 drone destroyed race have
so<00:00:26.699> many<00:00:26.789> kills<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.300> them<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.570> 14<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.960> think

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
so many kills one of them is 14 I think

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
so many kills one of them is 14 I think
there's<00:00:28.349> no<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:29.160> actually<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.460> +1<00:00:29.910> shield<00:00:30.240> so

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
there's no it's actually a +1 shield so

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
there's no it's actually a +1 shield so
that<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.869> there's<00:00:30.990> no<00:00:31.199> reason<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that I think there's no reason that you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.830 
that I think there's no reason that you
tak<00:00:32.790> until<00:00:33.120> his<00:00:33.239> else<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.660> shields

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
tak until his else get all the shields

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600 
tak until his else get all the shields

he's<00:02:28.030> not<00:02:28.060> too<00:02:28.330> for<00:02:28.570> drones<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:29.050> this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
he's not too for drones I think this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.260 
he's not too for drones I think this
else<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.770> fight<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:29.950> killed<00:02:30.310> him<00:02:30.460> yeah<00:02:30.910> I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
else can just fight it killed him yeah I

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.470 
else can just fight it killed him yeah I
think<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.730> zealot<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.360> is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
think so this this one zealot this is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.090 
think so this this one zealot this is
the<00:02:34.570> most<00:02:34.720> important<00:02:35.140> cell<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.440> ever<00:02:35.650> built<00:02:35.920> I

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
the most important cell it ever built I

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.970 
the most important cell it ever built I
think<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.520> StarCraft<00:02:36.970> right<00:02:37.150> now<00:02:37.240> oh<00:02:37.680> oh

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
agree to a draw here yeah see let's game
on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.240> draw<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.720> don't<00:03:23.530> know<00:03:23.710> he<00:03:24.100> doesn't<00:03:24.220> want

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
on the draw I don't know he doesn't want

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.670 
on the draw I don't know he doesn't want
a<00:03:24.580> mine<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.780> mean<00:03:25.900> if<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.140> void<00:03:26.290> rachel

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
a mine and I mean if the void rachel

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.930 
a mine and I mean if the void rachel
goes<00:03:26.920> over<00:03:27.130> there<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.280> there<00:03:27.460> is<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.580> Phoenix

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
goes over there and there is a Phoenix

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.130 
goes over there and there is a Phoenix
also<00:03:28.120> scouting<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.720> don't<00:03:28.900> think<00:03:29.050> that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
also scouting so I don't think that

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.110 
also scouting so I don't think that
drone<00:03:29.350> will<00:03:29.500> mind<00:03:30.010> for<00:03:30.220> too<00:03:30.340> long<00:03:30.490> I<00:03:30.670> guess<00:03:30.970> he

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
drone will mind for too long I guess he

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.430 
drone will mind for too long I guess he
just<00:03:31.150> doesn't<00:03:31.390> want<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.690> mine<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.200> five<00:03:32.410> hours

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
just doesn't want a mine for five hours

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.110 
just doesn't want a mine for five hours
I<00:03:33.010> guess<00:03:33.250> no<00:03:33.430> he<00:03:33.580> could<00:03:33.730> have<00:03:33.820> brought<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
I guess no he could have brought the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.490 
I guess no he could have brought the
sports<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.570> left<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.050> he's<00:03:35.170> gonna<00:03:35.290> be<00:03:35.380> a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
sports to the left so he's gonna be a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.630 
sports to the left so he's gonna be a
draw<00:03:35.710> guys<00:03:37.080> after<00:03:38.080> i<00:03:38.140> agreeing<00:03:38.440> with<00:03:39.370> one

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
draw guys after i agreeing with one

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.100 
draw guys after i agreeing with one
voice<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.270> he<00:03:40.480> could<00:03:40.630> have<00:03:40.720> covered<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
voice I think he could have covered the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.240 
voice I think he could have covered the
myth<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.410> guess<00:03:41.560> he<00:03:41.680> doesn't<00:03:41.830> want<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.130> stay

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
myth I guess he doesn't want to stay

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.980 
myth I guess he doesn't want to stay
here<00:03:42.370> for<00:03:42.550> five<00:03:42.700> hours<00:03:42.730> if<00:03:43.420> he<00:03:43.570> moved<00:03:43.840> to

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
here for five hours if he moved to

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.990 
here for five hours if he moved to
sports<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.710> guess<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.070> left<00:03:45.430> then<00:03:45.730> he<00:03:45.850> could

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
sports I guess to the left then he could

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.550 
sports I guess to the left then he could
have<00:03:46.120> mind<00:03:46.330> maybe<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.780> one<00:03:47.080> drone<00:03:47.260> on<00:03:47.410> that

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
have mind maybe the one drone on that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.080 
have mind maybe the one drone on that
very<00:03:47.770> base<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.130> don't<00:03:48.280> think<00:03:48.490> one<00:03:48.670> void<00:03:48.910> ray

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
very base I don't think one void ray

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.420 
very base I don't think one void ray
kills<00:03:49.390> five<00:03:49.900> spores<00:03:50.290> exactly<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.250> think

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
kills five spores exactly so I think

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.750 
kills five spores exactly so I think
life<00:03:51.670> who<00:03:51.880> could<00:03:52.090> have<00:03:52.240> one<00:03:52.450> still
