00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.960
 Mulino Bianco 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.719
 it was the summer of 1990 I was 12 years old 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 I remember I wanted it, I wanted it at all 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.170
 the costs took about 25 points 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.320
 of the white mill snacks for 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.359
 can have it and my mom the snacks 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.240
 numbers never bought I wanted it from 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.890
 die so much that I remember we were in 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.790
 vacation and even while I slept I said 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 there was a morning I woke up 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.590
 my brother told me look at that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.260
 last night he shouted finally arrives at 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.690
 it cooks mine and I wasn't even made 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.250
 account of course there is a clock that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 water works to who it is that doesn't 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.649
 wants to 12 years so gift with points 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.829
 of the snacks I had the card collected 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.480
 I also had two or three points because 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.969
 something I had managed to buy 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.970
 in the mother, however, from there to 25 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.340
 points and even talk about it 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.630
 and practically nothing and I stayed in 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.330
 this in this state of desire 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.040
 as never before then the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.050
 typical competition in late September 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.290
 that year cerny worlds indeed as 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.510
 see here is the mascot of Italy 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.450
 90 I don't follow football I don't understand 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.660
 absolutely football remember who 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.650
 he played the ticket and had the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:37.170
 possibility to choose between two 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.070
 names to give to the mascot of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.140
 of Italy we say that in the end it is 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.170
 was chosen bye as name other not 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.970
 I remember which one perhaps because I repeat not 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.979
 you know that kick and nothing I've put away 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.650
 the idea of ​​being able to own it 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.250
 you know things just do not say oh well 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.990
 I can have it then I ca n't say too 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.300
 well as it was you know that there is the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.130
 law of attraction so I desired 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.600
 so much that something did in 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.390
 so that it came to me one morning 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.510
 in the summer of 1994 then four years 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.130
 later and I was getting on the bus 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.110
 morning like 7 mar 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.019
 just had breakfast in front of me 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.519
 europe europe climbs ahead of me yes 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.360
 he bent over to pick something up 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.750
 was about to tell him but what he does and what he is 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.459
 collecting from the ground and he turned around 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 and he told me tom and put me in his hand 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.430
 that this watch here in me came 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.330
 a blow for me was like I don't know if 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.120
 you know how in the movies when 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.160
 when everything disappears and there is this choir 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 and the background light does not light up 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.970
 hear this chorus so I said cabbage 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.370
 I say it's not possible I don't believe it 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470
 I recognized him immediately, I said this 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.130
 and the water watch I got I immediately 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.190
 put in your pocket 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.650
 for fear that someone said to you 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.270
 mine is mine instead I actually discovered 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.150
 after that it was there all night then 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.720
 no one would have called him back anyway 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.130
 apologized sorry and nothing I did 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.770
 run almost all of the bus thinking 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.330
 cabbage I have the voice in my pocket but I don't say 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.450
 it's not possible maybe it looks like him 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.220
 it is not he is a clock that resembles the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.290
 cosma is not the proof on the shot out of 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.350
 there is still a hidden glance in the car 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.670
 wrote his own water watcher to him 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.220
 there was still a little something to be seen 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.340
 still something on the display like that 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.440
 it works after I even understand why 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.240
 what do you want me to tell you in advertising 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.870
 on television it's not like they used to say how 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.980
 just basically it's a watch 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.690
 that the battery 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.390
 like all the others, the battery though 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.450
 you can't see behind it 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.950
 sponge with two electrodes connected yes 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.560
 also sees something in semi-transparent 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:03.310
 moistening it with the sponge yes with 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.550
 water conducts electric current e 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.620
 then display lights up and shows 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.120
 then there was only time and date 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.310
 seconds and three basic samples after a tot 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.790
 of time a little because the sponge 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.560
 evaporate 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.350
 the run is not over water 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.680
 leads practically happens that i 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.030
 waste chick faded a little 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.400
 it was enough to go to any fountain 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.050
 under the tap just a moment and in 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.130
 a flash the display brightens up e 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.560
 I remember I used it for when I got it 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.120
 found in 94 still worked and I have it 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.980
 used for a year because I went to 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.210
 school with this watch here are 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.260
 sure and then just don't go there anymore 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.730
 it remained weight to be one of the few 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.410
 to have him to have it again is the only ad 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.260
 have desired and never had and after 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.210
 four years when on those things that 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.570
 one says the last thing you expected not 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.390
 it was something I put away 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.250
 I never imagined such a thing 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.870
 yet I came out to have the law 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.670
 Here is the attraction 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.520
 I mean, in short, we want one 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.240
 what in one way or another succeeds 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.130
 to get it had also done 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.230
 fool in 90 I remember that I was 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.360
 also went to some store 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.520
 watches to ask how it was possible 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.110
 that a watch runs on water not 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.660
 because I was needed side and all 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.970
 manners of heaven from there will be inside a 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.950
 reservoirs or a chemical reaction of 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.200
 some kind of a whirlpool that it generates 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.300
 electric current 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.690
 I thought all of them and then at the end 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:47.210
 let's say, though, a freckled frog 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.250
 summer 1990 threw away that it is not 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.990
 a lot the points collection card if 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:58.400
 had I known I would have had it 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.540
 still it is a gift of water snacks 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.590
 voice 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.590
 the clock is, however, water
