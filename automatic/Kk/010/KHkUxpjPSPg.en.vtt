00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.080
 mamma mia hi friends and welcome 

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:06.130
 in this open death video then in 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.870
 this video what are we going 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.250
 do we will start something 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.540
 interesting enough 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.760
 we will build here everything 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.139
 just a little jacques you go us 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.090
 to be able to simulate a 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.150
 conversation with their sores 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.590
 ok we consume on the back is here explained 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.540
 a little the principle of intelligence 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.930
 artificial that consists of everything 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.970
 simply to give here this minimum of 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.200
 consciousness in our family computer 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.510
 because as you know 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.650
 the computer is an excuse equipment 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.449
 me of the term to these beasts 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.100
 the fact that doing what was asked of him 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.020
 so he can not think like a 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 To be human 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.440
 and with the readers years artificial 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 will try to make sure that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.650
 the computer can simply 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.650
 have some behaviors here 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.580
 similar to those of the human being 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.680
 so what are we going to do 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.780
 now nothing very complicated I 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 you concocted what you fuss about me 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.470
 I tried to improve on the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.510
 previous version that we had so 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.309
 when he clicks here chat with mister 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.220
 robot at whom do you see good on the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.660
 subject here is getting bigger I click again 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.420
 and retreat 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.400
 also my element and extent is my 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 item retracts one has the possibility 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.060
 to close the cult chapter so knew 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.090
 I do not know red at kebab moncade 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 disappears 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.040

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.480
 just here being said I have the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.760
 possibility also to do it but 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.790
 I click on the files by osiatis 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.620
 also disappears so there now 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.170

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.530
 famous robot but here it's him what is

 and there he answered us I go down the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.349
 square root of 25 easy tests lol 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.569
 so there I say simply I have to 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.209

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.020
 who is hiding behind this stream 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.480
 so I quickly close here our 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.520
 famous cat and we will already start with 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.780
 adopt a better structure by 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.530
 simply report to our 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.080
 different files 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.270
 so what did I do to this 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.190
 level at the index level e.html case 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.950
 present this level I create a file 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.570
 steal princess in a css folder so 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.360
 if I come to this level of taste of 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.940
 recent monaco in a folder csg crds 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.590
 and a steal officer princess the level 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.450
 of this skillpoints css file what is this 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.700
 that I did I simply here 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.740
 sank in the famous daring and s is this 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.840
 that we put previously high 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.390
 level here of a size tag and I 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.060
 connected now is 2006 bichi there 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.130
 likewise I have here also create a 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.020
 js script file in a folder 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.590
 we already had previously 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.740
 contained the bookstore 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.930
 so I write in this script file - js 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.570
 I also put the code we had 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.820
 put here years roughly paid to 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.920
 level there ok so I wanted to me 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.990
 also here which allows to have a 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.630
 cost that is much better structured 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.400
 so we stop we have our html which is not 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.590
 not mixed with the side is this 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.850
 had javascript code and we could 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.430
 start on a good foundation 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.070
 ok then guys also structure 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.890

 to have here this little icon that 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.260
 lets close here our famous 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.620
 chat window 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.480
