00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.990 
with the options I wanted to have at
reasonable<00:06:20.420> price<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:21.490> also<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.670> found

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
reasonable price and also I found

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.290 
reasonable price and also I found
somebody<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.720> was<00:06:23.900> giving<00:06:24.290> me<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:25.300> good

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
somebody that was giving me a good

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.580 
somebody that was giving me a good
amount<00:06:26.900> of<00:06:27.110> money<00:06:27.380> to

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
amount of money to

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.200 
amount of money to
to<00:06:28.980> take<00:06:29.220> back<00:06:29.430> this<00:06:29.640> car<00:06:29.940> actually

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.059 

so<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.389> think<00:06:36.930> I've<00:06:37.080> made<00:06:37.259> a<00:06:37.319> good<00:06:37.530> deal<00:06:37.740> of

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
so I think I've made a good deal of

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.700 
so I think I've made a good deal of
course<00:06:38.699> I'm<00:06:38.879> gonna<00:06:39.000> do<00:06:39.300> videos<00:06:40.289> about<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.680> new

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
course I'm gonna do videos about the new

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.800 
course I'm gonna do videos about the new
car<00:06:41.069> when<00:06:41.310> I<00:06:41.569> collect<00:06:42.569> it<00:06:42.780> and<00:06:43.849> I<00:06:44.849> will<00:06:45.569> for

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
car when I collect it and I will for

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.969 
car when I collect it and I will for
sure<00:06:45.840> compare<00:06:46.849> that<00:06:47.870> next<00:06:48.870> car<00:06:49.169> with<00:06:49.409> this<00:06:49.650> one

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
sure compare that next car with this one

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.570 
sure compare that next car with this one
because<00:06:50.849> there<00:06:51.180> are<00:06:51.300> a<00:06:51.330> lot<00:06:51.539> of<00:06:51.780> similarities

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
because there are a lot of similarities

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.300 
because there are a lot of similarities
between<00:06:53.580> those<00:06:53.909> two<00:06:54.120> cars<00:06:55.129> but<00:06:56.129> with<00:06:56.280> a

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
between those two cars but with a

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.920 
between those two cars but with a
different<00:06:56.729> philosophy

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.870 

so<00:07:02.500> that's<00:07:02.710> it<00:07:03.060> just<00:07:04.230> wanted<00:07:05.230> to<00:07:05.380> share<00:07:05.880> this

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
so that's it just wanted to share this

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.150 
so that's it just wanted to share this
information<00:07:07.210> with<00:07:07.600> you<00:07:07.930> I'm<00:07:08.680> gonna<00:07:08.860> try<00:07:09.130> to

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
information with you I'm gonna try to

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.060 
information with you I'm gonna try to
shoot<00:07:09.490> some<00:07:09.700> more<00:07:09.730> videos<00:07:10.450> about<00:07:10.780> the<00:07:11.200> a45

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
shoot some more videos about the a45

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.399 
shoot some more videos about the a45
before<00:07:12.820> I<00:07:13.120> give<00:07:13.750> it<00:07:13.780> back

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:17.409 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.029 

but<00:07:17.709> the<00:07:18.039> truth<00:07:18.339> is<00:07:18.610> that<00:07:18.939> I<00:07:19.419> only<00:07:20.169> have<00:07:20.589> one

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
but the truth is that I only have one

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.169 
but the truth is that I only have one
week<00:07:21.429> left<00:07:21.569> and<00:07:22.860> considering<00:07:23.860> that<00:07:24.179> during

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:25.179 
week left and considering that during

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:26.699 
week left and considering that during
the<00:07:25.330> week<00:07:25.479> is<00:07:25.629> difficult<00:07:26.139> for<00:07:26.289> me<00:07:26.409> to<00:07:26.529> shoot

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:26.709 
the week is difficult for me to shoot

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:31.620 
the week is difficult for me to shoot
videos<00:07:28.019> because<00:07:29.019> I'm<00:07:29.169> working

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.210 

so<00:07:32.630> there<00:07:32.810> are<00:07:32.900> just<00:07:33.110> a<00:07:33.260> few<00:07:33.440> days<00:07:33.620> remaining

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
so there are just a few days remaining

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.680 
so there are just a few days remaining
to<00:07:34.670> shoot<00:07:35.450> some<00:07:35.630> more<00:07:35.660> videos

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
to shoot some more videos

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.680 
to shoot some more videos
so<00:07:38.290> there<00:07:38.470> you<00:07:38.500> go<00:07:38.590> probably<00:07:39.070> on<00:07:39.370> a<00:07:40.000> couple<00:07:40.600> of

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:40.690 
so there you go probably on a couple of

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.130 
so there you go probably on a couple of
videos<00:07:41.170> a<00:07:41.560> couple<00:07:42.010> of<00:07:42.340> weeks<00:07:42.520> you<00:07:42.910> will<00:07:43.060> I<00:07:43.450> will

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.140
