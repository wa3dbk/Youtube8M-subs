00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.830
 or the collision beasts here we are 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.650
 with the third and final video of the biceps 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.530
 triceps super series is worth remembering that 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.750
 We do three exercises of four series 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.570
 and between eight and ten repetitions worth 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.630
 let's do some chin- ups for biceps 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.179
 ok the pull-up bar with the arms 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 open we are going to do 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.649
 as it is the last exercise and you will come 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.539
 quite tired of the other two because 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.390
 let's work to the fault ok when 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.559
 we see that the body is blocked 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.690
 that stays there we go down and 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.269
 we calmly stop jose we are going to 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 do a demonstration of how to work 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:43.570
 the dominated at times that's how you see 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.829
 we stretch all the biceps there and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.940
 We climbed up a little beyond 90 ° 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.440
 we stretch a little more that looks good 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.510
 José 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.530
 comes down 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.780
 the vice ok we arrived with the bar 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.050
 chin up 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.519
 Now you can go far and be able to go down 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.490
 next exercise that we will explain 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.500
 we have a little time and guys from 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.830
 super series of dominated biceps we are going to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.710
 move to the parallels for triceps in your 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.140
 fish tank is an exercise that punishes a lot 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.570
 the arms are going down with the elbows 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.399
 stick as much as possible a little 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.360
 beyond 90 degrees the body 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.420
 we try to make it as straight as possible 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.000
 that's how you can see there we do not tilt 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.619
 a lot because if we would not work 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.800
 pectoral and we are interested in working on 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.710

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.770
