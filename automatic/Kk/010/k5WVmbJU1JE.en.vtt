00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 the television more environment quite 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.020
 rugged for those who are married and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.300
 for those who do not because when dad and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.160
 mom decide to divorce the children 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.259
 then as daisy said a few ago 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.540
 moments enter with an uncertainty a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.100
 fear and how good it is already with 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.289
 us here in the room so that we 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.810
 explain how potatoes we could do 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 or how that how to prepare the children or 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 what solution to give him margarita welcome 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 How nice is that being here another 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 same time today 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.040
 guys, it gives me great pleasure 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.780
 difficult one does not always look good on the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 divorce question nothing does not look 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 no divorce for better that has been 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.809
 handled goes from pechito with children and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 well even though they could suddenly 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.960
 children are seeing that the dads are already 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 are getting along and that may end 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 that's as bad as giving them the news as 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.219
 first give them how to tell them yes yes so 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.309
 as you suspected it greater sum 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.870
 where we stop if then we have to leave 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.989
 from the base 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.930
 that will somehow always be 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.830
 affected and now what you do have to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.500
 to think is of the evils the least has 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.250
 to be disastrous chaotic terrible 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.380
 very painful and pretty good 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.040
 they beat us pretty well what 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.590
 integrated reasonably easy and 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.399
 we keep driving well but it's the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.220
 difference between being chaotic or being the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.789
 reason but it is true that the children of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.479
 divorced parents never never 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:42.990
 they surpass or can be 6 years old 4 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.539
 10 14 or 25 and always say I think that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 It will be important that when the boy goes 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.670
 growing and start taking over 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.950
 his life that is something that the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.649
 to work it and clean it when I have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.840
 I no longer know 16 when I already have that 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.909
 moment they are more children of course 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.960
 then go walking so that he 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.060
 can or can she be then 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.630
 one very important thing is that the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.819
 news of divorce has been common 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.590
 agreement the two to see shorties we go 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.350
 to go and question it, we're going here in the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.530
 house sit in the room dad and mom ' 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.090
 together we have something to tell you is not 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.310
 I tell you by my side do not tell you for your 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.030
 side or in the middle of a lawsuit or a 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.410
 situation like that but it 's a situation 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.350
 joint that that is very important 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.660
 continue to drive dad and mom 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.940
 education style always in a manner 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.920
 joint although they are divorced although 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.489
 are living in two cases already separated 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.410
 it's dad and I have thought that we do not 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.459
 like the idea that you go to that 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.400
 vacation with that child because my mom and 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.019
 I agree that the school 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.480
 which you are going to go next year is 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.310
 another because it deals with so much but that is 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.380
 something altogether now also the ning 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.840
 dads have to handle the reaction 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.810
 of the children that almost does not select but 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.810
 give the child a chance to be angry 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.780
 that kicks you from breaking insult 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.670
 and he gets down on the bed and does not want 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.670
 talk to either of them for several 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.610
 days you have to truly understand them 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.489
 the child is growing on a 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.980
 platform which is good stability 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.110
 malaga lawsuits or not that daddy gives him and 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.770
 mom is like removing the carpet 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.600
 while standing on the carpet that you 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.209
 moves on the mat is a tremor of 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.819
 then it is very important that 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.660
 the dads once they take the agreement 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.900
 I would recommend that they go to a therapy 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.030
 to a session on how we're going to handle it 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.830
 with children and something that is very 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.430
 important and that is rarely said 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.120
 it is also the fundamental thing that is between 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.010
 dad and mom clean the laces 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.140
 energetics that have been joining them 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.239
 that is us we think like that 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.830
 we have a good physical body already 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.500
 we accept that in addition to the physical body 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.810
 we have our emotional work but 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.850
 our our emotional area but 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.720
 apart from the physical body and the body 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.380
 emotional we have subtle bodies 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.769
 around our body which is the 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.430
 energetic body and are stuck 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.310
 with others and they are attached to another person 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.440
 and then you to be connected or be 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.200
 the energy bodies that are most 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.770
 strongly connected are mom with the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.840
 children 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.250
 with the children fundamentally mom does not 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.500
 you had in the belly what have you been 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.810
 nourishing your body and so on and 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.110
 there is also a deep connection 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.990
 energetic after intimacy 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.470
 sexual, that's why it's very important 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.910
 this super liberal question of this 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.260
 good night good that parents the 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.410
 We spent last night like you told me you 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.510
 he called or is from couples has been 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.080
 innocent you are creating links 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.970
 energetic with that person who in turn 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.220
 brings the energy links connected 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.510
 with all the people with whom 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.280
 attend or nothing else will fish 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.990
 diseases but in the case of 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.090
 cannes case of the communes after 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.129
 many years then imagine the links 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.619
 energetic 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:21.699
 then you have to clean that cord that 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:24.129
 more or less it's like a quarter ones 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.409
 four centimeters below the navel 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.589
 from there there is that connection of that 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.569
 link as energy cord then 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:35.499
 you are going to be able to be present or 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.959
 can not ok imagine the person and you go 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:41.110
 to begin to visualize what enters as 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:43.419
 a golden white light for you comes out there and 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.599
 will clean that cord that opens to the 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:49.179
 half and falls towards a violet flame 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.849
 imaginary you will visualize it in the center 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:55.300
 and you are going to imagine this white light 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.839
 golden that goes through the other person leaves 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.809
 and everything that has grudges comes out 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:05.050
 angry disloyal resentments or 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:07.839
 fendi all everything all that goes to 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.479
 leave the two towards the violet flame 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.999
 that transmutes to the earth until 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.380
 you feel that the coral is already 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:16.330
 cleansed 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.510
 you can imagine it as a golden light 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.610
 that runs and dissolves that is the 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.370
 energy divorce divorce energy 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.780
 You can not do good with children 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.030
 how difficult it there is that almost everyone 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.540
 ends bad when divorced very 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.980
 important since it 's there you do not need the 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.200
 be present 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.570
 ok ok but i would say the other person do 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.940
 loose or that the other person does it and 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.580
 the other what you say is all that 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.970
 have against me what you have of anger 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.530
 of resentment at this time is 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.750
 dissolve do not get into free will 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.030
 of the other but you're simply 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.880
 cleaning this connection and from there 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.520
 then you will be able to handle much better 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.040
 all the emotional parts and 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.540
 logistics that will have to be handled 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.150
 I go to your house to do the homework
