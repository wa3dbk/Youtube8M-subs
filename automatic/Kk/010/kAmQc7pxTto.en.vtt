the only problem I'm having as I've been
with<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.550> independent<00:02:32.550> eyes<00:02:32.640> stuff<00:02:33.060> for

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
with this independent eyes stuff for

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.600 
with this independent eyes stuff for
going<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.840> long<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:35.220> brain<00:02:35.550> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
going for so long that my brain is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.940 
going for so long that my brain is
having<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.240> reformat<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.230> fact<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.740> hey<00:02:37.890> you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
having to reformat the fact that hey you

having to reformat the fact that hey you
can<00:02:38.130> both<00:02:38.610> eyes<00:02:38.850> are<00:02:39.060> looking<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> same

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
can both eyes are looking at the same

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.700 
can both eyes are looking at the same
object<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:42.030> what<00:02:42.840> I'm<00:02:42.960> doing<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.440> I'm

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
object and so now what I'm doing is I'm

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.430 
object and so now what I'm doing is I'm
able<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.880> same<00:02:45.090> object<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.840> keep

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
able to see the same object and keep

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.800 
able to see the same object and keep
both<00:02:46.710> eyes<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.190> unison<00:02:47.670> which<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.750> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
both eyes in unison which is going to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.250 
both eyes in unison which is going to
give<00:02:49.020> me

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
give me

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.200 
give me
I<00:02:49.290> believe<00:02:49.800> my<00:02:49.950> depth<00:02:50.250> perception<00:02:50.340> back<00:02:50.970> which

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
I believe my depth perception back which

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.260 
I believe my depth perception back which
I<00:02:51.360> think<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.780> have<00:02:51.960> gotten<00:02:52.320> some<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.830> back

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
I think I have gotten some of that back

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.070 
I think I have gotten some of that back
so<00:02:54.270> um<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.530> again<00:02:55.830> I'm<00:02:56.480> sometimes<00:02:57.480> I'm<00:02:57.810> having

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
so um so again I'm sometimes I'm having

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960 
so um so again I'm sometimes I'm having
to<00:02:58.140> consciously<00:02:58.650> think<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.250> sometimes<00:02:59.490> not

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
to consciously think of it sometimes not

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.370 
to consciously think of it sometimes not
but<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.440> probably<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.830> was<00:03:02.040> reading<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:03.300> want<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
but the probably I was reading I want to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.550 
but the probably I was reading I want to
go<00:03:04.530> more<00:03:04.800> into<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.480> monocular<00:03:06.480> vision<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.350> one

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
go more into a monocular vision with one

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.490 
go more into a monocular vision with one
eye<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.120> larger<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> print<00:03:09.930> more<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.320> can

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
eye but the larger the print more I can

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.130 
eye but the larger the print more I can
do<00:03:10.620> double<00:03:11.010> vision<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.490> mean<00:03:11.790> see<00:03:12.140> binocular

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
do double vision I mean see binocular

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.980 
do double vision I mean see binocular
what<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.890> do<00:03:14.010> too<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.460> I<00:03:14.580> use<00:03:15.060> my<00:03:15.240> finger<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.720> read

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
what I do too is I use my finger to read

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.900 
what I do too is I use my finger to read
so<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.290> keep<00:03:16.500> my<00:03:16.680> both<00:03:16.860> eyes<00:03:17.070> together<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.820> I'm

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
so I keep my both eyes together so I'm

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.030 
so I keep my both eyes together so I'm
retraining<00:03:18.570> my<00:03:18.600> brain<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.860> my<00:03:19.890> eyes

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
retraining my brain for that but my eyes

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.770 
retraining my brain for that but my eyes
are<00:03:20.070> straight<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:20.580> mean<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:20.910> go<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.360> left<00:03:21.570> I

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
are straight I mean I go to the left I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
are straight I mean I go to the left I
go<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.140> right<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.620> mean<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.370> know<00:03:23.489> they<00:03:23.700> are

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
go to the right I mean you know they are

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.590 
go to the right I mean you know they are
dead-on<00:03:24.800> straight<00:03:25.800> um

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
dead-on straight um

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.890 
dead-on straight um
so<00:03:28.140> I'm<00:03:28.680> hoping<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.430> helps<00:03:30.060> those<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.540> are

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
so I'm hoping this helps those that are

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.640 
so I'm hoping this helps those that are
thinking<00:03:30.930> about<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:33.080> again<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.380> hear<00:03:34.530> it
