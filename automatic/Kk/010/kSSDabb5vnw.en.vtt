00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.790
 well today I'm going out for two 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.619
 recipes while I have the oven busy 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.230
 on disk zebra I will take advantage of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.930
 warm up and make some snacks 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 chocolate or me chocolate neapolitans 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.609
 in this case as not yet to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.309
 then a piece of nougat 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 chocolate'll use it and it has 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.269
 expense but you can do it with the card 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 of normal tomato and current already 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.480
 with the recipe and the amount of chocolate 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.699
 decathlete to be used and you're 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.799
 a sheet of pastry and a little 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.530
 more and defined chocolate sugar by 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.180
 over to repatriate good I done 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.970
 when I had it in the fridge so during 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.340
 with a little hard because he has already focused 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.570
 a little 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.570
 the church make chunks 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.600
 as if they were half an ounce of 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.680
 chocolate not for our eyes too 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.540
 great because they are going to be miniature 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.790
 so they talk about a few squares 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.340
 we have already thrown the mass law is more 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.450
 big and cut in four parts 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.420
 same 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.850
 following the longer side so that it 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.360
 make them more quantity of me the little balls 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.580
 I'm going to make them pretty mini so 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 let's go putting pieces of 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.640
 chocolate 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.720
 I'll teach it between one and the rest 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.720
 same 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 I think that's how good agreements 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 from small 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.700
 it's very simple we're just going to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.700
 close 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.710
 I'm going to turn around so it's 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.140
 a little more complicated that the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.140
 points down and gets better ground 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.790
 you can use the chocolate you most 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.520
 like with hazelnuts almonds with milk 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.420
 in stink or as you want and now with the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.420
 we are going to mark 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900
 the midpoints 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.520
 and with the knife we ​​just cut 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.520
 in half 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.910
 we make sure that they are well 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.390
 closed by the sides 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.760
 and we put them in the oven tray 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.799
 with a separation because they are going to grow 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.629
 we have made all our mines 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.790
 little balls have seen that a 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.590
 bunch and now just what are we going 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.700
 to do is going to be painting them with 'google 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.409
 well beaten to give them shine and color and 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.030
 we are going to put in the oven 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.940
 reality until they are made depends 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.200
 of the size of the advice or you have 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.209
 Stretched puff pastry 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.220
 until you see that in the color and 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.670
 like I think it's going to take 15 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.760
 Minutitos at 200 degrees a day puts 200 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.700
 so that puff pastry is inflated and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.980
 be well chubby be careful of 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.440
 seal the edges well with your finger 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.140
 tighten it well so that the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.480
 nougat chocolate is in this 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.550
 case it's not going to melt a lot but if 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.580
 you do it with chocolate pill 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.650
 will be completely liquid inside and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.150
 delicious the truth is that it is great and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.600
 open as your children are going to 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.840
 love and the older ones more good I'm going to 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.980
 finish painting this an egg and ya 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.959
 go after baking the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.030
 as it did the oven have been more or 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.760
 less about ten minutes and they have been done 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.530
 pretty stable 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.260
 I'll sprinkle with a little 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.390
 icing sugar on top 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.730
 I know which answer to be cold while 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.950
 others worry they are hot 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.560
 Well, this is the recipe that I have 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.230
 taught that it is very simple and you are left 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.090
 a sim and spectacular napolitanas 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.750
 I 'm sure you 'll love it 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.750
 until next time
