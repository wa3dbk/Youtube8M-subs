really oh wait wait whoa I didn't want
to<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> way<00:01:05.129> actually

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
to go this way actually

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.929 
to go this way actually
let's<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.189> backwards<00:01:08.930> for<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> moment<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.939> yes

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
let's go backwards for a moment here yes

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
let's go backwards for a moment here yes
there's<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.600> alternate<00:01:13.049> route<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
there's an alternate route down here of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
there's an alternate route down here of
all<00:01:14.460> places<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.720> believe<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> can

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
all places and I believe you can

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
all places and I believe you can
actually<00:01:16.590> head<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.080> way

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
actually head back up if you go this way

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.160 
actually head back up if you go this way
work

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.630 

that's<00:01:25.170> another<00:01:25.890> glitch

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that's another glitch

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
that's another glitch
oh<00:01:26.670> yeah<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:27.290> did<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> could<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.040> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
oh yeah I did not know you could do that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.359 
oh yeah I did not know you could do that
I<00:01:29.400> knew<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.150> could<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:31.010> scale<00:01:32.010> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I knew that you could just scale the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.380 
I knew that you could just scale the
wall<00:01:32.610> by<00:01:33.119> jumping<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.500> by<00:01:34.830> running<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.700> quicken

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
wall by jumping or by running up quicken

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.800 
wall by jumping or by running up quicken
up<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.049> high<00:01:37.740> enough<00:01:37.979> speed<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.180> didn't<00:01:39.509> know

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
up a high enough speed but I didn't know

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
up a high enough speed but I didn't know
you<00:01:39.869> could<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.610> clip<00:01:41.610> through<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.210> wall

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you could just clip through the wall

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.950 
you could just clip through the wall
like<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.670> that's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.820> new<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.390> okay<00:01:47.960> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
like that that's a new one on me okay so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530 
like that that's a new one on me okay so
yeah<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.700> pretty<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.940> think<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
yeah but pretty much I think all the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.850 
yeah but pretty much I think all the
different<00:01:51.930> routes<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.530> possibly

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
different routes that you can possibly

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.600 
different routes that you can possibly
take<00:01:53.190> in<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> zone<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.560> act<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.490> now

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
take in that zone or that act it's now

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
take in that zone or that act it's now
emerald<00:01:57.119> forest<00:01:59.720> okay<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.259> area<00:02:03.080> what<00:02:04.080> is
