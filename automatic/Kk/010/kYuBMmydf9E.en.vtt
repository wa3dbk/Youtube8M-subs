sides start increasing the size and you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.100 
sides start increasing the size and you
see<00:02:31.000> slowly<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:32.560> metal<00:02:33.310> effect<00:02:34.150> coming<00:02:34.959> if

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
see slowly your metal effect coming if

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.460 
see slowly your metal effect coming if
you<00:02:35.860> go<00:02:36.069> all<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.340> way<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.569> lose<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.260> lose

was saying I increase the range and it's

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.879 
was saying I increase the range and it's
metal<00:03:42.669> like<00:03:42.819> it's<00:03:43.120> very<00:03:43.569> nice<00:03:43.900> let's<00:03:44.680> see

before and after and here the controller

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.610 
before and after and here the controller
can<00:03:48.190> change<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.180> get<00:03:49.480> another<00:03:49.900> fact<00:03:50.230> if<00:03:50.440> you
