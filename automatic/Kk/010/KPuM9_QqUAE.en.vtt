chip sir when I actually crash this this

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.500 
chip sir when I actually crash this this
whole<00:03:11.040> thing's<00:03:11.340> working<00:03:11.549> cracked<00:03:12.030> into<00:03:12.329> like

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
and this linkage is actually from the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.069 
and this linkage is actually from the
Gixxer<00:03:17.430> too<00:03:17.640> because<00:03:17.910> mine<00:03:18.120> was<00:03:18.329> all<00:03:18.480> bent<00:03:18.870> up

bike<00:03:37.019> like<00:03:37.320> me<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:37.829> sv650

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
bike like me on this sv650

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.050 
bike like me on this sv650
and<00:03:39.200> then<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> tail<00:03:41.010> section<00:03:41.340> here<00:03:41.850> what

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
and then on the tail section here what

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.699 
and then on the tail section here what
I've<00:03:42.180> done<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.840> basically<00:03:42.989> took<00:03:43.500> out

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
I've done is I just basically took out

I've done is I just basically took out
the<00:03:44.239> grab<00:03:45.239> bar<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.690> think<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.079> looks<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.319> lot

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
the grab bar I think it looks a lot

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.680 
the grab bar I think it looks a lot
cleaner<00:03:46.680> without<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.579> there<00:03:47.819> but<00:03:48.390> again<00:03:48.450> I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
cleaner without it on there but again I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.240 
cleaner without it on there but again I
have<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:48.989> little<00:03:49.170> gap<00:03:49.560> right<00:03:49.590> here<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
have this little gap right here it

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.830 
have this little gap right here it
doesn't<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.640> bother<00:03:50.880> me<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.420> much<00:03:51.600> but

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
doesn't really bother me that much but

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.900 
doesn't really bother me that much but
it<00:03:51.959> might<00:03:52.079> bother<00:03:52.230> some<00:03:52.530> other<00:03:52.560> people<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.850> I

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it might bother some other people and I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.550 
it might bother some other people and I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
got this sweet speed dent right here

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.410 
got this sweet speed dent right here
