wanted to showcase in the sunshine as

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.779 
wanted to showcase in the sunshine as
you<00:01:44.810> can<00:01:44.990> see<00:01:45.229> indirect<00:01:45.770> lighting<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.460> very

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
you can see indirect lighting it is very

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.740 
you can see indirect lighting it is very
much<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.330> light<00:01:47.899> golden<00:01:48.500> brown<00:01:48.860> overall<00:01:49.750> does

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
much a light golden brown overall does

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.410 
much a light golden brown overall does
have<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.500> longer<00:01:52.460> route<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:53.119> but<00:01:53.270> that

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
have the longer route here but that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.179 
have the longer route here but that
longer<00:01:53.659> route<00:01:53.960> isn't<00:01:54.140> dramatically<00:01:54.950> dark

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
longer route isn't dramatically dark

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.880 
longer route isn't dramatically dark
it's<00:01:55.430> basically<00:01:55.790> just<00:01:55.880> like<00:01:56.140> 1/8<00:01:57.140> whereas<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it's basically just like 1/8 whereas the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.020 
it's basically just like 1/8 whereas the
rest<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.579> probably<00:01:58.790> going<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:58.969> be

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
rest of this is probably going to be

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.209 
rest of this is probably going to be
more<00:01:59.180> like<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.750> know<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.110> twelve<00:02:00.649> or<00:02:00.770> fourteen

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
and it's very very pretty

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.420 
and it's very very pretty
so<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.700> fringe<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.890> 7.5<00:02:42.890> inches<00:02:43.280> so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
so the fringe on this is 7.5 inches so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.310 
so the fringe on this is 7.5 inches so
it's<00:02:43.579> definitely<00:02:44.030> meant<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:44.810> swept<00:02:45.049> off<00:02:45.170> to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
it's definitely meant to be swept off to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.780 
it's definitely meant to be swept off to
the<00:02:45.410> side<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.859> that<00:02:46.040> way<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.220> manufacturer

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the side it's that way the manufacturer

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.360 
the side it's that way the manufacturer
pictures<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:48.230> crown<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.769> ten<00:02:49.040> point<00:02:49.340> three

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
pictures the crown is ten point three

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.759 
pictures the crown is ten point three
inches<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:49.790> quite<00:02:50.150> long<00:02:50.420> quite<00:02:51.200> long<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.590> ends

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
inches so quite long quite long it ends

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.460 
inches so quite long quite long it ends
right<00:02:51.950> around<00:02:52.160> here<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:53.480> nape<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.959> four<00:02:54.200> point

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
right around here the nape is four point

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.900 
right around here the nape is four point
two<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.040> short<00:02:55.280> I'll<00:02:55.430> show<00:02:55.609> you<00:02:55.670> when<00:02:55.880> I

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
two so it's short I'll show you when I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.759 
two so it's short I'll show you when I
turn<00:02:56.269> around<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.840> gets<00:02:57.109> shorter<00:02:57.290> because<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
turn around it gets shorter because the

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.130 
turn around it gets shorter because the
curl<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.300> overall<00:02:59.599> weight<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.959> around

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
curl to and the overall weight is around

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.800 
curl to and the overall weight is around
three<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.650> half<00:03:00.830> ounce

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
three and a half ounce

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.030 
three and a half ounce
so<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.080> what<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> mall<00:03:03.470> looks<00:03:03.650> like<00:03:03.860> from

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
