in a custom version this is the SMF

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.490 
in a custom version this is the SMF
version<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.099> comes<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.519> dog<00:00:14.820> grind

very very nicely browned it has a stunt
double<00:00:20.810> finish<00:00:21.810> which<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> stone<00:00:22.590> wash<00:00:22.800> over

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
double finish which is a stone wash over

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.519 
double finish which is a stone wash over
here<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.550> built<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.230> called<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
here and built I think it's called a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.849 
here and built I think it's called a
build<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:25.920> satin<00:00:26.340> finish<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.930> grinds<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
build or satin finish on the grinds and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.600 
build or satin finish on the grinds and
stretchy<00:00:29.279> open<00:00:29.640> top<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> blades<00:00:32.040> been<00:00:32.279> ground

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
stretchy open top the blades been ground

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.810 
stretchy open top the blades been ground
really<00:00:33.120> nicely<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.489> for<00:00:35.489> easy

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
really nicely as you can see for easy

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.840 
really nicely as you can see for easy
penetration<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.770> for<00:00:37.770> easy<00:00:37.950> slicing<00:00:40.850> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
penetration and for easy slicing the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.549 
penetration and for easy slicing the
thing<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> same<00:00:42.989> thing<00:00:43.440> it's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
thing is is about the same thing it's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.580 
thing is is about the same thing it's
probably<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> same<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> product<00:00:44.850> knife<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
probably the same as the product knife I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
probably the same as the product knife I
don't<00:00:46.590> remember<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:47.280> much<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> i<00:00:48.059> think

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
don't remember how much is it i think

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
don't remember how much is it i think
it's<00:00:49.190> 0.19<00:00:53.239> inch<00:00:54.239> steak<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.610> anyway<00:00:58.190> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it's 0.19 inch steak I think anyway the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
it's 0.19 inch steak I think anyway the
difference<00:00:59.579> between<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
difference between this one and the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.539 
difference between this one and the
other<00:01:02.059> mixed<00:01:03.059> rider<00:01:03.239> customs<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:05.100> this

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
other mixed rider customs is that this

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.039 
other mixed rider customs is that this
one<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.790> full<00:01:06.240> titanium<00:01:07.010> handle<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:09.479> comes<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
one is full titanium handle it comes to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
one is full titanium handle it comes to
titanium<00:01:10.380> frame<00:01:11.040> lock<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.890> titanium<00:01:14.000> from

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
titanium frame lock and titanium from

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
titanium frame lock and titanium from
size<00:01:15.299> scale<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.610> titanium<00:01:17.610> backspacer<00:01:19.040> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
size scale and titanium backspacer the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.399 
size scale and titanium backspacer the
Titanium's<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.880> in

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
Titanium's as you can see here are in

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
Titanium's as you can see here are in
orange<00:01:25.409> peel<00:01:25.820> texture<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.259> nice<00:01:29.479> it

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
orange peel texture it's really nice it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
orange peel texture it's really nice it
gives<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.409> more<00:01:31.710> traction

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
gives you a little bit more traction

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
gives you a little bit more traction
than<00:01:34.369> let's<00:01:35.369> say<00:01:35.490> compared<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> smoothness

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
than let's say compared to a smoothness

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.730 
than let's say compared to a smoothness
of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> carbon<00:01:38.100> fiber<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:40.170> been<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
of the carbon fiber and it's been I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
of the carbon fiber and it's been I
think<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.579> been<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.909> hit<00:01:44.060> flame-colored<00:01:45.380> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
think it's been a hit flame-colored so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.179 
think it's been a hit flame-colored so
there<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:46.979> different<00:01:48.049> colors<00:01:49.049> showing<00:01:49.500> from

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there are different colors showing from

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.289 
there are different colors showing from
a<00:01:50.460> different<00:01:50.939> angle<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:52.530> chose<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> purple

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
a different angle I chose a purple

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
a different angle I chose a purple
brownish<00:01:55.200> coldish<00:01:56.360> pepper<00:01:57.360> colors

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
brownish coldish pepper colors

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.230 
brownish coldish pepper colors
I<00:02:00.590> really<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.860> night<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.909> think

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
I really like this night because I think

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
I really like this night because I think
theoretically<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.899> impractical<00:02:07.289> because<00:02:07.829> I

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
theoretically not impractical because I

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.270 
theoretically not impractical because I
haven't<00:02:08.550> never<00:02:08.989> had<00:02:09.989> used<00:02:10.289> any<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.129> these

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
haven't never had used any of these

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.380 
haven't never had used any of these
knives<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:12.470> think<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:13.739> the--<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.340> theory<00:02:14.910> this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
knives I think in the-- in theory this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.339 
knives I think in the-- in theory this
one<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.750> stronger<00:02:16.500> than<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.400> g10<00:02:18.300> or<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.660> cup<00:02:19.319> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
one is stronger than the g10 or a cup of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.690 
one is stronger than the g10 or a cup of
fiber<00:02:19.620> version<00:02:20.900> although<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:23.160> g10<00:02:23.550> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
fiber version although the g10 and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.309 
fiber version although the g10 and
carbon<00:02:24.000> fiber<00:02:24.209> version<00:02:24.420> comes<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.019> one

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
carbon fiber version comes with one

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.699 
carbon fiber version comes with one
piece<00:02:27.260> frame<00:02:28.519> side<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.470> come

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
piece frame side and this is this come

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.479 
piece frame side and this is this come
with<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> three<00:02:32.430> piece<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:34.489> frame

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
with a three piece which is the frame

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.220 
with a three piece which is the frame
lock<00:02:36.590> frame<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.150> back<00:02:39.150> spacer<00:02:40.310> but<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.930> comes

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
lock frame and back spacer but it comes

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.589 
lock frame and back spacer but it comes
with<00:02:43.349> four<00:02:44.099> screws<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.670> one<00:02:44.880> side<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.390> another

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
with four screws on one side and another

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.500 
with four screws on one side and another
four<00:02:46.140> screws<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.799> other<00:02:47.040> side<00:02:47.510> which

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
four screws on the other side which

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.640 
four screws on the other side which
tightened<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:50.579> skill<00:02:50.849> really<00:02:52.160> firmly<00:02:53.180> so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
tightened the skill really firmly so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.220 
tightened the skill really firmly so
virtually<00:02:55.650> there<00:02:55.950> are<00:02:56.069> no<00:02:56.220> way<00:02:56.489> for<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.849> to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.240 

get<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.739> bug<00:03:02.340> spacer<00:03:02.640> loose<00:03:04.010> even<00:03:05.010> if<00:03:05.100> you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
get the bug spacer loose even if you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.530 
get the bug spacer loose even if you
lose<00:03:05.910> two<00:03:06.500> screws<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.799> still<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.540> six

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
lose two screws you still have like six

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.160 
lose two screws you still have like six
screws<00:03:09.720> holding<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.670> unlike<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.170> production

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.379 
screws holding it unlike the production

or the other customs they only have four
screws<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.049> going<00:03:19.319> through<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.100> way<00:03:20.250> to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
screws and going through all the way to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.640 
screws and going through all the way to
the<00:03:20.730> other<00:03:21.630> side<00:03:23.389> okay<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:25.139> titanium<00:03:25.530> back

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the other side okay the titanium back

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.550 
the other side okay the titanium back
spacer<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.220> very<00:03:26.549> nicely<00:03:27.450> done<00:03:28.049> it's<00:03:28.290> very

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
spacer is very nicely done it's very

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.199 
spacer is very nicely done it's very
flushed<00:03:30.290> easy<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> touch<00:03:32.180> actually<00:03:33.180> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
flushed easy to the touch actually I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.670 
flushed easy to the touch actually I
like<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.630> feel<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.489> titanium<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.970> hand

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
like the feel of the titanium in hand

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.569 
like the feel of the titanium in hand
because<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.859> very<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:39.540> has<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> good<00:03:40.109> weight

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
because it's very it has a good weight

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.280 
because it's very it has a good weight
but<00:03:41.579> it's<00:03:41.880> not<00:03:42.329> overly<00:03:43.019> heavy<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:45.290> probably

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
but it's not overly heavy it's probably

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.009 
but it's not overly heavy it's probably
around<00:03:48.530> seven<00:03:49.530> hours<00:03:50.389> which<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.599> little<00:03:51.930> bit

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
around seven hours which is a little bit

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.500 
around seven hours which is a little bit
heavier<00:03:52.799> probably<00:03:53.250> like<00:03:53.489> an<00:03:53.639> hour<00:03:53.819> saber<00:03:54.180> than

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
heavier probably like an hour saber than

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.809 
heavier probably like an hour saber than
the<00:03:55.190> g1000<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.430> carbon<00:03:56.849> fiber<00:03:57.000> version<00:03:57.560> but

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
the g1000 a carbon fiber version but

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.699 
the g1000 a carbon fiber version but
it's<00:04:00.819> just<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.390> just<00:04:01.569> true<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:02.470> just

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
it's just it just true it's you just

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.860 
it's just it just true it's you just
feel<00:04:02.920> much<00:04:03.099> stronger<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:04.090> can't<00:04:04.299> even<00:04:04.420> strike

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
feel much stronger you can't even strike

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.009 
feel much stronger you can't even strike
it<00:04:05.110> or<00:04:05.409> if<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.829> drop<00:04:06.159> it<00:04:09.599> it<00:04:10.599> will<00:04:10.750> not

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
it or if you drop it it will not

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.149 
it or if you drop it it will not
actually<00:04:11.439> hurt<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:11.920> knife<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.930> clip<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.560> very

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
actually hurt the knife the clip is very

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.969 
actually hurt the knife the clip is very
strong<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.909> think<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.840> clips<00:04:17.109> way<00:04:17.380> too<00:04:17.530> strong

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
strong I think the clips way too strong

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.770 
strong I think the clips way too strong
for<00:04:18.250> me<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:21.100> night<00:04:21.340> will<00:04:21.609> not<00:04:21.820> get<00:04:22.120> out<00:04:22.389> of

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
for me the night will not get out of

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.230 
for me the night will not get out of
your<00:04:22.870> pants<00:04:23.350> once<00:04:23.979> in<00:04:24.570> once<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.720> clip<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.020> in

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
your pants once in once you clip it in

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.420 
your pants once in once you clip it in
okay<00:04:28.240> are<00:04:28.509> the<00:04:28.750> blade<00:04:31.169> it's<00:04:32.169> pretty<00:04:32.680> centered

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
okay are the blade it's pretty centered

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.719 
okay are the blade it's pretty centered
I<00:04:33.789> wouldn't<00:04:34.419> say<00:04:34.889> dead<00:04:35.889> center<00:04:36.340> but<00:04:36.550> it's

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
I wouldn't say dead center but it's

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.120 
I wouldn't say dead center but it's
pretty<00:04:37.000> centered<00:04:39.990> everything<00:04:40.990> else<00:04:41.199> it's

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
pretty centered everything else it's

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.490 
pretty centered everything else it's
just<00:04:42.400> as<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.580> as<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.150> custom<00:04:43.660> should<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:44.020> it's<00:04:44.260> in

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
just as a as a custom should be it's in

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.159 
just as a as a custom should be it's in
perfect<00:04:44.800> condition<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:49.570> log<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:49.960> very

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
perfect condition the the log is very

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.300 
perfect condition the the log is very
easy<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.560> open<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.610> knife<00:04:51.849> smooth<00:04:52.800> make<00:04:53.800> do

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
easy to open the knife smooth make do

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.339 
easy to open the knife smooth make do
some<00:04:54.729> cut<00:04:55.000> cut<00:04:55.510> out<00:04:55.630> here<00:04:56.050> and<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:58.449> big<00:04:58.690> big<00:04:59.020> cut

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
some cut cut out here and a big big cut

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.400 
some cut cut out here and a big big cut
cut<00:04:59.710> out<00:04:59.830> here<00:05:00.190> so<00:05:00.910> it's<00:05:01.539> very<00:05:01.750> easy<00:05:01.900> for<00:05:02.169> you

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
cut out here so it's very easy for you

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.240 
cut out here so it's very easy for you
to<00:05:02.560> disengage<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.580> but<00:05:04.419> at<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.840> same<00:05:05.050> time<00:05:05.289> it

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
to disengage it but at the same time it

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.820 
to disengage it but at the same time it
feels<00:05:07.000> really<00:05:07.090> secure<00:05:07.750> in<00:05:07.870> hand<00:05:10.260> it's<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.620> it

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
feels really secure in hand it's the it

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.439 
feels really secure in hand it's the it
says<00:05:12.039> mixed<00:05:12.400> writer<00:05:12.610> here<00:05:13.060> it's<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.419> I

says mixed writer here it's a I

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.070

our s35vn it's written here I believe as

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.480 
our s35vn it's written here I believe as
you<00:05:24.030> handle<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.150> knife<00:05:25.360> over<00:05:26.349> time<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:27.190> color

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
you handle the knife over time the color

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.950 
you handle the knife over time the color
we<00:05:27.789> will<00:05:28.120> change<00:05:28.510> I<00:05:30.599> think<00:05:31.599> that's<00:05:31.720> really

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
we will change I think that's really

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960 
we will change I think that's really
cool<00:05:32.169> that's<00:05:32.530> one<00:05:32.710> of<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.949> that's<00:05:33.190> one<00:05:33.789> cool

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
cool that's one of the that's one cool

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.589 
cool that's one of the that's one cool
feature<00:05:34.030> of<00:05:34.630> this<00:05:34.780> knife<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:37.120> think<00:05:37.449> that

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
feature of this knife and I think that

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.850 
feature of this knife and I think that
that's<00:05:37.630> about<00:05:38.139> it<00:05:39.449> if<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:40.810> were<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.320> have<00:05:41.560> only

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
that's about it if I were to have only

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.879 
that's about it if I were to have only
one<00:05:42.220> driver<00:05:42.880> i'll<00:05:43.840> probably<00:05:44.110> get<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.560> full

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
one driver i'll probably get the full

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.710 
one driver i'll probably get the full
titanium<00:05:45.599> handle<00:05:46.599> version<00:05:48.539> because<00:05:49.539> i<00:05:49.659> think

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
titanium handle version because i think

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.040 
titanium handle version because i think
it's<00:05:50.020> the

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
it's the

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.589 
it's the
it's<00:05:51.409> the<00:05:51.919> stronger<00:05:53.409> knife<00:05:54.409> in<00:05:54.740> theory<00:05:55.599> such

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
it's the stronger knife in theory such

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.980 
it's the stronger knife in theory such
as<00:05:56.870> this<00:05:57.289> weak<00:05:57.800> point<00:05:58.159> for<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:59.389> g1000<00:05:59.780> the

carbon fiber version when when you drop

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.890 
carbon fiber version when when you drop
it<00:06:02.479> really<00:06:02.990> hard<00:06:03.789> you<00:06:04.789> might<00:06:04.940> break<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.330> but

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
it really hard you might break it but

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.200 
it really hard you might break it but
you<00:06:06.259> won't<00:06:06.530> break<00:06:06.770> it<00:06:06.979> if<00:06:07.220> it's<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.900> titanium

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
you won't break it if it's a titanium

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.279 
you won't break it if it's a titanium
what<00:06:11.210> else<00:06:11.389> oh<00:06:12.039> that's<00:06:13.039> a<00:06:13.129> body<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:13.430> guess

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
what else oh that's a body that guess

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:23.150 
what else oh that's a body that guess
some<00:06:15.289> close<00:06:15.530> shots<00:06:15.830> here

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.300 

really<00:06:23.940> green<00:06:24.180> I<00:06:24.360> so<00:06:24.630> another<00:06:25.530> thing<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:26.100> that

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
really green I so another thing is that

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.330 
really green I so another thing is that
that<00:06:26.700> bomb<00:06:27.120> you<00:06:27.330> see<00:06:27.510> here<00:06:27.840> inside<00:06:28.560> unless

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
that bomb you see here inside unless

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.160 
that bomb you see here inside unless
that's<00:06:29.880> actually<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.300> blade<00:06:31.020> stop<00:06:32.660> ok<00:06:33.660> on<00:06:33.900> the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
that's actually a blade stop ok on the

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.650 
that's actually a blade stop ok on the
g10<00:06:34.590> or<00:06:34.800> carbon<00:06:35.220> fibers<00:06:35.640> you<00:06:35.880> will<00:06:36.030> bump<00:06:36.450> it

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
g10 or carbon fibers you will bump it

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.320 
g10 or carbon fibers you will bump it
and<00:06:36.840> bump<00:06:37.140> it<00:06:37.290> every<00:06:38.250> time<00:06:38.430> you<00:06:38.550> close<00:06:38.790> it<00:06:38.850> the

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
and bump it every time you close it the

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.070 
and bump it every time you close it the
knife<00:06:39.540> over<00:06:40.440> time<00:06:40.970> the<00:06:41.970> g10<00:06:42.300> will<00:06:42.480> work<00:06:42.690> we'll

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
knife over time the g10 will work we'll

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.360 
knife over time the g10 will work we'll
get<00:06:43.470> that<00:06:43.620> one<00:06:43.920> out<00:06:44.150> not<00:06:45.150> with<00:06:45.930> the<00:06:46.370> titanium

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
get that one out not with the titanium

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.710 
get that one out not with the titanium
or<00:06:47.550> maybe<00:06:48.270> it's<00:06:49.020> much<00:06:49.320> harder<00:06:49.590> for<00:06:50.160> you<00:06:50.280> to<00:06:50.310> our

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
or maybe it's much harder for you to our

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.850 
or maybe it's much harder for you to our
wear<00:06:51.720> out<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:53.400> titanium<00:06:53.940> so<00:06:54.240> that's<00:06:54.450> another

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
wear out the titanium so that's another

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.970 
wear out the titanium so that's another
feature<00:06:55.860> that<00:06:56.100> I<00:06:56.490> like<00:06:57.590> one<00:06:58.590> of<00:06:58.620> the<00:06:58.800> things

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
feature that I like one of the things

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.510 
feature that I like one of the things
that<00:06:59.100> I<00:06:59.640> think<00:06:59.850> makes<00:07:00.630> still<00:07:00.950> rely<00:07:01.950> only<00:07:02.220> on

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
that I think makes still rely only on

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.340 
that I think makes still rely only on
one<00:07:02.850> thumb<00:07:03.150> stud<00:07:03.480> on<00:07:04.410> to<00:07:05.250> rest<00:07:05.490> when<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.390> blade

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
one thumb stud on to rest when the blade

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.810 
one thumb stud on to rest when the blade
is<00:07:07.530> open<00:07:07.940> it<00:07:08.940> seems<00:07:09.390> and<00:07:09.960> that<00:07:10.530> it's<00:07:11.340> touching

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
is open it seems and that it's touching

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.620 
is open it seems and that it's touching
but<00:07:12.620> if<00:07:13.620> you<00:07:13.770> look<00:07:13.950> closely<00:07:14.250> I<00:07:14.790> think<00:07:15.420> there's

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
but if you look closely I think there's

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.870 
but if you look closely I think there's
still<00:07:16.110> a<00:07:16.170> very<00:07:16.410> tiny<00:07:16.740> gap<00:07:17.070> so<00:07:17.520> on<00:07:19.490> not<00:07:20.490> not

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
still a very tiny gap so on not not

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.470 
still a very tiny gap so on not not
because<00:07:21.270> it's<00:07:21.540> both<00:07:22.080> on<00:07:22.350> titanium<00:07:22.920> make<00:07:23.520> press

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:24.480 
because it's both on titanium make press

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.730 
because it's both on titanium make press
the<00:07:24.720> thumb<00:07:24.960> stuck<00:07:25.230> on<00:07:25.710> both<00:07:25.950> sides<00:07:27.530> but<00:07:28.530> it

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
the thumb stuck on both sides but it

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.810 
the thumb stuck on both sides but it
still<00:07:29.570> it<00:07:30.570> will<00:07:30.810> not<00:07:31.020> wear<00:07:31.320> out<00:07:31.350> the<00:07:31.830> g10<00:07:32.580> or

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820 
still it will not wear out the g10 or

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.900 
still it will not wear out the g10 or
carbon<00:07:33.180> fiber<00:07:33.390> if<00:07:33.690> you<00:07:33.870> ever<00:07:34.140> touches<00:07:34.710> it<00:07:34.910> so

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:35.910 
carbon fiber if you ever touches it so

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.200 
carbon fiber if you ever touches it so
still<00:07:36.420> a<00:07:36.660> stronger<00:07:37.200> in<00:07:37.350> design<00:07:37.680> a<00:07:38.120> little<00:07:39.120> bit

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
still a stronger in design a little bit

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.760 
still a stronger in design a little bit
heavier<00:07:39.540> but<00:07:39.720> as<00:07:40.380> well<00:07:40.710> it's<00:07:41.640> worth<00:07:41.880> the<00:07:42.090> wait

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:42.770 
heavier but as well it's worth the wait

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.909 
heavier but as well it's worth the wait
the<00:07:43.770> wait<00:07:43.800> is<00:07:43.980> worth<00:07:44.100> it<00:07:44.490> right<00:07:45.710> thank<00:07:46.710> you<00:07:46.800> for

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 
the wait is worth it right thank you for

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:49.040 
the wait is worth it right thank you for
watching
