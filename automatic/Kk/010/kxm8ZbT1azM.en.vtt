whatsoever

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
whatsoever

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.880 
whatsoever
so<00:06:33.750> I'm<00:06:33.900> just<00:06:34.050> going<00:06:34.170> to<00:06:34.230> have<00:06:34.350> to<00:06:34.410> explain

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
so I'm just going to have to explain

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.740 
so I'm just going to have to explain
what<00:06:35.220> happens<00:06:36.410> and<00:06:37.580> it's<00:06:38.580> not<00:06:38.760> a<00:06:38.790> huge<00:06:39.240> loss<00:06:39.510> I

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
what happens and it's not a huge loss I

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.880 
what happens and it's not a huge loss I
don't<00:06:39.900> think<00:06:40.050> there<00:06:40.170> are<00:06:40.230> actually<00:06:40.710> many

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
don't think there are actually many

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.150 
don't think there are actually many
movies<00:06:41.490> in<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:42.180> game<00:06:42.560> especially<00:06:43.560> in<00:06:43.620> this

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
movies in the game especially in this

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.610 
movies in the game especially in this
one<00:06:44.460> there<00:06:45.150> are<00:06:45.300> movies<00:06:45.660> I<00:06:45.840> believe<00:06:46.200> the

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
one there are movies I believe the

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.970 
one there are movies I believe the
beginning<00:06:47.190> of<00:06:47.310> every<00:06:47.550> chapter<00:06:47.820> and<00:06:48.090> this

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
beginning of every chapter and this

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.410 
beginning of every chapter and this
chalice<00:06:49.980> of<00:06:50.010> unretired<00:06:50.610> only<00:06:50.910> has<00:06:51.090> two

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
chalice of unretired only has two

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.540 
chalice of unretired only has two
chapters<00:06:53.000> so<00:06:54.000> that's<00:06:54.360> all<00:06:54.630> good

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.390 

and<00:06:57.640> hopefully<00:06:58.440> this<00:06:59.440> will<00:06:59.710> start<00:07:00.190> the

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
and hopefully this will start the

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.880 
and hopefully this will start the
beginning<00:07:00.760> of<00:07:00.880> all<00:07:01.390> of<00:07:01.420> my<00:07:01.690> fraps<00:07:01.990> LPS<00:07:02.560> on<00:07:02.740> my
