 hi all these fish to youtube and in 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.610
 this video I'm going to show you the 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.520
 difference start time between 6 and 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.820
 years 7 the irun 4 that I have to my 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.370
 left has them 6 in their version 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.750
 6.1 point 3 as you can see here below and 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.580
 the iphone 4 that I have on the right 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.160
 it has 7 in its version 7.0 as you can 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.390
 see here below good let's proceed to 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.390
 turn both off at the same time 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.630
 as we turned off 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.630
 and we are going to understand them at the same time 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.350
 As you can see the apple has appeared at the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.300
 it's worth it and let's see what device 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.270
 of the two lights first I remember you 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.580
 that the one on the left is 16 and the one on 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.580
 the right has them 7 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.860
 as you can see the iphone on the left that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 it has year 6 it has turned on much more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.479
 faster than the one that has the 7 that in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.510
 these moments have lighting up let's 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.960
 to see how long it takes to turn on 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.040
 and good as you see years 6 is still 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.660
 much faster than year 7 well I'll go 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.560
 to invite all those who have 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.710
 install it there is the 7.0 already to which I 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.540
 So you say good that you have problems 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.420
 extended if you really think it's going 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.370
 much slower or what you want me 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.220
 counting is worth what you think it is 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.770
 worse that there is a good 7 if you liked 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.720
