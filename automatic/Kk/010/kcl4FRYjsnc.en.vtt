hey<00:00:00.690> what's<00:00:00.960> up<00:00:01.079> guys<00:00:01.260> it's<00:00:01.290> brackish<00:00:01.800> ghost

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:02.149 
hey what's up guys it's brackish ghost

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey what's up guys it's brackish ghost
I'm<00:00:03.149> getting<00:00:03.389> Reyes<00:00:03.629> switch<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.410> rail

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
I'm getting Reyes switch the rail

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.499 
I'm getting Reyes switch the rail
systems<00:00:05.370> from<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.670> originally<00:00:06.210> equipped

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
systems from the originally equipped

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.580 
systems from the originally equipped
rail<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.950> came<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.429> LWRC<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.590> much

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
rail that came on my LWRC to the much

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.369 
rail that came on my LWRC to the much
lighter<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:10.980> much<00:00:11.429> longer<00:00:13.250> samson<00:00:14.250> evo<00:00:14.940> rail

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.439 
lighter and much longer samson evo rail
but<00:00:16.379> while<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.100> figured<00:00:18.000> i'd<00:00:18.150> give<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
but while is at it figured i'd give you

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.210 
but while is at it figured i'd give you
all<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.990> look<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> gas<00:00:19.770> system<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:22.220> this

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
all a look at the gas system here this

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.630 
all a look at the gas system here this
clearly<00:00:24.260> is<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> gas<00:00:25.590> block<00:00:25.890> has<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> nozzle

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
clearly is a gas block has a nozzle

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.419 
clearly is a gas block has a nozzle
underneath<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.840> piston<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:29.099> cup

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
underneath it the piston is actually cup

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.410 
underneath it the piston is actually cup
the<00:00:29.970> pistons<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.949> female<00:00:31.949> end<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> most

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the pistons the female end of this most

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
the pistons the female end of this most
systems<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> male<00:00:34.320> end<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.770> goes<00:00:34.980> into

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
systems it's the male end and goes into

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.979 
systems it's the male end and goes into
the<00:00:35.550> gas<00:00:35.700> block<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> other<00:00:36.780> way

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the gas block but this is the other way

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
the gas block but this is the other way
around<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.250> rod<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.610> connects

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
around it's a little rod that connects

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.660 
around it's a little rod that connects
them<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.200> bar<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.829> continues

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
them and then this bar that continues

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 
them and then this bar that continues
through<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.510> bar<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.200> pushes

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
through is the bar that actually pushes

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
through is the bar that actually pushes
the<00:00:43.680> bolt<00:00:43.980> carrier<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.140> steel

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379

has<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:58.199> been<00:00:58.440> cleaned<00:00:58.770> and<00:01:00.649> probably<00:01:02.449> well

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
has not been cleaned and probably well

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
has not been cleaned and probably well
over<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.840> thousand<00:01:04.320> rounds<00:01:04.439> probably<00:01:04.979> like

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
over a thousand rounds probably like

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.880 
over a thousand rounds probably like
1,500<00:01:05.729> rounds<00:01:08.900> take<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> handguard<00:01:10.500> apart

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
1,500 rounds take the handguard apart

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.450 
1,500 rounds take the handguard apart
it's<00:01:11.070> filthy<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> inside<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:13.460> barely

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's filthy on the inside but barely

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's filthy on the inside but barely
anything<00:01:14.790> made<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> through<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.009> had<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.270> AFG<00:01:18.270> on

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
anything made it through I had a AFG on

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.490 
anything made it through I had a AFG on
there<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:20.880> carbon<00:01:21.270> dealt<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.140> I'll

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
there it was all carbon dealt but I'll

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
there it was all carbon dealt but I'll
take<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.830> thing<00:01:23.009> apart<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
take this thing apart so you can see a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
take this thing apart so you can see a
better<00:01:24.540> look<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
better look at it and here we have the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
better look at it and here we have the
parts<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> gas<00:01:29.369> system<00:01:30.049> it's<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
parts to the gas system it's just a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.859 
parts to the gas system it's just a
little<00:01:31.470> rod<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> connects<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.840> bar<00:01:33.840> that

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
little rod that connects on a bar that

the<00:01:45.090> exact<00:01:45.840> verbage<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.270> AR<00:01:48.270> gas<00:01:48.540> piston

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the exact verbage for a AR gas piston

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.700 
the exact verbage for a AR gas piston
system<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> piston<00:01:51.810> cup<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
system but this is the piston cup you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.550 
system but this is the piston cup you
can<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> has<00:01:53.540> three<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.930> exhaust

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
can see it has three little exhaust

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.660 
can see it has three little exhaust
ports<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.520> relieve<00:01:56.790> gas<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.640> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
scrape the inside of the cup next time

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.900 
scrape the inside of the cup next time
it<00:02:24.020> cycles<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.590> gas<00:02:24.740> blows<00:02:25.220> all<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.460> carbon

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
it cycles the gas blows all the carbon

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.650 
it cycles the gas blows all the carbon
out<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.210> holes<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:28.250> steadily<00:02:28.660> scraping

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
out the holes so it's steadily scraping
