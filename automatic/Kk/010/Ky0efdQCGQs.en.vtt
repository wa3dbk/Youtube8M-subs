00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
different than other Tampax is if crap I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.870 
different than other Tampax is if crap I
think<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.920> trying<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.250> appeal<00:01:11.610> to

think it's trying to like appeal to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
think it's trying to like appeal to
younger<00:01:12.270> girls<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> different<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
younger age groups and just our overall

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.780 
younger age groups and just our overall
design<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.950> feel<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> box<00:01:29.520> feels

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
design in the feel of the box feels

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
design in the feel of the box feels
quite<00:01:29.939> young<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.299> isn't<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> bad<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:30.990> but

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
quite young which isn't a bad thing but

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
quite young which isn't a bad thing but
I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:31.829> Tampax<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.400> trying

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I think that is what Tampax are trying

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.399 
I think that is what Tampax are trying
to<00:01:32.610> appeal<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> box<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.259> not

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to appeal to as you see the box is not

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.649 
to appeal to as you see the box is not
very<00:01:34.619> big<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.189> fits<00:01:35.460> nicely<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.240> both<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> my
