00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
using this is one of the adjusting bolt

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
using this is one of the adjusting bolt
which<00:00:26.189> moves<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.390> back<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
which moves it there and back and the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.089 
which moves it there and back and the
other<00:00:28.410> ones<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.789> other<00:00:29.970> side<00:00:30.300> right<00:00:30.599> here

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
other ones on the other side right here

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
other ones on the other side right here
this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.369> bolt<00:00:32.790> which<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.570> holding

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this is the bolt which will be holding

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
this is the bolt which will be holding
your<00:00:34.170> camera<00:00:35.239> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.690> handle<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.770> are

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
your camera this is that handle you are

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.950 
your camera this is that handle you are
carrying<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.460> tested<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
carrying it with it tested all here so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.799 
carrying it with it tested all here so
you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.440> set<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.760> device<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.570> are

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you can set it up on device when you are

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.799 
you can set it up on device when you are
balancing<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> actually<00:00:48.149> great

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
balancing it which is actually great

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
balancing it which is actually great
because<00:00:48.860> balancing<00:00:49.860> tangle<00:00:50.280> takes<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
because balancing tangle takes a lot of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
because balancing tangle takes a lot of
time<00:00:52.699> this<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.350> extended<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.070> down

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
time this can be extended up and down

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.990 
time this can be extended up and down
again<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.149> adjustments<00:00:58.190> these<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.670> be

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
again for adjustments these can be

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.560 
again for adjustments these can be
removed<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.109> weights<00:01:01.879> right<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
removed the weights right now I have the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109 
removed the weights right now I have the
full<00:01:03.870> amount<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.409> weights<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
full amount of weights also they can be

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.590 
full amount of weights also they can be
slided<00:01:06.570> towards<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> center<00:01:08.390> there<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
slided towards to the center there and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.370 
slided towards to the center there and
back<00:01:09.930> yeah<00:01:10.350> both<00:01:10.680> sides<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> same<00:01:12.380> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380

Ella lens and that HD 1001 it cept there

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.179 
Ella lens and that HD 1001 it cept there
was<00:01:37.770> slight<00:01:38.130> problem<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.869> focus<00:01:40.500> ring<00:01:40.829> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
was slight problem the focus ring is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.380 
was slight problem the focus ring is
actually<00:01:42.030> touching<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.920> body<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.759> HD

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
actually touching the body of the HD

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.749 
actually touching the body of the HD
1000<00:01:46.820> use<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.759> make

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
1000 use it that way and I have to make

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.590 
1000 use it that way and I have to make
the<00:01:51.270> adapter<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.549> how<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.850> looks<00:01:53.880> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the adapter so this is how it looks it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.149 
the adapter so this is how it looks it's
little<00:01:54.960> adapter<00:01:55.850> with<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.180> protective

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
little adapter with some protective

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
little adapter with some protective
material<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> doesn't<00:02:00.030> scratch<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
material that it doesn't scratch the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.410 
material that it doesn't scratch the
body<00:02:01.579> which<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.759> already<00:02:02.939> scratch

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
body which i already scratch

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
body which i already scratch
unfortunately<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> will<00:02:04.829> show<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.100> how<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
unfortunately and I will show you how it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.819 
unfortunately and I will show you how it
looks<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.229> how

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
looks with it so here you can see how

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.580 
looks with it so here you can see how
the<00:02:07.890> doctor<00:02:08.729> lifted<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the doctor lifted and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.520 
the doctor lifted and
their<00:02:09.769> body<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.580> therefore<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.930> lens<00:02:12.170> that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
their body and therefore the lens that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.270 
their body and therefore the lens that
is<00:02:12.680> finally<00:02:13.250> space<00:02:13.610> between<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.530> problem

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
is finally space between this problem

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.550 
is finally space between this problem
was<00:02:17.060> only<00:02:17.599> for<00:02:17.870> 24<00:02:18.500> 105<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:20.260> filming<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:21.500> now

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
was only for 24 105 I filming right now

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.449 
was only for 24 105 I filming right now
with<00:02:21.980> 17<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:23.000> TL<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.660> other<00:02:24.260> lands<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.069> there

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
with 17 for TL and other lands and there

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.050 
with 17 for TL and other lands and there
is<00:02:25.580> no<00:02:25.790> problem<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.190> was<00:02:28.459> just

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
is no problem like that so that was just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.259 
is no problem like that so that was just
little<00:02:29.330> explanation<00:02:29.900> what<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.709> happen<00:02:31.269> if

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
little explanation what can happen if

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.039 
little explanation what can happen if
you<00:02:32.660> are<00:02:32.870> using<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.670> particular<00:02:34.970> lens<00:02:35.720> with

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
you are using that particular lens with

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:43.890 
you are using that particular lens with
this<00:02:37.000> Glidecam<00:02:38.140> HD<00:02:41.079> 1080<00:02:42.400> recommend<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.610> I

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this Glidecam HD 1080 recommend it I
