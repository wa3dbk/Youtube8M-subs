00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.129
 plastic to protect it from the cold 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:38.160

 I'm going to show two tomatoes that is already 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.230
 in process 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.230
 unless they are 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.960
 and take them from my advice they will have the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.670
 tomato juice like mine 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.950

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:25.869
 drip irrigation have prepared for it 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.869
 so he knew how to keep moisture 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.659
 they should only look for a container of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.330
 soda or bottle and adjust it well 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.890
 on 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.390
 a stick for the drip to fall 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.440
 drip and keep the soil moist and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 that's how the tomato can receive the single 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.939

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.670
