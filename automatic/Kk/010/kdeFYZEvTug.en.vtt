machine<00:02:35.319> color<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.370> nice<00:02:36.580> looks<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
machine color so nice looks like the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.800 
machine color so nice looks like the
face<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.850> pre<00:02:40.390> thick<00:02:41.190> coat<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.220> silver<00:02:42.910> what

is<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.100> face<00:02:45.100> there<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.580> uh<00:02:46.299> this<00:02:48.000> reactor<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.030> a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
is a face there and uh this reactor is a

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.559 
is a face there and uh this reactor is a
little<00:02:49.540> bit<00:02:49.660> off<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.910> alright<00:02:52.239> it's<00:02:52.420> not

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569

that big of a deal and a splotch right

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.470 
that big of a deal and a splotch right
there<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:55.290> overall<00:02:56.290> these<00:02:56.860> are<00:02:57.480> pretty

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
there but overall these are pretty

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.449 
there but overall these are pretty
good-looking<00:02:58.989> sculpts<00:02:59.519> but<00:03:00.519> yeah<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.620> as<00:03:03.160> far

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.470 

and<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.160> other<00:03:32.280> side

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.589 

the<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:39.049> head<00:03:39.200> articulation<00:03:39.799> is<00:03:39.950> pretty<00:03:40.189> good

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
the the head articulation is pretty good

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.330 
the the head articulation is pretty good
as<00:03:41.599> far<00:03:41.870> as<00:03:41.930> how<00:03:42.140> far<00:03:42.379> they<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:42.620> look<00:03:42.709> up<00:03:42.920> they

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
as far as how far they can look up they

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.550 
as far as how far they can look up they
can<00:03:43.459> look<00:03:43.579> pretty<00:03:43.730> far<00:03:44.060> up<00:03:44.409> better<00:03:45.409> than

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
can look pretty far up better than

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.509 
can look pretty far up better than
others<00:03:47.170> like<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.650> meant<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.040> stuff<00:03:49.310> all

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
others like that I meant to stuff all

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.539 
others like that I meant to stuff all
the<00:03:49.730> Avengers<00:03:50.000> stuff<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:51.590> that's<00:03:52.069> about<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.519> I

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
the Avengers stuff but that's about it I

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.429 
the Avengers stuff but that's about it I
mean<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.000> can't<00:03:53.209> really<00:03:53.239> pose<00:03:53.629> them<00:03:53.870> give

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
mean you can't really pose them give

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.410 
mean you can't really pose them give
them<00:03:54.560> any<00:03:54.680> good<00:03:54.879> poses<00:03:55.879> or<00:03:56.030> anything<00:03:56.239> with

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
them any good poses or anything with

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.500 
them any good poses or anything with
that<00:03:56.629> but<00:03:56.900> yeah<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:58.069> guess<00:03:58.849> we'll<00:03:59.060> switch<00:03:59.329> out

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
that but yeah I guess we'll switch out

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.630 
that but yeah I guess we'll switch out
the<00:03:59.659> arms<00:04:00.019> but<00:04:00.920> I'm<00:04:01.220> not<00:04:01.340> gonna<00:04:01.519> bother

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
the arms but I'm not gonna bother

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.039 
the arms but I'm not gonna bother
switching<00:04:02.120> out<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.329> legs<00:04:02.510> because<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:02.930> are

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
switching out the legs because they are

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.059 
switching out the legs because they are
extremely<00:04:03.650> hard<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.720> peg<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.079> out<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.680> all

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
extremely hard to peg in and out so all

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.569 
extremely hard to peg in and out so all
right<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.599> as<00:04:08.599> far<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.620> arms<00:04:10.010> they<00:04:10.549> are

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
right and as far as the arms they are

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.030 
right and as far as the arms they are
really<00:04:11.000> bulky<00:04:11.389> I'm<00:04:11.989> not<00:04:12.170> sure<00:04:12.409> what<00:04:12.680> they<00:04:12.829> are

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
really bulky I'm not sure what they are

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.120 
really bulky I'm not sure what they are
exactly<00:04:13.459> for<00:04:13.849> but<00:04:14.239> oh<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:15.170> guess<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:15.680> peg<00:04:15.920> is

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
exactly for but oh I guess this peg is

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.009 
exactly for but oh I guess this peg is
full<00:04:16.310> for<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:18.280> missile<00:04:19.280> launcher<00:04:19.639> so<00:04:20.090> let's

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
full for that missile launcher so let's

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.550 
full for that missile launcher so let's
put<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.229> on

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
put it on

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.790 
put it on
okay<00:04:22.039> he's<00:04:22.190> like<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.580> guess<00:04:23.410> that's<00:04:24.410> where<00:04:24.590> this

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
okay he's like I guess that's where this

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.260 
okay he's like I guess that's where this
is<00:04:24.979> supposed<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.550> then<00:04:25.970> there's

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
is supposed to go and then there's

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.560 
is supposed to go and then there's
another<00:04:26.419> peg<00:04:26.919> back<00:04:27.919> there<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.520> guess<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.240> for

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
another peg back there I guess this for

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.750 
another peg back there I guess this for
for<00:04:29.960> his<00:04:30.050> backside<00:04:30.500> if<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.280> want<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.520> store<00:04:31.729> it

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
for his backside if you want to store it

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.210 
for his backside if you want to store it
