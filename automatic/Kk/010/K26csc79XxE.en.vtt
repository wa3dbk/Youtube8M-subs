matter
but<00:00:26.490> what's<00:00:26.670> annoying<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.760> gas<00:00:29.760> mileage

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
but what's annoying is the gas mileage

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.600 
but what's annoying is the gas mileage
so<00:00:31.199> when<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.560> got<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.009> truck<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.369> didn't

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.750 
have any sort of tonneau cover I may
have<00:00:34.680> mispronounced<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> know<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
have mispronounced that but you know the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
have mispronounced that but you know the
cover<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> goes<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> back<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> bed

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
cover that goes on the back of the bed

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
cover that goes on the back of the bed
and<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:39.000> gas<00:00:39.180> mileage<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.809> pretty<00:00:40.410> much

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and the gas mileage was pretty much

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.549 
and the gas mileage was pretty much
horrible<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> rugged<00:00:43.410> liner

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

and<00:00:50.070> I'll<00:00:50.129> include<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.460> link<00:00:50.700> within<00:00:50.910> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and I'll include a link within this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.360 
and I'll include a link within this
video<00:00:51.390> description<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.989> their<00:00:52.110> website<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
video description of their website but

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
video description of their website but
it's<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.850> great<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it's really great not just because it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
it's really great not just because it
makes<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> bed<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> truck<00:00:56.460> look<00:00:56.910> better

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
makes the bed of the truck look better

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.040 
makes the bed of the truck look better
but<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:58.680> significantly

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
but it's actually significantly

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.209 
but it's actually significantly
significantly<00:01:01.050> improved<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.590> gas<00:01:01.800> mileage

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
significantly improved my gas mileage

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
significantly improved my gas mileage
I've<00:01:02.340> been<00:01:02.520> been<00:01:03.480> all<00:01:03.629> over<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> country

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I've been been all over the country

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.000 
I've been been all over the country
recently<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> gas<00:01:06.720> mileage<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.860> don't

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
recently and the gas mileage and I don't

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
recently and the gas mileage and I don't
have<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> percentage<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:10.350> how<00:01:10.470> many<00:01:10.680> extra

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
have a percentage or for how many extra

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.219 
have a percentage or for how many extra
miles<00:01:12.030> per<00:01:12.180> gallon<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.600> getting<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
miles per gallon I'm getting but it is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.170 
miles per gallon I'm getting but it is
noticeable<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.640> put<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
noticeable because when I put that on

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
noticeable because when I put that on
there<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> gas<00:01:16.799> prices

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there not just because the gas prices

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630 
there not just because the gas prices
went<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.229> upon<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
went down but I get this upon the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
went down but I get this upon the
frequency<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.540> had<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> gas

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
frequency that I had to go to the gas

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380 
frequency that I had to go to the gas
station<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> tonneau<00:01:24.000> cover

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
station and when I put the tonneau cover

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.600 
station and when I put the tonneau cover
on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> rugged<00:01:25.049> liner<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.590> premium<00:01:26.400> vinyl

the<00:01:30.810> gas<00:01:30.960> station<00:01:31.470> were<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> lot<00:01:32.790> less<00:01:33.000> frequent

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the gas station were a lot less frequent

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
the gas station were a lot less frequent
and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.720> did<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.650> much<00:01:34.680> driving<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.000> just
