00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.819
 as announced here is the now 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:12.360
 to see modified mjx 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:16.770
 was installed a lrp 6900 kv with 40 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.029
 america the next or also 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.939
 changed is much higher than for 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.560
 original so the camera 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.740
 underneath pass because I would have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.789
 after before 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 otherwise the stern has been pole 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.250
 extended in the original it is about 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.989
 27 5 inches long now we are here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 at 43 cm 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.629
 at the hex but not around the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 So optical aspects should not be one 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.660
 bigger helicopters are actually 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.910
 but it's just one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 need 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.989
 in that the larger engine is installed 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.289
 So he is not of the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.899
 Power also affects torque 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.010
 opposite to the direction of rotation of the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 authors and now you could do that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.189
 heckrotor so change that to he 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.439
 performance increases 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.930
 to make up for the moment 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.299
 But you can also do the stern 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.400
 rod lengthen and the original engine 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 leave 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 but because the camera by her weight 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.619
 it does not have to be neglected 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.520
 a little over 90 93 grams fire test the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:31.200
 line something in front of the main rotor wants so 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 had to escape a bit 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.909
 weight to be increased so 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 finally the focus again 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.000
 on the main rotor shaft is told 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.240
 This was not about the visual aspect 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.880
 just that the helicopter with 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.939
 a camera that's coming out anyway 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.049
 There is another one that comes with the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.180
 view to the front 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.509
 the helicopter still capable of flight 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 stay here you can see the big one 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.829
 Comparison between an original wanted 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 modified mjx 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:12.959
 the cakes are voting from cfk 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 and the stern rod is also out 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.780
 cfk but of course no solid stuff like that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.769
 Then I opened the heli 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:32.970
 Here is the user brushless motor 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:35.970
 from sap the 6900 the engine installation 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.459
 was quite easy but at 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.090
 still a small problem 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.160
 and that must be the gear for the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.880
 Main drive installed upside down 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.819
 are usually heard once 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.190
 turned installed yes but not 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:59.489
 different because the little ten puzzles 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.880
 yes, unfortunately not optimal for it 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.510
 is 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.440
 I hope you can recognize and indeed 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.430
 runs down 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.790
 the payment runs weird and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.350
 Of course, that's good for you down here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.810
 you can adjust like no game 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.859
 and only in the upper area and so around 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 It is now seen in proportion 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.819
 a bid 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.049
 yes and that's why I have the dentists 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.030
 the other way around necessarily indulge 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.980
 can set reasonable play there 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.650
 there is another change and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.750
 Although it is then set long 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.850
 not directly below a base plate of the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.019
 frame but in between are two 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.519
 Rubber buffer in front and behind 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.980
 So altogether four and try the fair 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.049
 demonstrate 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.850
 the rubber doll have the task 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.579
 vibrations coming from above 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.430
 complete with the camera below 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.690
 because not too much of that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.180
 vibrations and vibrations still 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.200
 arrives that the pictures yes who just not 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.690
 you were like that and you are like that 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.370
 the vibration damper as I said 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.970
 four pieces amnesty through the actually 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.970
 perfectly adequate
