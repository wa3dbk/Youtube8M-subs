00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
 said 4 street fighter 5 and playstation 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.460
 or in the space you check now 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 river zap 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.340
 I'm henrique lima and this is the ps news 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.619
 during the expo 2015 the capcom revealed 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 new information on surge fighter 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.960
 rather the capcom's plans only launch the game 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.160
 with 16 characters being four of them 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.469
 unpublished 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.500
 it is possible that in the future new 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.079
 fighters but for barbato the fighters 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.559
 I do not think they're going to leave lcd. 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.239
 super mega blaster shock 9 if not you 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 will be able to buy them through a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.539
 coins that can also be purchased 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 with real money 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 but it is there at your discretion you already 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.090
 imagined playing ps an expensive space of course 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 that a little bit more is not possible 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.900
 he is very close to pluto about 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.840
 of 4.8 million kilometers is mpf 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.360
 The same processor used in the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 playstation 1 is it that helps honda 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.729
 reason to capture and transmit images 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 in high definition pluto to earth 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.009
 but then you ask me why they do not 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 are using ps2 cpu or good ps3 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.240
 abnormal did not leave the earth in 2006 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 he still preferred to use a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.159
 processor since it transmitted 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.140
 greater reliability and takes all without 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.970
 doubt one of the best exclusive for 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 playstation but you believe the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.290
 The daughter- in- law's staff and it hurts that the game 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.549
 could tarnish their image in a 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.950
 Exclusive interview for playstation 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.110
 store in conversation with the creators 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.200
 the director bruce coach felt that the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.640
 game would not perform well 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 they found this because they had several 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.460
 problems of the game's mechanics and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.530
 everything was fitting in the end they 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.479
 They took crucial decisions that resolved 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.890
 the problem and turn a game into a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.890
