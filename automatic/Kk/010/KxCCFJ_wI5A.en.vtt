 I the one who was coordinating ladder are looking for karate university in a 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.529
 little foot and that is 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.429
 that is, I think I will achieve what is fundamental for the person who is 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.110
 looking to study here is this as clinton is next is the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.040
 industry 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.640
 of throwing yesterday applied by you 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.730
 one to one to one to one without 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.310
 did not know this pronounced in the United States an innovation center this one 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.370
 contributes a lot to the local industry then this one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.340
 and the logical and ricky well where industry is located as for example the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.680
 Cinema industry 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.530
 at that time 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.420
 I also attended the appointment of universities that I tested in 500 kv and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.800
 workforce 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.730
 for those tutors of living cities in entertainment be the clearest case 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.330
 ennis if you read this if you want to study then from advertising 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.870
 the bad thing is that since he recovered and asia the east after because this is 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.540
 a chaos this of the angels 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.340
 where are the big advertising agencies and want to study 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.580
 biology 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.450
 in this place and and quiet private act with a hammer that you look for 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.730
 colleges 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.510
 what are they in the sector of the Christian Democratic leader in which this law 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.280
 in the list where there is a lot would choose 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.979
 as a proposal more facts that in this case will be in many this many great 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.210
 part companies this time was about to get in tune with the name of the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.930
 city 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.450
 which is important 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.010
 this epilogue but we are not going to pray 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.200
 that is clear and the city but other people in with the truth 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.610
 what is important that the university is in doubt because there was a sentence 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.240
 that they are strong and compact 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 this book is likely that the teacher although this is being studied 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.249
 currently for the things that help you 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.719
 to a poster in the field or entity work hard because it has contacts 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.059
 huge and industry 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.490
 I extend to the people that you know the congress 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.509
 the shcp that is also in that sector not then 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.379
 interests that ultimately after studying him 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.169
 percent and ing 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.409
 in the angels is prepared by having to play perera new york 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:34.809
 bauer we are not going to help to study a city that lives club barraca nickel 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.859
 can be a few practice of the stoker goalkeeper who close the teques 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.179
 having to look at us as for example what happens to many many students 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.839
 what studied 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.999
 this for example if I schools in boston 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.479
 problem is that many of them end up like the mica in candy found in one 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.979
 of the angels encounters 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.729
 this one to look for professional practices this term applied 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.979
 programs within your own university you program the hotel be for example 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.719
 university 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.029
 this the agents then sometimes end up playing little angels 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.639
 opportunity work age 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.519
 not then this one this Tuesday you might have to do double because you have 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.410
 to go to the agents because no better interpreter the angels 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.189
 live in los angeles meet people in los angeles 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.059
 i this crime is the fastest part in the labor market 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.059
 the place we are seeing that the site to another i 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.289
 I did not believe it but it was already late so nothing is sterile 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.540
 the topic of today i 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.879
 and then it approaches in the next edition of 2011 in Peru and in America 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:41.489
 in you
