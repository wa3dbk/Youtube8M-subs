00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.779
 but today's workshop is gabriel 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.550
 go take a look and continue on 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.849
 review of the red tide that everyone 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:17.850
 Became drooling yesterday, it 's beautiful, right? 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.470
 This red color calls attention to this 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 service step 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.720
 the gabriel removed some bearings removed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.599
 the bearings of the head to check 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 has some wear and tear on the bearings. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 loss of blood pressure 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.670
 oil from the bearings of the controls 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.780
 It 's a very common thing to happen. 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
 kind of thing 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.239
 if it does wear of the bearings is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.710
 loss of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.460
 oil pressure was also removed at 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.000
 below the total suspension of the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 aggregate is the subchassis for which you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.059
 carter to fall in galley floor then the guy 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 It's because it's cracked. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.869
 we will have a well-done weld made and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.409
 in the crankcase to leave a service well 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.530
 cool here in the elevator a little 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.590
 will withdraw the clutch warranty is the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.240
 new clutch making noise at 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.090
 people still do not know if it's a problem in the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.369
 new piece or if the expense is what is doing 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.000
 this goofy noise yellow beauty 1.6 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.780
 16 valves should be ready today looks 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.110
 the new bumpers on ridges 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.939
 damper mounted on the fact burgas 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:47.640
 front bumper new mounted here 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.490
 behind timing belt logical gate which 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.829
 gates i will not put dayco out 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.090
 no car to be held here 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.950
 no hi torque right? 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.430
 will not even gate timing belt 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.399
 sensors and now let's proceed 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.979
 the second part of the review that will be the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.509
 exchange removal for exchange 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.520
 clutch 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.100
 here they hit 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.170
 was leaking water leak 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.220
 is a plastic tube is a plastic tube of 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.630
 personal emotion 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.670
 the pipe that was cracked looks here 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.480
 your pipe here the water pipe that was 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.660
 cracked the clamp took over 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.600
 of this crack and with the hot engine this 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.450
 plastic material gave away and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.090
 masking the defect a bit when 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 Engines created began to leak water 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.480
 then it was only to replace this tube of 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.740
 water to solve the problem of 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.580
 leak is now from a hose 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.580
 also leaking 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.910
 That's it folks continuing the review 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.170
 of that sea is red oil pump 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.870
 new was made the car engine but not 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 the oil pump was replaced 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.530
 because of low pressure in the system 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.330
 publication the owner requested the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.810
 oil pump replacement 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.870
 the oil pump and the suction troupe 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.970
 that this famous oil fisherman there 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.290
 and the casing that was leaking was 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.630
 the position for us it gabriel only 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.170
 demonstrates the personal detail of the weld 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.900
 this guy was a botched soldering 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.550
 here is a very poorly welded weld 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.830
 Grossi said it was leaking in the 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.320
 Your own probe sent you here for a guy. 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.900
 very good here in the abraham neighborhood 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.390
 otherwise she made a better weld of better 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.390
 quality both on the outside and inside 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.670
 I just want solder inside. It's also the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.280
 ideal would be to exchange the card is 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.590
 more beast well a piece of $ 900 I go 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.140
 change because she broke up and gives 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.230
 to greet the problem of greeting letter is 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.660
 When you get here, crack the next face of 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.370
 contact with a block because it usually gives 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.130
 leak and it is useless to pass glue 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.550
 put gasket that continues leaking 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.220
 now in this case it will be perfect 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.580
 then try the oil pump mounted 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.450
 brand new 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.989
 Look at the horn of pure inspiration. 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.989
 all in place 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.560
 riding everything put in place with a 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.150
 silicon mount a subchassis after 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.110
 put an oil pressure wave to see 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.660
 if everything was nice in the air and 1.6 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.470
 valves today from where it is already starting 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.610
 then the transmission is not the gearbox 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.600
 to remove let's do the replacement 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:53.580
 of the clutch kit make the removal 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.220
 component has already withdrawn 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.350
 to sow madrid will take some more 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.289
 components and to remove the 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.570
 transmission that replace the medical kit 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.620
 complete 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.690
 This is it , guys, finishing the day. 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.360
 being alkyn 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.910
 I'm going to travel at the time a week off by 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.949
 leaving behind is this turbo tide going 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.520
 I'll be able to do a review. 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:23.250
 style has an ideological problem 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.830
 will be guarding part the sea is 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:30.490
 red the oil pump 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:34.010
 the crankcase is also fitted 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.350
 now is to run belt run with the 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.940
 gauge to see if everything will work out 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.830
 the oil pressure 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:45.740
 reinstatement we had the honor of receiving 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.620
 This turbo tide with the city's 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.710
 Sao Paulo but the owner of Brasilia 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.510
 searched the car in sÃ£o paulo passed by 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.680
 Belo Horizonte left the post to be 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.190
 reviewed 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.910
 will be done that ultra mega review 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.750
 blaster and then it comes from brasilia 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:15.470
 to get the car here in rhetoric 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:17.030
 the sea is 1.6 16 should be ready and by 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.669
 Your Monday I will not have 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.669
 opportunity to finalize 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.639
 so it's there I'm going to advance a staff one 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.580
 almost four thousand reais and the 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.440
 Who are you? 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.080
 almost four thousand reais but the car goes 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.750
 simply stay 0 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.500
 the sapphire has some more leaks 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.630
 wines that piece of paper and the two 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.330
 neighboring countries will also be 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.000
 beauty review this is it guys and ford 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.820
 ka also the owner said that he has a 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.260
 problem in valve and gr motor zetec 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.169
 rocks 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:57.860
 I find it strange that bgr never live in this 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.919
 car the boys the boys have turned 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.630
 So you can see what you 're getting 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:06.139
 beauty class is it 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.930
 next week has inside the sima 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.830
 show a hug and thanks for this 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.840
 week 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.840
 ball show we had
