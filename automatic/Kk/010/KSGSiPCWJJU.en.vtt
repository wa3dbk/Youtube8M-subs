10<00:00:22.650> x<00:00:22.830> 16<00:00:23.279> building<00:00:23.990> we<00:00:24.990> figured<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.160> it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
10 x 16 building we figured I think it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240 
10 x 16 building we figured I think it
was<00:00:26.519> 13<00:00:27.510> sheets<00:00:27.840> downstairs<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> could

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
was 13 sheets downstairs but you could

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
was 13 sheets downstairs but you could
get<00:00:29.429> ripped<00:00:29.699> let<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.800> waste<00:00:32.750> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
get ripped let you have some waste so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.560 
get ripped let you have some waste so
they<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.410> pieced<00:00:35.190> together<00:00:35.570> because

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
they could be pieced together because

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.069 
they could be pieced together because
we're<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.440> done<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.399> already<00:00:38.660> each<00:00:39.660> piece

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
we're not done and we already each piece

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.450 
we're not done and we already each piece
had<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> cut<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> far<00:00:43.680> we've<00:00:44.040> got<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> lot

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
had to be cut so far we've got a lot

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.220 
had to be cut so far we've got a lot
left<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> use<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.809> ceiling

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
left over and use that for the ceiling

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
left over and use that for the ceiling
we<00:00:46.590> haven't<00:00:46.890> bought<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> ceiling<00:00:47.640> stuff<00:00:47.910> yet

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
we haven't bought the ceiling stuff yet

done Kelly kind of trimmed around that
looks<00:02:38.190> pretty<00:02:38.460> good<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.180> just<00:02:39.390> where

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
looks pretty good and that's just where

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.290 
looks pretty good and that's just where
we<00:02:39.630> got<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.960> piled<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:41.220> got<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.640> fall<00:02:41.940> here

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
we got it piled up we got this fall here

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.500 
we got it piled up we got this fall here
done<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:44.300> we're<00:02:45.300> slowly<00:02:45.630> getting<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:47.300> we<00:02:48.300> got

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
done and we're slowly getting it we got

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.920 
done and we're slowly getting it we got
powered<00:02:49.170> all<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.560> plugs<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.930> everything

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
powered all the plugs and everything

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.290 
powered all the plugs and everything
it's<00:02:52.770> kind<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> slow<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.610> because<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.120> just

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
it's kind of a slow go because we just

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.840 
it's kind of a slow go because we just
kind<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.570> work<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> spurts<00:02:55.700> that's<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
kind of work on it the spurts that's a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.990 
kind of work on it the spurts that's a
good<00:02:57.030> thing<00:02:57.240> about<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.610> they<00:02:59.610> have<00:02:59.760> that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
good thing about it and they have that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.660 
good thing about it and they have that
cheat<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.140> pretty<00:03:02.070> easy<00:03:02.280> just

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
cheat like that just pretty easy just

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.490 
cheat like that just pretty easy just
stick<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.270> up<00:03:03.330> her<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.630> strip<00:03:03.870> down<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.380> know

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
stick it up her to strip down you know

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.790 
stick it up her to strip down you know
and<00:03:05.450> then<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.630> course<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:07.140> next<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.650> will

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
and then of course this next one will

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.310 
and then of course this next one will
have<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.100> trim<00:03:08.370> them<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> little<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:09.320> because

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
have to trim them a little bit because

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.100 
have to trim them a little bit because
of<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> plug<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:11.820> where<00:03:12.080> Kelly's<00:03:13.080> a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
of the plug and that's where Kelly's a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.180 
of the plug and that's where Kelly's a
well<00:03:13.710> or<00:03:14.480> detail<00:03:15.480> stuff<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.200> come<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.680> she<00:03:17.010> can

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
well or detail stuff can come in she can

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.600 
well or detail stuff can come in she can
figure<00:03:17.640> out<00:03:17.810> she'll<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.200> measure

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
figure out she'll have to measure

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.770 
figure out she'll have to measure
basically<00:03:20.610> from<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> edge<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.360> board

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
basically from the edge of that board

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.780 
basically from the edge of that board
over<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:23.150> then<00:03:25.040> or<00:03:26.040> whatever<00:03:26.370> she<00:03:26.459> does

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
over and then or whatever she does

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.940 
over and then or whatever she does
anyway<00:03:27.480> should<00:03:27.720> go<00:03:27.870> from<00:03:28.050> there<00:03:28.260> over<00:03:28.709> there

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
anyway should go from there over there

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.880 
anyway should go from there over there
measure<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.390> then<00:03:30.540> she'll<00:03:31.110> draw<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> line<00:03:31.620> now

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
measure and then she'll draw a line now

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.010 
measure and then she'll draw a line now
that<00:03:32.100> because<00:03:32.310> she'll<00:03:32.670> measure<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
that because she'll measure that and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.660 
that because she'll measure that and
then<00:03:34.140> she'll<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.470> exactly<00:03:35.160> where<00:03:35.310> they<00:03:35.430> hold

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
then she'll know exactly where they hold

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.510 
then she'll know exactly where they hold
a<00:03:35.790> cut<00:03:36.030> cut<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.860> that's<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.980> little<00:03:38.160> trial<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
a cut cut is that's a little trial and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.810 
a cut cut is that's a little trial and
error<00:03:38.760> deal<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.300> mean<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:40.709> know<00:03:40.800> this<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.489> it

error deal I mean you know this this it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.520 
error deal I mean you know this this it

know if you're not a car mirror you

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.060 
know if you're not a car mirror you
don't<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.140> do<00:03:46.320> with<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:46.770> you<00:03:46.890> got
