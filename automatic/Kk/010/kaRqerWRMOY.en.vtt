00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.670
 Considering the good weather, we will keep the first long weekend of the spring on Saturday. 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.780
 We meet on Flórián Square and leave the town on Szentendre Road. 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.869
 Some are joining the group even in Békás. 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.300
 Then Budakalász's destination will be Szentendre. 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.949
 All right. And then we roll over to Paprét, 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.429
 then we'll go down to Visegrád and turn back to Lepence. 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.509
 Sir ..... 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.960
 the majority... 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.980
 the majority decided to put down bikes at Skansen, 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 and the program is a two-hour community run. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.900
 Everyone is out of the room who's ever been 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.200
 heated 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.610
 swum 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 or both 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.200
 This is unacceptable! 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.500
 Absolutely unbearable! 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 Triathlon is not sport, just clowning! 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.800
 What's next? Water Ballet? 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.560
 I checked that Bata Peti went to KESZ every week. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.500
 Also, Kristof has had more runs than STRAVAN. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 This is a fucking cycling team. What do you mean by bicycle ?! 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 But Lord, since Armstrong started with a triathlon. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.000
 Yeah, that's what the bastard stuffed with all sorts of shit. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.800
 Sir, he told Opra that everyone was doing this. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.400
 I cut that yankee clown. I'm not going to run then. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.520
 Not a meter, the fucking life! 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.590
 Run only if you chase and just swim to stop drowning! 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.080
 You haven't read this in Velominat? 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.000
 Is this smafu for you? Did everyone's mind go? 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 What are we running in the forest, if you can twist it? 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.199
 Normal people do not even run after the bus. 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:24.199
 Do you think I'm blind? Can't I see Stravan rushing together? 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.059
 Adam has been lost, but at least you should be aware of 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.500
 It started so well. At last I thought that fate would bring people with meaningful people. 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.300
 They fixed the fixit and took their bikes. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.800
 It's winter ... 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.600
 Are you suddenly frightened of suddenly? 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.100
 Running? Triathlon? 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.900
 Yet, we have one and a half times more like us on Facebook than Utensil! 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.100
 Let's say this shame on them ... 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 It would be enough to put Kust out with a kitten and get caught! 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 But at least they are not running! 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 Do not Cry! We can still run at night. 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.200
 I wasn't disappointed at that time anymore. 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.269
 It is even more painful when an elbow trekking is gone after I have fallen asleep. 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.300
 It hurt. 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:32.579
 But this... 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.579
 total failure. 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.500
 Now, do you have to sign up on Facebook for a triathlon team? 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.169
 And all my friends will see it. Even into my small movie. 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:54.319
 Do it.
