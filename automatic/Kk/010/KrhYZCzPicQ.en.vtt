 a little bit of everything but good here you can 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.340
 see that practically 80% of the house 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.280
 lounge is all this with a very little lamp 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.980
 shabby a clock that is our a wall 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.950
 with a table with tackle the air 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.520
 conditioned things around the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.380
 light 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.920

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 psychic sea this is the kitchen that is 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 super narrow 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.050
 but good for both of you about the truth 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.329
 the window that faces the street 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 Pretty little cooler of a brand that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 nobody knows more 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:29.480

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.040
 as you can see are the junk we had 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.080

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.300

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.300
 awesome that seville ripped off it seems 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.790
 the sword that carries cloud in the end 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.170
 the 3ds there is a little hidden reuter of 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:08.810
 or does not seem like a 'goat' way here 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.400
 the leisure shelf where we have is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.230
 which it is taped then 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.930
 the bin will have fallen we have a 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.930
 trash and well we're going 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:25.329
 this was from juancar and they are many 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.010
 to see what enters the dangerous area 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.010
 the second prize of the house that is a jewel 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.570
 we also have to ride and things stuck 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.050
 you have here and well all stuck with 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.500
 sticker of that profession to the care of 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.840
 the blue shadow and the room where 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.050
 we sleep we bought a camera eye is 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 so polka dot pretty as is the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.410
 very small address but it has a 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.240
 built-in wardrobe with three doors 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.860
 and here we have the shoemaker that we had 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.210
 at home we have embedded as well as 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.060
 we have been able 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.040
 other photos of us and a TV that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.660
 still not going we have bought a 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.620
 gutter to put it out there underneath it 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.300
 I'm going to teach all this until it arrives 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.870
 someone your faith and the antenna that are there 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.810
 and good and the moment 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.690
 the greatest moment here the the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.150
 flies that on the table 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.950
 to see if it looks but it 's the mascot 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.290
 look the looks are there always 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.010
 flying action of things today obvious that it 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.010
 fight that they fight 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.860
 good where we will have if that and wii 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.010
 because how is my life free today I 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.319
 thrown we would have making videos 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.879
 and nothing that's all it's a small floor 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.280
 compared to the other but I do not know if it is 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.280
 that this house does not have blinds and 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.709
 we have then it's like putting him put a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.829
 old and then we will buy vinyl for 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.569
 the crystals and some shades like that 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.580
 pretty 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.709
 and nothing that's all as you see 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.760
 Do not be small, go to our home 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.930
 but this way we are closer together 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.580
 totally improvised 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.789
 to see what we put in the note of things 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.270
 pretty good 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.970
 Well, that's what I'm going to do, a super zoom 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.280
 because I have to work here, we're going to 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.800
 edit things yes to see if now we go 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.110
 beyond tonight he passes by there to 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.139
 work we do work we have to 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.410

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.400
