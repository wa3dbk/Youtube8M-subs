00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
definitely like a Super Bowl that's I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
definitely like a Super Bowl that's I
think<00:00:52.289> everybody's<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.160> everybody's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.610 
dream in this league you know my dad's
got<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> guess<00:00:57.629> I'd<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> at<00:00:58.559> least

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
got to so I guess I'd like to at least

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
got to so I guess I'd like to at least
hold<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.160> my<00:00:59.309> share<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.640> start<00:01:00.270> pulling<00:01:00.480> one

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
hold up my share and start pulling one

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.179 
hold up my share and start pulling one
in<00:01:00.840> every<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.379> then

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.249 

I<00:01:08.219> think<00:01:08.969> they're<00:01:09.060> gonna<00:01:09.179> be<00:01:09.270> pretty<00:01:09.659> good<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
I think they're gonna be pretty good I

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.450 
I think they're gonna be pretty good I
think<00:01:10.499> it's<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> come<00:01:11.069> down<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
think it's all going to come down to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.399 
think it's all going to come down to
that<00:01:11.490> matchup<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.600> Oklahoma<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.289> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that matchup with Oklahoma there and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
that matchup with Oklahoma there and
early<00:01:13.619> October<00:01:13.770> they're<00:01:14.280> gonna<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.549> real<00:01:14.729> good

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
lot of I mean offensively I just think

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.699 
lot of I mean offensively I just think
everybody<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.690> very<00:02:18.840> comfortable<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
everybody is very comfortable with the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.890 
everybody is very comfortable with the
whole<00:02:20.519> process<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.150> how<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.329> call<00:02:21.599> plays

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
whole process of how we call plays

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.979 
whole process of how we call plays
certain<00:02:22.590> situations<00:02:23.280> red<00:02:24.180> area<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.870> know

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
certain situations red area you know

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.530 
certain situations red area you know
that's<00:02:25.620> where<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:25.980> think<00:02:26.130> was<00:02:26.880> maybe<00:02:27.359> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
that's where I think was maybe the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.849 
that's where I think was maybe the
biggest<00:02:27.720> learning<00:02:28.109> curve<00:02:28.139> I<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.590> we've

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
biggest learning curve I know we've

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.620 
biggest learning curve I know we've
talked<00:02:29.099> about<00:02:29.250> how<00:02:29.669> coach<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:30.150> big<00:02:30.510> on

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
talked about how coach is very big on

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.050 
talked about how coach is very big on
situational<00:02:31.530> football<00:02:31.859> so<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.400> think<00:02:32.940> we're

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
situational football so I think we're

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.150 
situational football so I think we're
all<00:02:33.150> really<00:02:33.359> comfortable<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.109> offense<00:02:34.919> and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
all really comfortable there offense and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.080 
all really comfortable there offense and
defense

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
defense

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
defense
you<00:02:36.690> know<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.930> constantly<00:02:37.440> been<00:02:37.590> hard<00:02:37.799> on

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you know it's constantly been hard on

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.309 
you know it's constantly been hard on
and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.790> got<00:02:39.419> it<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.599> our<00:02:39.720> thick<00:02:39.959> thick

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
and I think we got it in our thick thick

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.620 
and I think we got it in our thick thick
heads<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.739> basically<00:02:41.609> do<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.880> feel<00:02:42.150> okay<00:02:42.569> but

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
heads now basically do you feel okay but

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.760 
heads now basically do you feel okay but
from<00:02:42.900> everything<00:02:43.169> that<00:02:43.319> you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
from everything that you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.800 
from everything that you
to<00:02:44.010> himself<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.670> he<00:02:44.730> setbacks<00:02:45.540> while<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to himself and he setbacks while you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.570 
to himself and he setbacks while you
were<00:02:45.870> out<00:02:45.960> there<00:02:46.080> during<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.440> camp<00:02:46.650> yeah<00:02:47.550> I

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
were out there during the camp yeah I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.110 
were out there during the camp yeah I
really<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> feel<00:02:48.330> great<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.640> trust<00:02:50.640> me<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.820> was

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
really I feel great and trust me I was

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.730 
really I feel great and trust me I was
nervous<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.960> know<00:02:52.080> maybe<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.440> would

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
nervous that you know maybe I would

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.160 
nervous that you know maybe I would
break<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.580> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:54.990> get

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
break down a little bit and you know get

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.100 
break down a little bit and you know get
a<00:02:55.200> sore<00:02:55.470> arm<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.040> uh<00:02:56.210> honestly<00:02:57.210> it's<00:02:57.870> probably

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
a sore arm but uh honestly it's probably

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.010 
a sore arm but uh honestly it's probably
as<00:02:58.380> good<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.620> I've<00:02:58.740> ever<00:02:58.770> felt
