00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.899
 Brakes are very different 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.719
 there must be again above where the customer before 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.469
 The world is very stable brakes 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.480
 There are very light brakes and there are 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.640
 it quite it is very special and there 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 You have to be right though, because you want to be there before 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.740
 now quite extreme light or easy 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.090
 villa robust technology and there is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
 Of course, different manufacturers and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.830
 that is very important that you have the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.529
 The correct world would be constant for most of the time 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 problems come better from athenix 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.469
 example felix installed here galaxy s 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 very good stable brakes have quite 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.570
 extremely sturdy good brake discs the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.559
 has been optimally aligned so has 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.870
 little as often wear and as medium 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 connecting them in the brake fluid came 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 mineral oil and she has a circumferential 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.199
 compensating tank and that is at the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.489
 Brake unique because you can quasi 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.949
 if you stand the wheel upside down 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.559
 get compact air rows and that is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.809
 at our rent and if you have it then 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.670
 Shimano brake is actually counts 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.520
 the most modern brake on the market 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.130
 demarcate as the shimano and the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 used the medium mineral oil or 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.790
 so if you ever times the line price 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.890
 this problem 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.979
 and that has normal horizontal 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.890
 Air equalization tank 90 percent 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.500
 but so easy and is currently 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 she has the most modern braking and has 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.900
 heat became quite so extreme 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.840
 today composite brake discs are the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 in the core of aluminum and just outside with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.549
 stainless steel and are of the cooling effect 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.030
 So is optimum to the ever 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.740
 slow down 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.259
 and there is just the form or 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.689
 slow down what is very much blocked 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.159
 and the formula 1 is so she gave me that 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.110
 Stability but she is the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.009
 The lightest is with the distance 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.770
 lightest brakes 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.320
 she's a racer but that's not the case 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 optimal if someone 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.869
 crossed the Alps with 15 then 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 kilo backpack and of course we come 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.780
 now for example formula 1 is proud 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.979
 in the morning in ever larger brake discs 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.479
 used and know better when 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.099
 Of course , lead the optimal limits 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.420
 in front of type v dc 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.420
 that is optimal
