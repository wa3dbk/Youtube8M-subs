choose<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.420> definitely<00:00:21.840> combine<00:00:22.349> a<00:00:22.380> few

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
choose and so I definitely combine a few

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.990 
choose and so I definitely combine a few
different<00:00:22.800> ideas<00:00:23.099> because<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.730> couldn't

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
different ideas because I couldn't

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.730 
different ideas because I couldn't
narrow<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.509> it's<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:24.929> like<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.470> thing

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
narrow it down it's just like one thing

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
narrow it down it's just like one thing
so<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.310> mean<00:00:26.550> aren't<00:00:26.759> i<00:00:26.910> chose<00:00:27.150> simplicity

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so I mean aren't i chose simplicity

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
so I mean aren't i chose simplicity
because<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.679> thought<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> lighter<00:00:29.519> weight<00:00:29.699> yarn

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
because I thought a lighter weight yarn

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
because I thought a lighter weight yarn
would<00:00:30.240> make<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> better<00:00:30.839> drape<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.560> boxee

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
would make a better drape for boxee

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.880 
would make a better drape for boxee
sweater<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.690> color<00:00:33.900> inspiration<00:00:34.200> came

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
sweater so my color inspiration came

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
sweater so my color inspiration came
from<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.940> artist<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.660> liked

from an artist that I really liked

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.139 
from an artist that I really liked
called<00:00:37.200> Pippin<00:00:37.590> pop<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.190> she<00:00:38.520> creates<00:00:38.940> these

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
called Pippin pop and she creates these

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.260 
called Pippin pop and she creates these
like<00:00:39.450> fantasy<00:00:40.350> scenes<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.610> pastel

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I'm incorporating the ombre effect that

I'm incorporating the ombre effect that
I<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:08.610> inspired<00:02:08.819> by<00:02:09.060> into<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.869> letters<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.619> um

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
I was inspired by into the letters so um

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.000 
I was inspired by into the letters so um
it's<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> like<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> rainbow<00:02:13.319> going

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it's kind of like a rainbow going

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.850 
it's kind of like a rainbow going
through<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.580> letters<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.860> experimented

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
through the letters and I experimented

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.460 
through the letters and I experimented
with<00:02:17.160> how<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> achieve<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.150> ombre<00:02:18.600> effect<00:02:19.020> so

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
with how to achieve this ombre effect so

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.650 
with how to achieve this ombre effect so
first<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.890> tried<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.580> kind<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:21.120> stifling

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
first I tried this kind of like stifling

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.949 
first I tried this kind of like stifling
effects<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:23.040> see<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.730> buy<00:02:24.720> like

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
effects that you can see and buy like

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449 
effects that you can see and buy like
you<00:02:25.110> know<00:02:25.230> switching<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.739> irons<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.340> out

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
you know switching the irons in and out

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.370 
you know switching the irons in and out
to<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.850> faded<00:02:27.180> into<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.450> another<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.989> it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
to like faded into one another but it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020 
to like faded into one another but it
kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> ended<00:02:28.830> up<00:02:28.980> looking<00:02:29.069> more<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.489> feral

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
kind of ended up looking more like feral

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.479 
kind of ended up looking more like feral
than<00:02:30.480> hombre<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.470> which<00:02:32.069> isn't<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> bad<00:02:32.370> thing

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
than hombre so which isn't a bad thing

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.400 
than hombre so which isn't a bad thing
but<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.569> know<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.690> wanted<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.200> read

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
but I just you know I wanted to read

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.890 
but I just you know I wanted to read
more<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.130> gradient<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.000> um<00:02:36.840> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
more like a gradient and so um I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.699 
more like a gradient and so um I
experimented<00:02:37.470> try<00:02:37.950> some<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.160> things<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.910> I

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
experimented try some of things and I

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.220 
experimented try some of things and I
decided<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:41.100> splice<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.090> yarns<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.600> half<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
decided to splice the yarns in half and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.040 
decided to splice the yarns in half and
then<00:02:43.380> knit<00:02:43.920> them<00:02:44.130> together<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:45.090> four<00:02:45.780> rows

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
then knit them together for four rows

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.949 
then knit them together for four rows
and<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:47.430> create<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.940> effect<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.630> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
and so to create that effect and I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.170 
and so to create that effect and I
actually<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:50.070> most<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> back<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.120> my

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
actually have most of the back of my

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.650 
actually have most of the back of my
sweater<00:02:51.540> done<00:02:52.019> as<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.709> see<00:02:53.540> what<00:02:54.540> it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
sweater done as you can see what it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.500 
sweater done as you can see what it
looks<00:02:54.690> like<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> inside<00:02:57.150> lots

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I don't mind doing stuff but Tim sounds

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440 
I don't mind doing stuff but Tim sounds
risky<00:03:10.440> because<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.640> know<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.120> makes<00:03:12.299> it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
risky because you know it just makes it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.940 
risky because you know it just makes it
more<00:03:12.510> fun<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.840> don't<00:03:13.049> want<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.320> blend<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.799> want

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.680 
to do you know something kind of crazy I
also<00:03:15.720> decided<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.670> heart<00:03:18.299> argyle

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
also decided to do a heart argyle

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.539 
also decided to do a heart argyle
pattern<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> front<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.769> my<00:03:19.920> sweater<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
pattern for the front of my sweater I

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.289 
pattern for the front of my sweater I
had<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.329> idea<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:22.170> kind<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.620> an

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
had this idea to do kind of like an

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.750 
had this idea to do kind of like an
argyle<00:03:24.299> inspired<00:03:25.049> pattern<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.250> it's<00:03:26.610> actually

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
argyle inspired pattern so it's actually

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.080 
argyle inspired pattern so it's actually
cables<00:03:27.570> combined<00:03:28.079> with<00:03:28.230> color<00:03:28.440> work<00:03:28.680> to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
cables combined with color work to

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.340 
cables combined with color work to
create<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.329> pattern<00:03:30.750> which<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.320> see

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
create this pattern which you can see

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.220 
create this pattern which you can see
this<00:03:31.890> was<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.519> my<00:03:32.610> swatch<00:03:32.970> yarns<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.600> I'm

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
this was with my swatch yarns and I'm

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.420 
this was with my swatch yarns and I'm
it's<00:03:34.380> really<00:03:34.440> too<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.010> haven't<00:03:35.190> seen

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
