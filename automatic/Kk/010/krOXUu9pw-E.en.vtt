00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.870
 messing around in the garage with the directional 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.630
 tight down is holding onto 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.939
 general gain here stumbles in the garage 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 Our very show 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.930
 I liked it a lot so the procedure is 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.060
 Simple now I'll show you 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 trying to leave the other way leaving 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.130
 on one side but the side of the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.140
 character it will show that that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.890
 message I'll show you here that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.670
 Come, I'll leave it here. 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.960
 I'll leave it here, try to leave, I tried. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
 That's it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.649
 you go there for that desired message 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 Garay, I do not know what you put 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.149
 obviously with tightening ball that does not stop 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.979
 the annoying message does not appear 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.740
 always let down on your 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.500
 character that would be your 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.380
 online character beauty there is bugando 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.190
 mess in the garage over there 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.140
 Unfortunately, I can only give and not 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.670
 able to do in other ways 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.400
 remembering that the update 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.110
 11 of the galley was worth a lot place 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.500
 with the guys and do these jokes 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.959
 Engetec knows gta is fun and personal 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.430
 so it 's like a car that's worth a lot 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.380
 The pity you do is also with the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.520
 quadricycles is because it has 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.680
 minors 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.750
 then it has greater mobility in 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.640
 garage up because you can only give 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.160
 with quadricycles gives you 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 make a total mess there if you're 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.940
 other forms and there is 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.190
 I went past in the comments 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.140
 productive script that they had for sure 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.420
 will be doing with you 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
 Other than that, the guys, I'm not. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.850

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.799

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.549
 It 's hard to squeeze the fuckin 'bag. 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.350

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.600
