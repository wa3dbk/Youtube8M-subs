by my mind's eye and it's a newer

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
by my mind's eye and it's a newer
collection<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> saw<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.050> knew<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
collection and when I saw it I knew it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.940

would be perfect for this album I didn't

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.049 
would be perfect for this album I didn't
want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> traditional<00:00:46.250> baby<00:00:47.250> baby<00:00:47.640> album

want to do a traditional baby baby album

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.139 
want to do a traditional baby baby album
I<00:00:48.210> guess<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.870> still<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.320> girly<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
I guess but it's still very girly I

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.639 
I guess but it's still very girly I
think<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.690> my<00:00:51.809> friends<00:00:52.289> style

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
think this is more of my friends style

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.569 
think this is more of my friends style
which<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.460> thought<00:00:54.180> would<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:54.960> perfect<00:00:55.579> so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
which I thought would just go perfect so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.260 
which I thought would just go perfect so
