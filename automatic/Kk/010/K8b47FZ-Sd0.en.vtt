concert<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.350> end<00:01:34.560> he<00:01:35.130> drew<00:01:35.400> them<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
concert and at the end he drew them a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.800 
concert and at the end he drew them a
picture<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.240> Frieza

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
picture of Frieza

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.609 
picture of Frieza
with<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.680> caption<00:01:38.520> F<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.090> he<00:01:39.570> actually<00:01:39.780> said

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
with the caption F and he actually said

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.760 
with the caption F and he actually said
under<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> allow<00:01:41.970> me<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> my<00:01:43.380> further

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
under it allow me to show you my further

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.840 
under it allow me to show you my further
transformation<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:46.220> have<00:01:47.220> no<00:01:47.460> idea<00:01:47.729> if

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
transformation which I have no idea if

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
transformation which I have no idea if
he<00:01:47.939> actually<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.869> been<00:01:49.079> planning<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.530> giving

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
he actually has been planning on giving

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.039 
he actually has been planning on giving
Frieza<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.250> new<00:01:50.460> transformation<00:01:51.180> ever<00:01:51.450> since

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
Frieza a new transformation ever since

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
Frieza a new transformation ever since
that<00:01:52.110> time<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.670> long

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that time and because that's a very long

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.090 
that time and because that's a very long
time<00:01:54.090> away<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> believe<00:01:55.770> when

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
time away that would be I believe when

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550 
time away that would be I believe when
maybe<00:01:56.640> Valve<00:01:56.850> gods<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.479> announced<00:01:57.869> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
maybe Valve gods was just announced so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
maybe Valve gods was just announced so
it<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.310> probably<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.790> something<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.509> he's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it would probably be something that he's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
it would probably be something that he's
been<00:02:00.780> planning<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.439> while<00:02:01.619> because

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
been planning for a little while because

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
been planning for a little while because
maybe<00:02:02.579> Bob<00:02:02.759> Dobbs<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.329> something<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
maybe Bob Dobbs was just something that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.959 
maybe Bob Dobbs was just something that
he<00:02:04.079> wants<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.460> movie<00:02:05.790> before

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
he wants to put in as a movie before

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.020 
he wants to put in as a movie before
this<00:02:06.719> movie<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.459> guess<00:02:08.610> I'll<00:02:08.759> warm

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this movie like as as I guess I'll warm

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.690 
this movie like as as I guess I'll warm
up<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> DBZ<00:02:10.500> fans<00:02:10.800> who<00:02:11.009> I've<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.520> seen

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
up to for the DBZ fans who I've not seen

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.150 
up to for the DBZ fans who I've not seen
Dragon<00:02:11.970> Ball<00:02:12.120> Z<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.390> actually<00:02:12.660> obvious

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
Dragon Ball Z and actually obvious

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.850 
Dragon Ball Z and actually obvious
like<00:02:13.520> 15<00:02:14.390> years<00:02:14.660> since<00:02:15.140> smart<00:02:15.530> I'm<00:02:15.650> Warren

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
like 15 years since smart I'm Warren

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.350 
like 15 years since smart I'm Warren
actually<00:02:16.340> no<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.610> was<00:02:16.700> been<00:02:16.850> more<00:02:17.000> than<00:02:17.060> 15

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
actually no it was been more than 15

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.880 
actually no it was been more than 15
years<00:02:17.540> since<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.140> actually<00:02:18.260> initially

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
years since it actually initially

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.470 
years since it actually initially
released<00:02:19.130> GT<00:02:19.640> finished<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.270> think

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
released GT finished in like I think

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.770 
released GT finished in like I think
1995<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.460> long<00:02:22.730> time<00:02:23.000> ago<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:23.750> I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
1995 so it was a long time ago so I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.560 
1995 so it was a long time ago so I
guess<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.410> he<00:02:24.500> wanted<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.830> show<00:02:25.010> everyone

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
guess that he wanted to show everyone

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.570 
guess that he wanted to show everyone
some<00:02:26.570> sort<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.840> warm<00:02:27.110> up<00:02:27.260> which<00:02:27.590> was<00:02:27.860> battle

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
some sort of warm up which was battle

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.880 
some sort of warm up which was battle
gods<00:02:28.820> also<00:02:29.150> introducing<00:02:29.780> beerus<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.710> wheat

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
gods also introducing beerus and wheat

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.520 
gods also introducing beerus and wheat
into<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.640> entirety<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.570> Dragon<00:02:33.260> Ball<00:02:33.380> Z

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
into the entirety of Dragon Ball Z

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930 
into the entirety of Dragon Ball Z
universe<00:02:33.860> before<00:02:34.190> he<00:02:34.280> actually<00:02:34.400> puts<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:34.850> in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
universe before he actually puts them in

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.640 
universe before he actually puts them in
this<00:02:35.090> movie<00:02:35.390> cuz<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.840> honestly<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.290> about<00:02:36.410> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
this movie cuz I honestly think about it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.050 
this movie cuz I honestly think about it
if<00:02:36.770> he<00:02:36.860> put<00:02:37.070> beerus<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.490> lys<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.850> movie

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
if he put beerus and lys in the movie

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.430 
if he put beerus and lys in the movie
instantly<00:02:38.480> wouldn't<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.080> fit

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
instantly wouldn't a fit

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.260 
instantly wouldn't a fit
so<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.220> seems<00:02:40.490> like<00:02:40.670> he<00:02:40.790> might<00:02:40.940> actually<00:02:41.120> just

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
so it seems like he might actually just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.060 
so it seems like he might actually just
be<00:02:41.480> giving<00:02:41.780> Frieza<00:02:42.080> an<00:02:42.350> actual<00:02:42.860> new

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
be giving Frieza an actual new

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.100 
be giving Frieza an actual new
transformation<00:02:43.700> when<00:02:44.060> he<00:02:44.150> gets<00:02:44.390> into<00:02:44.990> the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
transformation when he gets into the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.810 
transformation when he gets into the
movie<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> lot<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.070> people<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:46.490> don't<00:02:46.610> know

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
movie now a lot of people we don't know

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.440 
movie now a lot of people we don't know
yet<00:02:47.060> about<00:02:47.240> how<00:02:47.390> Frieza<00:02:48.350> actually<00:02:49.040> becomes<00:02:49.820> so

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
yet about how Frieza actually becomes so

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.200 
yet about how Frieza actually becomes so
powerful<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.010> actual<00:02:52.460> poster<00:02:52.910> itself

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
powerful on the actual poster itself

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.390 
powerful on the actual poster itself
Frieza<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:53.990> his<00:02:54.230> final<00:02:54.770> form<00:02:55.040> he's<00:02:55.160> not<00:02:55.310> in

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
Frieza is in his final form he's not in

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.560 
Frieza is in his final form he's not in
his<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.520> hundred<00:02:55.760> percent<00:02:55.820> form<00:02:56.210> is<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:56.450> in

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
his a hundred percent form is just in

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.010 
his a hundred percent form is just in
his<00:02:56.870> normal<00:02:57.560> final<00:02:57.950> form<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.150> doubt<00:02:59.750> that

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
his normal final form and I I doubt that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.420 
his normal final form and I I doubt that
he's<00:03:00.170> gonna<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.530> staying<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
he's gonna be staying like that the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.980 
he's gonna be staying like that the
entire<00:03:01.550> movie<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> lot<00:03:02.210> of<00:03:02.270> people<00:03:02.450> been<00:03:02.810> saying

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
entire movie a lot of people been saying

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.300 
entire movie a lot of people been saying
oh<00:03:03.080> yeah<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> fusion<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.710> born<00:03:03.920> dude<00:03:04.070> he<00:03:04.160> got

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
oh yeah a fusion of born dude he got

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.130 
oh yeah a fusion of born dude he got
punched<00:03:04.580> by<00:03:04.730> Gohan<00:03:05.030> once<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.450> he<00:03:05.510> died<00:03:05.660> yeah

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
punched by Gohan once and he died yeah

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.290 
punched by Gohan once and he died yeah
but<00:03:06.410> here<00:03:06.680> he<00:03:06.890> actually<00:03:07.040> has<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.580> lot<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.120> power

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
but here he actually has a lot of power

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.140 
but here he actually has a lot of power
that's<00:03:08.540> why<00:03:08.630> he's<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.960> main<00:03:09.140> villain<00:03:09.590> in<00:03:09.680> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
something else that's just amazing about

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.670 
something else that's just amazing about
freeze<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.850> my<00:03:25.970> opinion<00:03:26.360> but<00:03:26.780> yeah<00:03:26.990> I<00:03:27.230> really

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
freeze in my opinion but yeah I really

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.350 
freeze in my opinion but yeah I really
want<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.130> guys<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.280> think<00:03:28.400> about<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:29.060> new

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
want you guys to think about a new

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.670 
want you guys to think about a new
transformation<00:03:29.960> for<00:03:30.110> Frieza<00:03:30.350> what<00:03:30.560> do<00:03:30.620> you

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
transformation for Frieza what do you

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.600 
transformation for Frieza what do you
think<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.890> would<00:03:30.980> look<00:03:31.010> like<00:03:31.190> do<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.490> think

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
think it would look like do you think

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.890 
think it would look like do you think
it's<00:03:31.700> gonna<00:03:31.820> be<00:03:31.970> like<00:03:32.120> coolers

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
it's gonna be like coolers

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.150 
it's gonna be like coolers
transformation<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:33.680> do<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:33.860> think<00:03:33.920> it's

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
transformation or do you think it's

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.790 
transformation or do you think it's
gonna<00:03:34.280> be<00:03:34.520> something<00:03:35.270> along<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.990> lines<00:03:36.200> of<00:03:36.560> a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
gonna be something along the lines of a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.700 
gonna be something along the lines of a
entirely<00:03:37.220> new<00:03:37.580> cyborg<00:03:38.570> like<00:03:38.810> transformation

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
entirely new cyborg like transformation

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.670 
entirely new cyborg like transformation
that<00:03:39.920> looks<00:03:40.130> somewhat<00:03:40.850> mentally<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:41.680> think

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
that looks somewhat mentally I think

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.130 
that looks somewhat mentally I think
that<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.130> could<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:43.700> be<00:03:43.880> something<00:03:44.720> along<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
that it could it be something along the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.900 
that it could it be something along the
lines<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.470> cooler<00:03:45.709> but<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:46.400> have<00:03:46.640> some

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
lines of cooler but it will have some

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.000 
lines of cooler but it will have some
sort<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.209> twist<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.200> makes<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.680> freeze

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
sort of twist on it that makes it freeze

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.040 
sort of twist on it that makes it freeze
his<00:03:49.190> own<00:03:49.430> actual<00:03:50.240> transformation<00:03:50.630> it's<00:03:50.930> not

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
his own actual transformation it's not

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.420 
his own actual transformation it's not
just<00:03:51.200> gonna<00:03:51.290> be<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.709> don't<00:03:51.890> think<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.250> just

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
just gonna be I don't think it's just

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.220 
just gonna be I don't think it's just
gonna<00:03:52.520> be<00:03:52.730> Frieza<00:03:53.420> with<00:03:53.870> coolers

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
gonna be Frieza with coolers

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.140 
gonna be Frieza with coolers
transformation<00:03:54.800> and<00:03:55.010> instead<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.459> coolers

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
transformation and instead of coolers

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.640 
transformation and instead of coolers
color<00:03:56.390> is<00:03:56.510> just<00:03:56.690> gonna<00:03:56.810> be<00:03:56.959> freezes<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.440> think

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
color is just gonna be freezes I think

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.320 
color is just gonna be freezes I think
that<00:03:57.770> there's<00:03:57.950> gonna<00:03:58.040> be<00:03:58.130> something<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.120> little

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
that there's gonna be something a little

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.220 
that there's gonna be something a little
bit<00:03:59.420> more<00:03:59.540> special<00:03:59.900> about<00:04:00.020> this

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
bit more special about this

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.780 
bit more special about this
transformation<00:04:00.830> especially<00:04:01.370> since<00:04:01.550> he's

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
transformation especially since he's

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.699 
transformation especially since he's
having<00:04:02.090> an<00:04:02.300> entire<00:04:02.570> movie<00:04:02.840> based<00:04:03.230> around<00:04:03.530> him

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
having an entire movie based around him

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.920 
having an entire movie based around him
by<00:04:03.860> Toriyama<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:04.700> let's<00:04:05.270> see<00:04:05.450> what<00:04:05.600> we're

don't know any about any transformations

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.910 
don't know any about any transformations

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
think that freeze will actually get a

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.650 
think that freeze will actually get a
huge<00:04:12.830> new<00:04:13.310> transformation<00:04:13.880> that'll<00:04:14.150> look<00:04:14.300> so

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
huge new transformation that'll look so

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.060 
huge new transformation that'll look so
nice<00:04:14.870> or<00:04:15.290> do<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.920> he's<00:04:16.040> just

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
nice or do you think that he's just

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.860 
nice or do you think that he's just
gonna<00:04:16.280> have<00:04:16.489> cooler's<00:04:16.850> transformation<00:04:17.690> I

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
gonna have cooler's transformation I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.240 
gonna have cooler's transformation I
really<00:04:18.170> what<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.440> guys<00:04:18.530> think<00:04:18.680> about<00:04:18.770> this<00:04:19.010> so
