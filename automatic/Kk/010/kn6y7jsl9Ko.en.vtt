today I've got a redstone tutorial for

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.249 
today I've got a redstone tutorial for
you<00:00:10.860> guys<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.570> basically<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.780> simple<00:00:13.139> door

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
you guys I'm basically a simple door

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.810 
you guys I'm basically a simple door
I've<00:00:13.440> known<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> long<00:00:14.519> time

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
I've known how to do for a long time

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
I've known how to do for a long time
well<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.450> not<00:00:15.660> too<00:00:16.500> simple<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.660> I<00:00:18.660> think<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
well it's not too simple but I think you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.300 
well it's not too simple but I think you
could<00:00:19.500> pretty<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:21.470> basically<00:00:22.470> it's

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
could pretty much get it basically it's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.390 
could pretty much get it basically it's
used<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.609> hiding<00:00:23.880> things<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.400> cool

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
used for hiding things it's really cool

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310 
used for hiding things it's really cool
mechanism<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.510> how<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> works<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
mechanism I really like how it works I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.550 
mechanism I really like how it works I
learned<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> friend<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.490> long<00:00:29.640> time<00:00:29.910> ago

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
learned off of a friend a long time ago

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.500 
learned off of a friend a long time ago
and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> course<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.880> put

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and then I here of course I put

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.080 
and then I here of course I put
something<00:00:33.840> together<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> works

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
something together to show how it works

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.310 
something together to show how it works
coming<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.450> course<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> could<00:00:36.930> hide<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
coming up of course you could hide this

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.069 
coming up of course you could hide this
a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.530> bit<00:00:37.710> better<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:39.930> have

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
a little bit better but you would have

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.000 
a little bit better but you would have
no<00:00:40.200> idea<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:41.100> their<00:00:42.770> hide<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
no idea that that's their hide the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.510 
no idea that that's their hide the
switch<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.730> better<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.340> was

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
switch a little bit better but I was

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.619 
switch a little bit better but I was
just<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> quick<00:00:48.090> video<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> show

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
just going to do a quick video to show

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.500 
just going to do a quick video to show
you<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> build<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.190> gonna<00:00:50.250> have

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
you how to build it is you're gonna have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
you how to build it is you're gonna have
I'm<00:00:51.510> pretty<00:00:51.780> sure<00:00:51.930> somebody<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.399> YouTube

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
right up here and take them to time so

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
right up here and take them to time so
it'll<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.850> one<00:01:59.850> two<00:02:02.300> one<00:02:03.300> two<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:06.140> two<00:02:07.789> alright

other side just like that and once
you've<00:02:24.300> got<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.350> start<00:02:25.620> running

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you've got that you can start running

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.490 
you've got that you can start running
wiring<00:02:26.600> like<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:28.489> all<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.970> way<00:02:30.470> over<00:02:31.470> here

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
this one and I like to skip one block I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.860 
this one and I like to skip one block I
guess<00:02:35.100> because<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.640> my<00:02:35.850> wiring<00:02:36.120> look<00:02:36.630> nice

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
guess because I like my wiring look nice

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.810 
guess because I like my wiring look nice
and<00:02:37.110> straight<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.190> I'm<00:02:38.310> pretty<00:02:38.430> sure<00:02:38.550> you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
and straight but I'm pretty sure you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.550 
and straight but I'm pretty sure you
could<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.060> ahead<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.660> stick<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.140> hook<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
could go ahead and stick it and hook it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.229 
could go ahead and stick it and hook it
up<00:02:40.680> against<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> wall<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.760> if

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
up against the wall if you want to if

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.000 
up against the wall if you want to if
you're<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> more<00:02:43.019> compact<00:02:43.620> rights

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
you're going for a more compact rights

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.530 
you're going for a more compact rights
to<00:02:44.190> an<00:02:44.280> environment<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:45.570> um<00:02:47.180> then<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.299> just

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to an environment right um then you just

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.840 
to an environment right um then you just
keep<00:02:48.750> running<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.290> over<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.250> these<00:02:50.430> all

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
keep running it over to all of these all

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.330 
keep running it over to all of these all
the<00:02:51.030> way<00:02:51.090> around<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:55.070> like<00:02:56.070> that

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
the way around just like that

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.270 
the way around just like that
and<00:02:57.819> now<00:02:58.660> if<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.019> notice<00:02:59.290> when<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.040> turn<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and now if you notice when you turn it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.259 
and now if you notice when you turn it
on<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:01.739> will<00:03:02.739> work<00:03:03.010> right<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.550> that's<00:03:04.090> because

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
on it will work right and that's because

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.390 
on it will work right and that's because
you<00:03:05.080> don't<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.379> enough<00:03:05.470> current<00:03:05.890> power<00:03:06.040> so

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
you don't have enough current power so

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.720 
you don't have enough current power so
what<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.120> do<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.420> depending<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.580> where<00:03:09.580> you're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
what I do is depending on where you're

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.160 
what I do is depending on where you're
putting<00:03:09.879> your<00:03:10.060> lever<00:03:10.360> like<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.840> did<00:03:11.050> up<00:03:11.140> there

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
putting your lever like I did up there

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.240 
putting your lever like I did up there
you<00:03:12.129> want<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.459> set<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.680> new<00:03:14.920> redstone

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
you want to set the new redstone

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.369 
you want to set the new redstone
repeaters<00:03:15.760> exactly<00:03:16.660> where<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.049> currents

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
repeaters exactly where the currents

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.330 
repeaters exactly where the currents
going<00:03:18.090> from<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.840> visit<00:03:20.560> transmits<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.160> way

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
going from to visit transmits this way

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.369 
going from to visit transmits this way
in<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.489> camp<00:03:21.730> transmit<00:03:22.299> back<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.310> that

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
in a camp transmit back just like that

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.039 
in a camp transmit back just like that
and<00:03:26.379> now<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.590> look<00:03:27.099> steal<00:03:27.370> my<00:03:27.489> stuff<00:03:27.700> but<00:03:28.049> it'll

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
and now I look steal my stuff but it'll

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.160 
and now I look steal my stuff but it'll
fix<00:03:29.230> itself<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.540> have<00:03:31.630> any<00:03:31.660> troubles

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
fix itself and if you have any troubles

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.809 
fix itself and if you have any troubles
just<00:03:32.470> we<00:03:33.010> watch<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.340> video<00:03:33.610> or<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:36.489> can<00:03:36.640> leave<00:03:36.730> a
