up again
and<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.840> decided<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> raw<00:02:05.180> cuz<00:02:06.180> hydro<00:02:06.630> pumps

and I decided to raw cuz hydro pumps
shaky<00:02:07.560> accuracy<00:02:08.069> comes<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.550> advantage

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
shaky accuracy comes to my advantage

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.809 
shaky accuracy comes to my advantage
that<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.270> roaring<00:02:09.780> away<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.860> comes<00:02:11.130> Alakazam

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
that I roaring away and I comes Alakazam

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.000 
that I roaring away and I comes Alakazam
so<00:02:12.920> I'm<00:02:13.920> thinking<00:02:13.980> focus<00:02:14.760> blast<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.440> decided

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
so I'm thinking focus blast so I decided

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.270 
so I'm thinking focus blast so I decided
to<00:02:17.099> switch<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.580> hells<00:02:17.760> bells<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.980> he<00:02:19.980> does

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280

back<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.769> oh<00:02:40.950> well<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:43.970> he<00:02:44.970> predicted<00:02:45.540> this

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
back to oh well and he predicted this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.539 
back to oh well and he predicted this
and<00:02:46.019> did<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> focus<00:02:46.590> blast<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.190> missed

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
game that he's at miss which is bad for

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.970 
game that he's at miss which is bad for
him<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.099> I'm<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:54.150> complaining<00:02:54.950> Focus<00:02:55.950> Blast

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980

finally<00:02:56.970> hits<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:58.190> wipes<00:02:59.190> my<00:02:59.640> heat<00:03:00.000> trend<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
finally hits and wipes my heat trend is

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.750 
finally hits and wipes my heat trend is
completely<00:03:01.140> away<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> critical<00:03:02.340> hit

completely away with a critical hit

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.170 
completely away with a critical hit
which<00:03:03.950> starts<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.130> make<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.549> for<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.819> missus

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
which starts the make up for the missus

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.979 
which starts the make up for the missus
I<00:03:06.269> guess<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:08.780> switch<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.519> hitmonchan<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:12.150> i

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
I guess so I switch in hitmonchan and i

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.199 
I guess so I switch in hitmonchan and i
went<00:03:13.140> with<00:03:13.260> funder<00:03:13.680> punch<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.730> i<00:03:14.760> really

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
went with funder punch but i really

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.920 
went with funder punch but i really
should<00:03:15.359> have<00:03:15.420> ice<00:03:15.660> punched<00:03:16.320> because<00:03:16.859> i<00:03:17.810> did<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
should have ice punched because i did it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.420 
should have ice punched because i did it
in<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.049> spurt<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.470> thought<00:03:19.769> he<00:03:20.010> might<00:03:20.190> switch

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
in the spurt I thought he might switch

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.710 
in the spurt I thought he might switch
into<00:03:22.010> was<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.220> gold<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.700> but<00:03:24.060> instead<00:03:24.269> he<00:03:24.420> goes

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
into was it gold up but instead he goes

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.460 
into was it gold up but instead he goes
to<00:03:24.989> his<00:03:25.760> clay<00:03:26.760> doll<00:03:26.819> which<00:03:27.450> resists<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
to his clay doll which resists the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.580 
to his clay doll which resists the
Thunder<00:03:28.980> punch<00:03:29.160> well<00:03:29.670> immune<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.630> I

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
Thunder punch well immune to it and I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.140 
Thunder punch well immune to it and I
switch<00:03:31.769> in<00:03:31.889> hells<00:03:32.100> bells<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.639> he<00:03:32.700> sets<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
switch in hells bells and he sets up a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.900 
switch in hells bells and he sets up a
reflect<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.769> used<00:03:37.769> he'll<00:03:38.069> bail<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.549> wake<00:03:38.700> up

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
reflect so I used he'll bail to wake up

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.420 
reflect so I used he'll bail to wake up
mo<00:03:39.090> jumbo<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.780> he<00:03:40.200> spins<00:03:40.500> away<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.980> stealth

wave<00:03:49.470> because<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.769> predicted<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.280> switch<00:03:50.549> but

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
wave because I predicted a switch but

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.020 
wave because I predicted a switch but
although<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.230> cripples<00:03:52.590> his<00:03:52.709> speed<00:03:53.069> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030
