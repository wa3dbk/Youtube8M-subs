00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.210
 greet the lovers of fishing 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.070
 Now I want to show you a video like 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 cook one of the ingredients 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.279
 starter feed and bait for fish 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.310
 It is no secret that cereal com 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.410
 grain mixtures is effective 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.980
 a means for prikarmlivaniya and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.900
 smoothing fisherman instant fishing point 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 angler main components of course 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:38.450
 is corn wheat in principle 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.620
 choirs here but rape is also such 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.160
 good 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 good such components which can 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 activate and improve your bait 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 and in general the desktop at the expense of several 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 moments first 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.820
 good when the bait program 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 consists of cereals 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 different sizes due to the fact that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.399
 times small enough it will force the fish 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.899
 more spinning on prikorm full-time table and 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.420
 choose these small particles mean 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.899
 staying there big increases the chances 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 to bite the fish then due to their 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:23.789
 fraps properties like a little fat 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 fat and he is also attractive to fish and 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.729
 as if stimulates her appetite therefore 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.539
 how could he be so good 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.550
 component that will improve your work 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.470
 prikormki but cook it certainly better 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.479
 separate from corn wheat and other 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:48.630
 cereals to take canola 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.660
 in principle, about 1 and 10 from 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.940
 total mass and cereal that is if as 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.229
 would we take on a daily session us in 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.770
 principle 3-4 kilograms in dry form 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:07.160
 corn and wheat then canola somewhere 300 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.160
 300 grams of dry race is enough 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.640
 throw it is not necessary fermented then 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.069
 how to ferment like corn 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.980
 wheat, too, in principle, it is not such 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.220
 of necessity therefore we prepare it for 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.459
 this separately that we take take took 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.940
 let's say I took 300 grams of dry 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.890
 rapeseed and set it for an hour spent the night 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 water so that small particles surfaced 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.180
 remove them here and a little we boo here 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.100
 here we have a traps machine 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.060
 pot now we just pick it up 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.660
 boiling water and close in such a way that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.660
 he just steamed this time all 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.660
 now call from the kettle 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.000
 everything 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.579
 and now we close it with a lid and leave 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.500
 insist let's see what we have fee 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.590
 Well, dear friends, it took 3 hours 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.219
 our slavery steamed increased in 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.069
 sizes 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:31.090
 water after the water has cooled water i 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:34.000
 merged and we will already pour this 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.120
 traps the capacity that we take it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.319
 at work he is rather crumbly 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.620
 the particles are straight 1 in separately from the other 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.760
 there is 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.629
 suitable for fishing because we 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.200
 conceived in Kosovo poured into 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:58.480
 separate capacity in this capacity i 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:02.799
 I'll take him fishing and there already 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:07.810
 add grain spod mix consisting of 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:14.470
 fermented corn and wheat for 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:17.289
 improve the properties of our bait for 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.830
 create such a good zocor powerful 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:27.010
 what did your fish learn to collect there 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:33.909
 these pieces and stumbled upon our 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:37.979
 the draft we will catch it so 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:44.320
 all the particles are certainly small enough 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:51.870
 such loose pristavuchie here we have 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:53.880
 it is such a substance now 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.630
 in order to boost 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.840
 the attractiveness of our rape can be 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.539
 pour some depp or 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.240
 molasses those who of course have these types 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.580
 how would anyone allow funds 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.509
 which of course pour in and to impart so 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.060
 say aroma and highlighting them in the background 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:21.180
 bait but you can pour or just 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:27.370
 molasses as I can also gives 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:35.979
 great flavor and feeding signal 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:38.550
 for carp fish, fill it up completely to 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.550
 covered 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.250
 like this 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.410
 everything 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:55.710
 Now she will stay with us for several days 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:06:00.940
 on eats well not a few days two days 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:04.270
 stand on feeds won't be perfect 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:09.600
 so beacon additions to our 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.600
 grain companion to all strained forests
