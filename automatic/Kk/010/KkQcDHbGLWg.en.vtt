come and load them ladies it's go time
hey<00:00:11.880> guys<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.570> frozen<00:00:12.900> gaming<00:00:13.500> bringing

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
hey guys this is frozen gaming bringing

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.480 
hey guys this is frozen gaming bringing
my<00:00:14.009> first<00:00:14.719> class<00:00:15.719> setup<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.340> be

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
my first class setup this is going to be

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.900 
my first class setup this is going to be
done<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.150> MSMC<00:00:19.189> think<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.369> playing<00:00:20.699> on

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
done with the MSMC think I'm playing on

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
done with the MSMC think I'm playing on
raid<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.140> anyway<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.039> about

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
raid but anyway it's going to be about

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
raid but anyway it's going to be about
the<00:00:23.369> class<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.910> think<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.019> actually<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the class I think this is actually the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.679 
the class I think this is actually the
best<00:00:25.619> SMG<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.820> that's<00:00:27.000> why<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.210> starting<00:00:27.599> off

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
best SMG so that's why I'm starting off

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.070 
best SMG so that's why I'm starting off
with<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.460> your<00:00:29.730> primary<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.330> it's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
with this one so as your primary as it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650 
with this one so as your primary as it's
the<00:00:31.289> MSMC<00:00:31.890> class<00:00:32.279> setup<00:00:32.759> you're<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the MSMC class setup you're going to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.920 
the MSMC class setup you're going to
have<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.140> MSMC<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.149> attachments<00:00:36.780> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
have the MSMC and the attachments for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
have the MSMC and the attachments for
that<00:00:37.079> goes<00:00:37.440> suppressor<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.090> so

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that goes suppressor and this is just so

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
that goes suppressor and this is just so
you<00:00:39.360> keep<00:00:39.660> off<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> radar<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you keep off the radar and I think it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.510 
you keep off the radar and I think it
might<00:00:42.719> reduce<00:00:43.079> Rico<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:43.980> quote<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
might reduce Rico don't quote me on that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.209 
might reduce Rico don't quote me on that
but<00:00:44.700> I'll<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> check<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.500> seems<00:00:46.980> like

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
but I'll have to check but it seems like

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.060 
but I'll have to check but it seems like
it<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:48.329> grip<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.649> second

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
it and then grip as the second

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520 
it and then grip as the second
attachment<00:00:50.309> which<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.239> again<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> reduce<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
attachment which is again to reduce the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
attachment which is again to reduce the
recoil<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:54.090> over

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
recoil because it's not so good over

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.209 
recoil because it's not so good over
long<00:00:54.480> range<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.590> you're<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
long range if you're going to use this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.770 
long range if you're going to use this
weapon<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.670> need<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.149> stick<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
weapon you need to kind of stick to the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.959 
weapon you need to kind of stick to the
corridors<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> thing

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
corridors and that kind of thing

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.220 
corridors and that kind of thing
otherwise<00:00:59.969> you'll<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.600> screwed<00:01:00.989> when

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
otherwise you'll get really screwed when

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.770 
otherwise you'll get really screwed when
you<00:01:01.320> walk<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.800> open<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:03.180> what

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you walk out in the open as you what

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
you walk out in the open as you what
when<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> watch<00:01:04.260> me<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> game<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.070> see

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
when you watch me on this game you see

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
when you watch me on this game you see
out<00:01:05.369> stick<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.090> certain<00:01:06.510> area<00:01:06.780> where

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
out stick around this certain area where

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.920 
out stick around this certain area where
there's<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.260> too<00:01:07.590> much<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> range<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.700> all

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
there's not too much of a range at all

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
there's not too much of a range at all
so<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> people<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.860> hop<00:01:11.100> up

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
so I get the people when they hop up

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
so I get the people when they hop up
through<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> building<00:01:12.659> through<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> window

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
through the building through the window

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.280 
through the building through the window
so<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.670> couple<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> meters<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so that's like a couple of meters and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
so that's like a couple of meters and
never<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> shoot<00:01:17.130> too<00:01:17.310> far<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.909> stick

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
never have to shoot too far and I stick

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.760 
never have to shoot too far and I stick
to<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> area<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.110> most<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> game

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to that area for out most of the game

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
to that area for out most of the game
until<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.430> end<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> start

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
until the end and that's when I start

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.929 
until the end and that's when I start
doing<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.020> lot<00:01:22.170> worse<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> final

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
doing a lot worse and then the final

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.950 
doing a lot worse and then the final
attachment<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> gun<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:24.990> fast<00:01:25.560> Mac<00:01:25.799> it's

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
attachment on this gun is fast Mac it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.069 
attachment on this gun is fast Mac it's
pretty<00:01:27.960> good<00:01:28.200> fast<00:01:29.040> mag<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> MSMC<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
pretty good fast mag because the MSMC I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.859 
pretty good fast mag because the MSMC I
think<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> most<00:01:32.310> powerful<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.390> think

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
think as it's the most powerful I think

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.740 
think as it's the most powerful I think
again<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:35.009> quote<00:01:35.189> me<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.509> they<00:01:36.509> have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
again don't quote me on that they have

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.260 
again don't quote me on that they have
the<00:01:36.990> lowest<00:01:37.740> ammo<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> SMGs

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the lowest ammo out of all of the SMGs

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
the lowest ammo out of all of the SMGs
so<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> either<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.369> fast

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so it's really good to either have fast

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.319 
so it's really good to either have fast
mag<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.060> extended<00:01:42.600> mag<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:45.149> need

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
mag or extended mag and I think you need

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.690 
mag or extended mag and I think you need
I<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.540> choose<00:01:46.140> fast<00:01:46.409> mag<00:01:46.680> over<00:01:47.040> extended<00:01:47.520> mag

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I I choose fast mag over extended mag

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
I I choose fast mag over extended mag
because<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.479> tend<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.950> kill<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
because I tend to get one kill and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
because I tend to get one kill and
reload<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> lot<00:01:51.930> more<00:01:51.990> convenient<00:01:52.710> for

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
reload so it's a lot more convenient for

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
using this class as I say earlier it's

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.370 
using this class as I say earlier it's
like<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.190> Russian<00:02:56.490> class<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.570> when<00:02:58.230> you're

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
like a Russian class so when you're

like a Russian class so when you're
rushing<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.770> want<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> play<00:02:59.100> really

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
rushing you want to play really

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.630 
rushing you want to play really
aggressively<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.570> just<00:03:01.500> sprint<00:03:01.890> into<00:03:02.520> the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
aggressively so just sprint into the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.820 
aggressively so just sprint into the
thing<00:03:02.880> don't<00:03:03.240> worry<00:03:03.390> about<00:03:03.600> deaths<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.620> it's

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
thing don't worry about deaths so it's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.790 
thing don't worry about deaths so it's
all<00:03:04.980> about<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.870> getting<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.260> hard<00:03:07.440> points

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
all about like getting the hard points

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.080 
all about like getting the hard points
and<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.010> kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.250> thing<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.850> really

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and that kind of thing it's a really

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390 
and that kind of thing it's a really
good<00:03:09.209> class<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:10.080> it's<00:03:10.410> SMG<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.190> you're<00:03:11.370> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
good class because it's SMG so you're a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.910 
good class because it's SMG so you're a
lot<00:03:11.550> faster<00:03:12.000> than<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> assault<00:03:12.480> rifles<00:03:12.959> it's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
lot faster than the assault rifles it's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.460 
lot faster than the assault rifles it's
I<00:03:14.280> think<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.850> best<00:03:15.120> gun<00:03:15.420> war<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.080> my<00:03:16.230> opinion

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
I think the best gun war in my opinion

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.350 
I think the best gun war in my opinion
best<00:03:16.800> got<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> short-range<00:03:17.520> apart<00:03:18.060> from<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
best got a short-range apart from the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.800 
best got a short-range apart from the
kap-40<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> yeah<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.239> cat<00:03:21.420> fault<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
kap-40 so yeah but the cat fault is a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.900 
kap-40 so yeah but the cat fault is a
bit<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.050> newly<00:03:22.230> gun<00:03:22.470> anyway<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:22.890> don't<00:03:23.370> use

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
bit of a newly gun anyway so don't use

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.520 
bit of a newly gun anyway so don't use
that<00:03:23.940> even<00:03:24.720> though<00:03:24.840> my<00:03:24.900> being<00:03:25.140> bitter

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that even though my being bitter

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.699 
that even though my being bitter
hypocrite<00:03:26.269> but<00:03:27.269> yeah<00:03:27.450> try<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.230> stick<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.500> as

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
hypocrite but yeah try and stick to as

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.100 
this kind of gun you never be able to
take<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> sniper<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.660> will<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:36.989> able

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
take on a sniper like you will be able

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.100 
take on a sniper like you will be able
to<00:03:37.320> with<00:03:37.910> some<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.090> other<00:03:39.120> SMGs<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
to with some of the other SMGs like the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.710 
to with some of the other SMGs like the
PDW<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:41.010> tap<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.700> get<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.239> snipers

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
PDW you can tap it and get the snipers

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.030 
PDW you can tap it and get the snipers
and<00:03:42.750> stuff<00:03:43.080> from<00:03:43.200> long<00:03:43.440> range<00:03:43.470> if<00:03:43.920> you're

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
and stuff from long range if you're

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.280 
and stuff from long range if you're
lucky<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.180> has<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:45.690> got<00:03:45.780> too<00:03:46.140> much

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
lucky but this has just got too much

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.650 
lucky but this has just got too much
recoil<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.980> again<00:03:47.940> that's<00:03:48.150> why<00:03:48.390> I've<00:03:48.510> got

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
recoil and again that's why I've got

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.210 
recoil and again that's why I've got
those<00:03:48.840> attachments<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.500> try<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.800> stop<00:03:50.040> as

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
those attachments to try and stop as

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.729 
those attachments to try and stop as
much<00:03:50.400> recall<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> possibly<00:03:51.239> can<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.470> only

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
much recall as I possibly can the only

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.620 
much recall as I possibly can the only
bad<00:03:52.920> thing<00:03:52.980> about<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.550> class<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.090> think<00:03:54.420> is

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
bad thing about this class I think is

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.870 
bad thing about this class I think is
the<00:03:55.110> way<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.709> have<00:03:55.950> no<00:03:56.160> lethal<00:03:56.370> zand<00:03:56.790> no

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
the way I have no lethal zand no

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.600 
the way I have no lethal zand no
tacticals<00:03:57.510> I'm<00:03:58.200> tempted<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.980> take<00:03:59.250> off<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
tacticals I'm tempted to take off the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.449 
tacticals I'm tempted to take off the
perk<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.630> rid<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.810> toughness<00:04:01.400> but<00:04:02.400> I

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
perk to and get rid of toughness but I

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.830 
perk to and get rid of toughness but I
really<00:04:02.850> don't<00:04:03.060> want<00:04:03.239> that<00:04:03.360> extra<00:04:03.660> little

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
really don't want that extra little

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.020 
really don't want that extra little
flinch<00:04:04.170> because<00:04:04.620> as<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.310> said<00:04:05.370> secondly<00:04:05.880> where

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
flinch because as I said secondly where

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.660 
flinch because as I said secondly where
the<00:04:06.120> gun<00:04:06.300> has<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.660> load<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.989> recall<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.769> so

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
the gun has a load of recall as it is so

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.759 
the gun has a load of recall as it is so
if<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.690> deal<00:04:09.900> with<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.110> extra<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.560> little

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
if you can deal with that extra a little

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.280 
if you can deal with that extra a little
bit<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:10.950> recoil<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.840> having<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.930> aim<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.110> little

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
bit of recoil and having to aim a little

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.650 
bit of recoil and having to aim a little
bit<00:04:13.500> lower<00:04:13.709> for<00:04:13.830> example<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.850> if<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.330> get<00:04:15.510> that

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
bit lower for example so if you get that

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.659 
bit lower for example so if you get that
Bitterroot<00:04:16.140> cool<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.979> will<00:04:17.100> just<00:04:17.220> bounced<00:04:17.430> up

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
Bitterroot cool it will just bounced up

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.210 
Bitterroot cool it will just bounced up
and<00:04:17.790> hit<00:04:17.850> me<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> head<00:04:18.330> or<00:04:18.479> something

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
and hit me in the head or something

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.920 
and hit me in the head or something
definitely<00:04:20.220> get<00:04:20.549> rid<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.790> toughness<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.750> have

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
definitely get rid of toughness and have

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.440 
definitely get rid of toughness and have
no<00:04:22.590> perk<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:23.190> greed<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.180> three

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
no perk to greed and just have three

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.830 
no perk to greed and just have three
perks<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.530> scavenger

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
perks so scavenger

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.000 
perks so scavenger

scavenger lightweight and dexterity and
then<00:04:33.010> have<00:04:33.670> for<00:04:34.420> example<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.840> grenade<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.410> a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
then have for example a grenade and a

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.740 
then have for example a grenade and a
