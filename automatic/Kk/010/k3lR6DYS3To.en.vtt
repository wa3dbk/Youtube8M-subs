00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 this 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello good afternoon and welcome to deco 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 Cakes thank you for joining us once 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 more today we are going to make a cake 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.220
 special I know that you like it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.120
 they call and ask us to make cakes of 15 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.490
 so today we bring one of them with a 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.789
 spectacular lily will learn them 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.189
 very easy to do and you know that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.829
 when there are large flowers it is little 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 I work, because they need to do 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.109
 a single one accompanied with some more 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.329
 small and this is very simple to do 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.059
 we're going to be learning in this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.399
 program and especially we are also going to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.909
 make that tape passes is so delicate that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 it is around the cake and in colors 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.039
 very soft an old rose because the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.589
 Most quinceaÃ±eras are chosen 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.559
 still very soft colors very 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.620
 warm and that are super fine for 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.240
 celebrate the 15 we are going to a break 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.240
 We'll be right back 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.340
 Now let's start working with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.359
 this lily for it we have a center 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.929
 which is the stigma that this form has and 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:31.979
 then we have 6 stamens for this what 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:34.469
 let's make us with pasta 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.110
 rubber note that here I have a 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.319
 roll that is thicker at the tip and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 more finite in the bottom part I'm going to 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:46.490
 take one here and I'm going to do some 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.490
 brands 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.700
 there 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.240
 in this way, I'm going to mark it well 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.020
 throughout this of this kind of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.020
 roll 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.179
 that way there with a wire I'm going to 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.530
 moisten it at the tip with a wire 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.340
 number 24 and I'll place it there from 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.950
 down and I'll leave it with one more form 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.430
 or less 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.680
 folded this I'm going to let it dry for a 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 side and I'm going to take more finite wire 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.519
 notice that it is white wire and I here 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.489
 I have class dyed brown what 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.650
 I'm going to place the little tip inside 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:45.459
 to be formed there 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.849
 at the tip a small portion of glace 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.420
 Real also let it dry this go to 6 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:57.420
 they are going to be 6 in quantity then I have 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.609
 here the stigma and here the 6 stamens 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.060
 how are we going to color them, here I have 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.609
 one already dark brown we're going to 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:12.190
 use the dyes of the line 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:15.220
 flavor powder and we will qualify the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.400
 in this way there 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.420
 let's give it the tonality 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.090
 brownish to the side 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.900
 of the wire and to the top where 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.900
 we had placed the glace 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.610
 well, well, some of us are going to 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.790
 we will be more clear and 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.480
 others darker the stigma part 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.230
 we're going to nuance it in the upper part 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.230
 in brown 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.950
 there 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.370
 then we will use the green color 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.790
 lemon 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.600
 This tone is very used to qualify 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.440
 leaves or the bottom part of the flowers 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.680
 let's clarify down that is 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.440
 darker the top part and then in 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.310
 the bottom part let's take the color 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.310
 yellow 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.640
 there the yellow part is the one below 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:30.110
 now yes once we have already nuanced 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:33.770
 we all have the stigma and the six 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.300
 Stamens we are going to join them around 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.300
 to place first three 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.370
 I'll wrap it up there 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.819
 with gummed tape of course like 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.430
 we always use in flowers and 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:54.330
 this mode and then I will place the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.180
 three others 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.180
 that surround this center 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.740
 there 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.930
 well adjusted we can 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.270
 make sure first that everything is 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.780
 well grabbed and then we're going to 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.780
 accommodate 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.560
 around the stigma there 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:25.280
 now let's move on to make the petals 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.010
 we are going to stretch rubber paste those 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.440
 who are encouraged to make the recipe that I give them 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.610
 I taught a little bit and if they do not buy the 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.460
 pasta as it comes made 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.229
 see how to stretch the pasta 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.560
 I'm stretching sideways towards the 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.990
 another and leaving a groove in the middle that 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.370
 get thicker in the middle 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.080
 there I am going to cut with the cutting 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.909
 appropriate 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.150
 delirium there I retire the surplus I raise 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:00.759
 the petal notice that here I have a 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:05.110
 petal marker all this is from the 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:08.680
 line cairo we are going to press on and on 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:13.080
 this way so that all are drawn 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.620
 these specific races of the flower 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.280
 I'm going to mark a furrow in the middle 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:24.180
 delicately so as not to cut the dough there 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.370
 I'm going to fine tune the edges 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.250
 as we always do with the petals 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.340
 so they look delicate soft and 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.740
 real can obey a piece of 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.480
 florist wire 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.840
 number 24 white 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.940
 and I'm going to introduce it in this sector 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.590
 where I left the thickest mass 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.370
 approximately before reaching the 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:56.060
 half because I 'm going to give you the 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:07:00.500
 I want to move with me batt 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.990
 will help support until it is 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.710
 petal to dry I'll make it well 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.770
 stowed there the wadding what it allows is 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.390
 that the petal dries well for the part 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.840
 below and on the top because 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.670
 allows the air to circulate so that it 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.670
 they dry the petals super fast
