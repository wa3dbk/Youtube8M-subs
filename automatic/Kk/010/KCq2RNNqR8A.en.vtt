00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.020 

definitely<00:00:33.260> Beckett<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.039> Lois<00:00:34.610> Lane<00:00:34.670> have

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
jobs Beckett of course I think also kind

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.939 
jobs Beckett of course I think also kind
of<00:00:47.300> blends<00:00:47.539> in<00:00:47.719> with<00:00:47.899> Superman<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.649> in

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
of blends in with Superman and that in

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.049 
of blends in with Superman and that in
my<00:00:49.190> mind<00:00:49.370> she's<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.579> little<00:00:49.850> bit<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:50.000> a

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
my mind she's a little bit of a

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.560 
my mind she's a little bit of a
superhero<00:00:50.479> herself<00:00:51.019> she's<00:00:51.469> trying<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:51.979> fight

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
superhero herself she's trying to fight

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.579 
superhero herself she's trying to fight
to<00:00:53.570> protect<00:00:54.110> victims<00:00:55.070> or<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.879> weak<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.589> you

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
to protect victims or the weak and you

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.889 
to protect victims or the weak and you
know<00:00:57.710> Superman<00:00:58.129> does<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:58.460> constantly<00:00:59.059> Lois

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
know Superman does that constantly Lois

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.139 
know Superman does that constantly Lois
is<00:01:00.049> trying<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.350> get<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.559> story<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.850> she's<00:01:02.030> an

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
is trying to get the story so she's an

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.119 
is trying to get the story so she's an
adventurous<00:01:02.629> spirit

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
adventurous spirit

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.520 
adventurous spirit
I<00:01:04.190> think<00:01:04.670> Beckett's<00:01:05.269> inner<00:01:05.509> world<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.289> lot

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
I think Beckett's inner world is a lot

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.450 
I think Beckett's inner world is a lot
like<00:01:06.740> Lois<00:01:07.009> Lane

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
like Lois Lane

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.540 
like Lois Lane
you<00:01:07.580> know<00:01:08.679> because<00:01:09.679> Beckett's<00:01:10.070> pretty<00:01:10.310> crazy

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
you know because Beckett's pretty crazy

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.590 
you know because Beckett's pretty crazy
for<00:01:10.789> castle<00:01:11.179> to<00:01:11.360> write

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.420 

I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.920> every<00:01:18.689> Lois<00:01:19.689> Lane<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.280> always<00:01:21.280> an

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
I think every Lois Lane is always an

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.609 
I think every Lois Lane is always an
independent<00:01:21.970> kind<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.390> feminine<00:01:23.200> character

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
independent kind of feminine character

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.990 
independent kind of feminine character
and<00:01:26.549> again<00:01:27.549> she's<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.790> modern-day<00:01:28.210> woman<00:01:28.630> cuz

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and again she's a modern-day woman cuz

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.609 
and again she's a modern-day woman cuz
she's<00:01:31.000> an<00:01:31.299> independent<00:01:31.509> working<00:01:31.990> woman<00:01:32.409> but

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
she's an independent working woman but

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.100 
she's an independent working woman but
she's<00:01:32.770> also<00:01:32.950> able<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.700> wear<00:01:33.880> skirts<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:35.049> she

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
she's also able to wear skirts so she

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.210 
she's also able to wear skirts so she
can<00:01:35.380> be<00:01:36.250> sensual<00:01:36.729> she<00:01:37.030> could<00:01:37.180> be<00:01:38.070> sexual<00:01:39.070> but

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
can be sensual she could be sexual but

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.609 
can be sensual she could be sexual but
she<00:01:39.340> can<00:01:39.460> also<00:01:39.580> be<00:01:39.789> spicing<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.659> spunky<00:01:41.409> you

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
she can also be spicing and spunky you

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.760 
she can also be spicing and spunky you
know<00:01:41.740> at<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.130> same<00:01:42.159> time<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.750> think<00:01:44.500> in<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.680> end

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
know at the same time I think in the end

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.139 
know at the same time I think in the end
I<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:45.070> wanted<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.369> bring<00:01:45.549> something<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:46.000> my

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
I just wanted to bring something of my

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.139 
I just wanted to bring something of my
own<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.720> piece<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.520> yeah<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.670> mean<00:01:48.970> that

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
own to the piece so yeah I mean that

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.480 
own to the piece so yeah I mean that
history<00:01:49.569> plays<00:01:49.810> into<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.350> but<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.039> plays<00:01:51.220> into

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
history plays into it but it plays into

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
history plays into it but it plays into
it<00:01:51.520> because<00:01:51.850> that's<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.330> character<00:01:52.990> right

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it because that's the character right

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.130 
it because that's the character right
and<00:01:54.880> then<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.149> just<00:01:55.360> have<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.600> kind<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.810> fill<00:01:56.020> in

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.410 
and then I just have to kind of fill in
the<00:01:56.229> blanks<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.649> between<00:01:56.979> yeah

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.880 

everything<00:02:03.420> has<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.140> communicated

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
everything has to be communicated

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
everything has to be communicated
through<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.460> voice<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.140> commit

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
through your voice and so you commit

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320

more<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:08.009> voice<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.610> might<00:02:08.729> move

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
more in your voice and you might move

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.660 
more in your voice and you might move
your<00:02:09.600> body<00:02:09.810> around<00:02:10.050> differently<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.250> order<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
your body around differently in order to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.820 
your body around differently in order to
get<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.090> right<00:02:12.270> sound<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.930> come<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.620> know

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.530 

so<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> differences<00:02:18.209> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
so that's kind of the differences you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.150 
so that's kind of the differences you
look<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.989> little<00:02:19.140> bit<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.440> jumping<00:02:19.800> monkey

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
look a little bit like a jumping monkey

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.430 
look a little bit like a jumping monkey
I<00:02:20.190> guess<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.360> least<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.840> sure<00:02:22.140> other

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
I guess I do at least I'm sure other

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.800 
I guess I do at least I'm sure other
people<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.209> without<00:02:24.209> moving<00:02:24.480> around

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
people can do it without moving around

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.320 
people can do it without moving around
as<00:02:25.050> much<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.910> maybe<00:02:27.090> people

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
as much as I do but and maybe people

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.090 
as much as I do but and maybe people
move<00:02:27.600> more<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.170> think<00:02:28.319> more<00:02:28.470> camel<00:02:28.800> moves
