00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
an hour cuz like by eight-thirty I put
it<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> recent<00:01:57.299> at<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.899> 920

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
it on but I in the recent at I like 920

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
it on but I in the recent at I like 920
so<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.890> wasn't<00:01:59.189> quite<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.399> full<00:01:59.700> hour<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.509> I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
so it wasn't quite a full hour because I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.649 
so it wasn't quite a full hour because I
was<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.810> dripping<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> running<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.369> on

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
was just dripping and running down me on

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.690 
was just dripping and running down me on
this<00:02:03.229> egg<00:02:03.409> stuff<00:02:03.829> all<00:02:04.009> on<00:02:04.159> me<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> could<00:02:04.520> not

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
this egg stuff all on me I could not

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.190 
this egg stuff all on me I could not
stop<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.030> from<00:02:05.119> dripping<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.780> know<00:02:05.899> had<00:02:06.049> like

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
stop it from dripping you know had like

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.259 
stop it from dripping you know had like
five<00:02:06.469> things<00:02:06.740> over<00:02:06.979> my<00:02:07.009> head<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.789> dylan<00:02:08.090> trip

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
five things over my head it's dylan trip

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.080 
five things over my head it's dylan trip
so<00:02:08.720> i<00:02:09.069> thought<00:02:10.069> i<00:02:10.129> left<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.849> rinse<00:02:10.970> it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
so i thought i left that in and rinse it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.150 
so i thought i left that in and rinse it
out<00:02:11.150> or<00:02:11.299> whatever<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:11.750> hair<00:02:12.019> kind<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.410> felt<00:02:12.680> you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
out or whatever my hair kind of felt you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.339 
out or whatever my hair kind of felt you
know<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.370> expected<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.150> felt<00:02:14.420> strong<00:02:14.989> i

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
know is expected it felt strong i

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.780 
know is expected it felt strong i
wouldn't<00:02:15.680> say<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.010> stripped<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.580> felt

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
wouldn't say it was stripped it felt

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.580 
wouldn't say it was stripped it felt
strong<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.510> kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.720> hard<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:18.260> little<00:02:18.470> bit

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
strong so it's kind of hard a little bit

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.470 
strong so it's kind of hard a little bit
because<00:02:19.010> our<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.400> protein<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:19.940> i<00:02:20.000> needed

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
because our the protein but i needed

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
because our the protein but i needed
that<00:02:20.660> um<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.209> want<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> that's<00:02:24.260> my

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that um and I want to do a that's my

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.440 
that um and I want to do a that's my
intense<00:02:24.830> protein<00:02:25.250> treatment<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.239> want<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
intense protein treatment so I want to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.050 
intense protein treatment so I want to
do<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.959> once<00:02:27.379> or<00:02:27.500> twice<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.769> month<00:02:28.060> or

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
do that like once or twice a month or

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.789 
do that like once or twice a month or
whatever<00:02:29.269> but<00:02:29.599> i'll<00:02:29.720> do<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> light<00:02:30.290> protein

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
whatever but i'll do a light protein

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.800 
whatever but i'll do a light protein
treatment<00:02:31.190> every<00:02:31.400> two<00:02:31.610> weeks<00:02:31.849> which<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.629> just

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
treatment every two weeks which is just

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.530 
treatment every two weeks which is just
using<00:02:33.080> my<00:02:33.349> arm<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:35.060> bail<00:02:35.239> bad

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
using my arm you can bail bad

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.509 
using my arm you can bail bad

that's<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.299> Lightfoot<00:02:38.810> ok<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.250> my<00:02:40.430> camera<00:02:40.700> cut

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
that's a Lightfoot ok so my camera cut

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.850 
that's a Lightfoot ok so my camera cut

i<00:02:54.799> just<00:02:55.040> conditioned<00:02:55.459> my<00:02:55.549> hair<00:02:55.579> because<00:02:55.790> i

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
i just conditioned my hair because i

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.460 
i just conditioned my hair because i
knew<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.450> would<00:02:56.599> get<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.840> tangles<00:02:57.319> and

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
knew that that would get the tangles and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.470 
knew that that would get the tangles and
the<00:02:57.560> nets<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.099> knots<00:02:58.310> out<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:58.910> after<00:02:59.269> i

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the nets and the knots out so after i

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.849 
the nets and the knots out so after i
rinse<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.840> out<00:02:59.900> i<00:03:00.019> lift<00:03:00.379> that<00:03:00.500> on<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:00.739> about

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
rinse that out i lift that on for about

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.300 
rinse that out i lift that on for about
15<00:03:01.370> minutes<00:03:01.579> rinse<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.540> out<00:03:02.859> I'm<00:03:03.859> section<00:03:04.250> my

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
15 minutes rinse that out I'm section my

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.940 
15 minutes rinse that out I'm section my
hair<00:03:04.370> fours<00:03:04.790> soaked<00:03:05.599> most<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.650> water<00:03:06.859> out

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.680 
stuff I've been shared it with a few
people<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:22.970> don't<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.480> much<00:03:23.660> left

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
people so I don't have that much left

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.479 
people so I don't have that much left
and<00:03:24.260> i<00:03:24.319> just<00:03:24.560> recently<00:03:24.739> bought<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.280> would

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
and i just recently bought it would

and i just recently bought it would
almost<00:03:25.669> filled<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:27.560> i<00:03:27.620> really<00:03:28.250> really<00:03:28.459> really

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
almost filled but i really really really
