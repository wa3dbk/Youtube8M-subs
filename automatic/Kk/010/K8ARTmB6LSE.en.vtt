once the light hits them the ingredients

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.100 
once the light hits them the ingredients
start<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.399> disperse<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.120> it<00:00:59.600> just<00:00:59.750> becomes<00:00:59.930> a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
start to disperse and it just becomes a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.700 
start to disperse and it just becomes a
waste<00:01:00.290> of<00:01:00.440> money

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
waste of money

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.889 
waste of money
whereas<00:01:01.219> this<00:01:01.340> packaging<00:01:01.820> is<00:01:01.969> very<00:01:02.390> very<00:01:02.660> good

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
whereas this packaging is very very good

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.109 
whereas this packaging is very very good
the<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:04.280> think<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.640> fact<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.850> they<00:01:04.969> could

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
the I think the fact that they could

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.520 
the I think the fact that they could
have<00:01:05.210> brightening<00:01:05.659> serum<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.110> because<00:01:06.439> that

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
have brightening serum is because that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.810 
have brightening serum is because that
there's<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.770> lot<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:06.979> research<00:01:07.460> has<00:01:07.490> been<00:01:07.670> done

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
there's a lot of research has been done

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.880 
there's a lot of research has been done
on<00:01:07.880> vitamin<00:01:08.270> C<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.450> shows<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.079> can<00:01:09.260> lighten

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
on vitamin C that shows it can lighten

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.170 
on vitamin C that shows it can lighten
skin<00:01:10.220> discolorations<00:01:11.030> like

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
skin discolorations like

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.630 
skin discolorations like
hyperpigmentation<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:12.860> know<00:01:12.979> sun<00:01:13.250> damage

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
hyperpigmentation you know sun damage

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.490 
hyperpigmentation you know sun damage
things<00:01:13.820> like<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.690> there's<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.930> very<00:01:15.200> good

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
things like that so there's a very good

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.770 
things like that so there's a very good
evidence<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.190> product<00:01:16.460> can<00:01:16.780> brighten

in<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.240> pigmentation<00:01:32.720> here<00:01:33.110> I've<00:01:33.680> got<00:01:33.830> a

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
in the pigmentation here I've got a

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.820 
in the pigmentation here I've got a
patch<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.369> here<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.990> Sun<00:01:35.990> damaged<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.560> think

patch of it here and Sun damaged I think

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.100 
patch of it here and Sun damaged I think
and<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.880> definitely<00:01:38.360> definitely<00:01:38.600> made<00:01:39.020> an

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
and it's definitely definitely made an

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.260 
and it's definitely definitely made an
improvement<00:01:39.409> has<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.070> gone<00:01:40.220> absolutely<00:01:41.060> not

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
improvement has it gone absolutely not

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.850 
improvement has it gone absolutely not
but<00:01:41.869> there's<00:01:42.049> definitely<00:01:42.229> an<00:01:42.650> improvement

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
but there's definitely an improvement

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.679 
but there's definitely an improvement
but<00:01:43.549> then<00:01:43.700> again<00:01:43.970> there<00:01:44.150> could<00:01:44.270> be<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.420> million

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
but then again there could be a million

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.359 
but then again there could be a million
reasons<00:01:45.049> why<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.650> that's<00:01:45.799> happen<00:01:46.130> I've<00:01:46.220> been

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
reasons why that that's happen I've been
