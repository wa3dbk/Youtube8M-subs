 You will try to eat 52. - [Curry] That's funny because 

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:39.230
 I am competitive, but I am also 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.110
 I do not want this at all, so I just aspire 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.261
 I get at least 50. 

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.649

 Three, two, one. - [Currie] I'm not happy. 

00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:07.488

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:09.146
 Oh my God, no. 

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.667

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:16.264
 - They gave us only two. 

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:17.703
 So you have to share them. 

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.247

 - Yeah. 

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:30.850
 Sometimes you just want to reproduce. 

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.031
 Are you breathing heavily now? 

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:37.687
