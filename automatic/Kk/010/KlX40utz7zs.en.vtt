face down like this so you're working

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.710 
face down like this so you're working
with<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> flat<00:02:47.549> surface<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:48.390> something

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
with a flat surface or something

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.280 
with a flat surface or something
underneath<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.200> back<00:02:56.060> there<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.080> got

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
underneath the back there so now we got

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.360 
underneath the back there so now we got
a<00:02:58.320> nice<00:02:58.530> flat<00:02:58.860> surface<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.070> start

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
a nice flat surface you can start

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.930 
a nice flat surface you can start
popping<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:04.019> four<00:03:04.350> screws<00:03:04.560> out<00:03:04.940> which

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
popping the these four screws out which

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:35.980 
popping the these four screws out which
are<00:03:06.090> very<00:03:06.299> small<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.970> don't<00:03:09.180> lose<00:03:09.420> them

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.120 
numbers match so after you under your
screws<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.460> can<00:04:28.490> lift<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:29.030> screen<00:04:29.420> out<00:04:29.600> and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
screws you can lift this screen out and

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.390 
screws you can lift this screen out and
then<00:04:31.130> on<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.430> back<00:04:32.200> you're<00:04:33.200> gonna<00:04:33.350> find<00:04:33.740> this

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
then on the back you're gonna find this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.500 
then on the back you're gonna find this
wire<00:04:36.220> taped<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.580> it<00:04:37.790> which<00:04:38.030> you're<00:04:38.240> just<00:04:38.390> gonna

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
wire taped to it which you're just gonna

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.850 
wire taped to it which you're just gonna
gently<00:04:39.020> peel<00:04:39.410> away<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:41.050> then<00:04:42.050> you're<00:04:42.710> gonna

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.180 
gently peel away and then you're gonna
find<00:04:45.280> your<00:04:46.280> 40<00:04:46.700> pin<00:04:47.080> for<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.260> for<00:04:49.010> this

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
find your 40 pin for the for this

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.940 
find your 40 pin for the for this
monitor<00:04:49.610> somewhere<00:04:49.940> 30<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.270> guess<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:53.950> after

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
monitor somewhere 30 I guess so after

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.180 
monitor somewhere 30 I guess so after
you<00:04:55.100> peel<00:04:55.400> this<00:04:55.610> tape<00:04:55.670> off<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:57.740> holds<00:04:58.070> the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
you peel this tape off that holds the

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.910 
you peel this tape off that holds the
connection<00:04:58.730> in<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:02.840> pulls<00:05:03.080> straight<00:05:03.380> out<00:05:03.620> just

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
connection in it pulls straight out just

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.240 
connection in it pulls straight out just
like<00:05:04.700> that

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
like that

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.340 
like that
there's<00:05:07.250> your<00:05:07.430> 40<00:05:07.730> pin<00:05:07.910> connector<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:12.080> as<00:05:12.200> you

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
there's your 40 pin connector so as you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.570 
there's your 40 pin connector so as you
can<00:05:12.500> see<00:05:12.560> this<00:05:13.040> is<00:05:13.190> an<00:05:13.340> m1<00:05:13.670> onw<00:05:14.240> T<00:05:14.540> 2<00:05:14.840> R<00:05:15.620> 3<00:05:16.490> I

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
can see this is an m1 onw T 2 R 3 I

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.350 
can see this is an m1 onw T 2 R 3 I
don't<00:05:16.730> know<00:05:17.090> what<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.610> pertains<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.760> but<00:05:20.180> I

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
don't know what this pertains to but I

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.700 
don't know what this pertains to but I
got<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.660> replacement<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:23.230> was<00:05:24.230> our<00:05:24.410> three

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
got a replacement that was our three

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.350 
got a replacement that was our three
compatible<00:05:25.750> and<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.840> believe<00:05:28.360> that's

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
compatible and I believe that's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.420 
compatible and I believe that's
important

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:52.510 

so<00:05:33.150> let's<00:05:33.810> go<00:05:33.960> ahead<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.290> unwrap<00:05:34.380> it

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.200 

we're<00:05:53.419> gonna<00:05:53.539> plug<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:54.080> 40-pin<00:05:54.650> back<00:05:54.919> in<00:05:58.210> this

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
we're gonna plug the 40-pin back in this

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.320 
we're gonna plug the 40-pin back in this
is<00:05:59.479> very<00:05:59.840> fragile<00:06:00.370> try<00:06:01.370> not<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.729> bend<00:06:01.910> anything

is very fragile try not to bend anything
otherwise<00:06:03.259> it<00:06:03.560> may<00:06:03.770> not<00:06:03.949> work<00:06:04.599> once<00:06:05.599> you<00:06:05.750> get

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
otherwise it may not work once you get

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.050 
otherwise it may not work once you get
it<00:06:06.020> plugged<00:06:06.199> in<00:06:06.500> re<00:06:06.949> stretch<00:06:07.280> your<00:06:07.460> tape<00:06:07.729> just

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
it plugged in re stretch your tape just

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.809 
it plugged in re stretch your tape just
to<00:06:08.300> hold<00:06:09.139> it<00:06:09.289> you<00:06:09.500> may<00:06:09.650> want<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.949> apply<00:06:10.430> new

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
to hold it you may want to apply new

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.300 
to hold it you may want to apply new
tape<00:06:12.490> I'm<00:06:13.490> not<00:06:13.699> going<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.150> and<00:06:15.069> then<00:06:16.069> make<00:06:16.280> sure

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
tape I'm not going to and then make sure

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.670 
tape I'm not going to and then make sure
you<00:06:16.639> fold<00:06:16.940> it<00:06:17.150> it<00:06:17.419> goes<00:06:17.599> back<00:06:17.900> in<00:06:18.139> the<00:06:18.289> same<00:06:18.500> way

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
you fold it it goes back in the same way

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:30.279 
you fold it it goes back in the same way
it<00:06:18.830> came<00:06:19.009> out<00:06:19.069> and<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.970> hole<00:06:29.300> should<00:06:29.750> all<00:06:29.960> line

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
it came out and the hole should all line

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:42.850 
it came out and the hole should all line
up

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.760 

okay<00:06:44.569> so<00:06:45.569> let's<00:06:45.929> start<00:06:46.169> putting<00:06:46.289> the<00:06:46.499> screws

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
okay so let's start putting the screws

00:06:46.770 --> 00:07:08.520 
okay so let's start putting the screws
back<00:06:47.009> in

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.640 

things<00:07:09.280> are<00:07:09.490> so<00:07:09.760> small<00:07:09.820> you<00:07:10.480> need<00:07:11.230> to<00:07:11.350> find<00:07:11.560> a

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
things are so small you need to find a

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:22.110 
things are so small you need to find a
really<00:07:12.160> sharp<00:07:12.700> Philips<00:07:13.570> to<00:07:14.050> do<00:07:14.230> this

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.440 

even<00:07:22.870> the<00:07:22.990> smallest<00:07:23.350> hat<00:07:23.740> if<00:07:23.950> it's<00:07:24.100> not<00:07:24.419> got<00:07:25.419> a

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
even the smallest hat if it's not got a

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.470 
even the smallest hat if it's not got a
sharp<00:07:25.780> tip<00:07:25.990> on<00:07:26.230> it
