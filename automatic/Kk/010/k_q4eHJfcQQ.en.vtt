using them in this tutorial however in
later<00:03:34.629> ones<00:03:34.870> i<00:03:34.989> will<00:03:35.199> be<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:35.590> i'll<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.769> teaching

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
later ones i will be so i'll be teaching

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.830 
later ones i will be so i'll be teaching
you<00:03:36.099> how<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.250> change<00:03:36.400> them<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:37.030> there<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.810> go

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
you how to change them and there you go

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.159 
you how to change them and there you go
we've<00:03:38.440> got<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> calculator<00:03:38.859> with<00:03:39.729> an<00:03:39.849> icon<00:03:40.209> now

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
we've got a calculator with an icon now

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.099 
we've got a calculator with an icon now
we<00:03:41.229> need<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.739> view<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.579> calculator<00:03:43.060> view<00:03:43.419> so

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
we need the view the calculator view so

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.439 
we need the view the calculator view so
to<00:03:44.199> do<00:03:44.379> that<00:03:44.409> all<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.459> need<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.609> do<00:03:45.849> is<00:03:46.060> either

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
to do that all you need to do is either

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.580 
to do that all you need to do is either
drag<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.650> view<00:03:47.949> out<00:03:47.979> onto<00:03:48.669> the<00:03:48.760> screen<00:03:49.000> here<00:03:49.590> we

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
drag a view out onto the screen here we

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.550 
drag a view out onto the screen here we
can<00:03:50.769> either<00:03:50.919> do<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.430> or<00:03:51.790> we<00:03:52.659> can<00:03:52.840> load<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.349> you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
can either do that or we can load of you

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.099 
can either do that or we can load of you
remotely<00:03:54.040> from<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.609> i'm<00:03:55.239> going<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.690> choose<00:03:55.870> the

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
remotely from it i'm going to choose the

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.110 
remotely from it i'm going to choose the
load<00:03:56.440> view<00:03:56.769> remotely<00:03:56.919> option<00:03:57.609> because<00:03:57.970> i

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
load view remotely option because i

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.030 
load view remotely option because i
personally<00:03:58.540> think<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.019> better<00:03:59.229> and<00:03:59.859> what<00:04:00.010> I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
personally think it's better and what I

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.589 
personally think it's better and what I
mean<00:04:00.099> by<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.639> basically<00:04:01.180> we're<00:04:01.389> going<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
mean by that is basically we're going to

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.649 
mean by that is basically we're going to
create<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:02.169> file<00:04:02.620> new<00:04:03.459> file<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.329> we're<00:04:04.540> going

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
create a file new file and we're going

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.300 
create a file new file and we're going

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
calculator view now just so we know it's

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.580 
calculator view now just so we know it's
the<00:04:21.880> calculator<00:04:22.330> view<00:04:22.630> i'm<00:04:23.080> going<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:23.500> be

the calculator view i'm going to be

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.490

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.390 
in their cows
view<00:04:28.900> just<00:04:29.900> for<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.260> sake<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.530> me<00:04:31.190> knowing

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
view just for the sake of me knowing

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.000 
view just for the sake of me knowing
it's<00:04:31.669> calculator<00:04:32.180> view<00:04:32.440> however<00:04:33.440> before<00:04:33.770> we

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
it's calculator view however before we

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.610 
it's calculator view however before we
go<00:04:34.280> on<00:04:34.490> you'll<00:04:35.210> notice<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:35.840> if<00:04:36.200> we<00:04:36.320> go<00:04:36.470> back

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
go on you'll notice that if we go back

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.520 
go on you'll notice that if we go back
to<00:04:36.680> on<00:04:36.889> tab<00:04:37.130> bar<00:04:37.370> we<00:04:38.000> have<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> shrunk<00:04:38.750> view<00:04:39.200> area

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
to on tab bar we have a shrunk view area

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.950 
to on tab bar we have a shrunk view area
here<00:04:40.070> because<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.880> tab<00:04:41.120> bar<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.570> in<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.810> way

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
here because the tab bar is in the way

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.590 
here because the tab bar is in the way
the<00:04:42.710> tab<00:04:42.980> bar<00:04:43.220> takes<00:04:43.580> up<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.880> bit<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.270> screen

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
the tab bar takes up a bit of the screen

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.140 
the tab bar takes up a bit of the screen
so<00:04:45.350> if<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.530> were<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.800> try<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.190> add<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.700> view

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
so if we were to try and add this view

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.020 
so if we were to try and add this view
to<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.900> screen<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.560> will<00:04:48.710> be<00:04:48.889> too<00:04:49.160> big<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.850> will

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
to the screen it will be too big it will

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.510 
to the screen it will be too big it will
still<00:04:50.270> work<00:04:50.300> but<00:04:50.810> half<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.889> of<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.250> will<00:04:52.400> be

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
still work but half of of you will be

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.100 
still work but half of of you will be
missing<00:04:52.760> because<00:04:53.060> there's<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.419> tab<00:04:53.660> bar<00:04:53.900> down

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
missing because there's a tab bar down

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.820 
missing because there's a tab bar down
here<00:04:54.380> now<00:04:55.250> tab<00:04:55.580> bars<00:04:55.880> by<00:04:56.360> default<00:04:56.900> are<00:04:57.139> 49

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
here now tab bars by default are 49

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.340 
here now tab bars by default are 49
pixels<00:04:58.310> so<00:04:59.090> we<00:04:59.270> need<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.600> change<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.020> pixel

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
pixels so we need to change the pixel

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.719 
pixels so we need to change the pixel
size<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:00.889> to<00:05:01.600> 460<00:05:02.600> take<00:05:03.169> away<00:05:03.470> 49<00:05:04.340> which<00:05:04.610> i

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
size of this to 460 take away 49 which i

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.270 
size of this to 460 take away 49 which i
believe<00:05:04.790> is<00:05:05.090> 411<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:06.380> might<00:05:06.860> have<00:05:06.950> got<00:05:07.100> some

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
believe is 411 I might have got some

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.180 
believe is 411 I might have got some
mouth<00:05:07.400> from<00:05:07.610> there<00:05:07.850> or<00:05:08.090> whatever<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:09.200> first<00:05:10.010> of

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
mouth from there or whatever so first of

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.530 
mouth from there or whatever so first of
all<00:05:10.280> we're<00:05:10.639> going<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.910> need<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.120> get<00:05:11.330> rid<00:05:11.479> of

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
all we're going to need to get rid of

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.230 
all we're going to need to get rid of
the<00:05:11.690> status<00:05:12.139> bar<00:05:12.169> because<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.729> tab<00:05:14.000> bar

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
the status bar because the tab bar

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.300 
the status bar because the tab bar
already<00:05:14.479> has<00:05:14.840> one<00:05:15.110> so<00:05:15.740> if<00:05:15.830> we<00:05:15.919> go<00:05:16.070> here<00:05:16.280> to

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
already has one so if we go here to

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.760 
already has one so if we go here to
simulated<00:05:17.210> metrics<00:05:17.720> in<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:17.870> attributes<00:05:18.500> tab

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
simulated metrics in the attributes tab

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.340 
simulated metrics in the attributes tab
go<00:05:19.490> ahead<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:19.820> status<00:05:20.270> bar<00:05:20.479> and<00:05:20.630> select<00:05:20.930> none

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
go ahead to status bar and select none

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.219 
go ahead to status bar and select none
that's<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.400> gone<00:05:22.610> now<00:05:23.270> we<00:05:23.330> can<00:05:23.630> go<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.990> size

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
that's it gone now we can go to the size

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.580 
that's it gone now we can go to the size
tab<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:24.860> we<00:05:25.430> can<00:05:25.610> change<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:26.060> height<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.630> 4<00:05:27.020> 11

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
tab and we can change the height to 4 11

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.129 
tab and we can change the height to 4 11
so<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.310> fits<00:05:28.550> nice<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:28.790> snuggly<00:05:29.419> above<00:05:29.900> our

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
so it fits nice and snuggly above our

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.770 
so it fits nice and snuggly above our
tab<00:05:30.470> bar<00:05:30.910> then<00:05:31.910> I'm<00:05:32.150> just<00:05:32.300> going<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.510> change
