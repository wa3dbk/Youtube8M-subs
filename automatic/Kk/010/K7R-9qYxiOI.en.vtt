00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.960 
could be the ball I think what kind of
strikes<00:04:48.980> me<00:04:49.190> about<00:04:49.310> this<00:04:49.520> game<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.790> that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
strikes me about this game is that

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.750 
strikes me about this game is that
they're<00:04:50.210> going<00:04:50.389> for<00:04:50.690> like<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:51.010> I<00:04:52.010> made<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.490> game

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
they're going for like a I made a game

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.990 
they're going for like a I made a game

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.580 
with zombies in inside view where
they're<00:04:56.150> just<00:04:56.330> gonna<00:04:56.419> like<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.990> gameplay<00:04:57.410> is

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
they're just gonna like the gameplay is

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.740 
they're just gonna like the gameplay is
not<00:04:58.310> fantastic<00:04:58.790> although<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.330> made<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.600> game<00:04:59.720> of

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
not fantastic although I made a game of

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.090 
not fantastic although I made a game of
zombies<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.290> it<00:05:00.350> is<00:05:00.440> pretty<00:05:00.590> good<00:05:00.770> but

zombies and it is pretty good but

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.320 
zombies and it is pretty good but
they're<00:05:01.220> gonna<00:05:01.340> make<00:05:01.610> up<00:05:01.760> for<00:05:01.790> it<00:05:02.090> by<00:05:02.180> having

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
they're gonna make up for it by having
