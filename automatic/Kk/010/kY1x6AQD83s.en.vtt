and I like to leave some room between
each<00:01:46.610> dumpling<00:01:47.200> because<00:01:48.200> they<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.860> tend<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
each dumpling because they can tend to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.420 
each dumpling because they can tend to
stick<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:49.910> another<00:01:50.860> okay<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:51.920> all<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.340> my

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.550 

pretty<00:03:10.880> much<00:03:11.060> all<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.750> water<00:03:12.020> has

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.710 
pretty much all of the water has
evaporated

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.990 

and<00:03:17.720> here<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.170> go<00:03:18.380> seize<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.370> bottom<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000

what<00:03:24.020> we<00:03:24.170> think<00:03:24.410> makes<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.739> taste<00:03:25.010> back

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.910 

and<00:03:28.760> once<00:03:29.060> they<00:03:29.300> get<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.690> crisp<00:03:30.080> you'll<00:03:30.710> know

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
and once they get that crisp you'll know

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.580 
and once they get that crisp you'll know
that<00:03:30.950> they're<00:03:31.310> ready

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.010

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
and now for the best part you know what

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.460 
and now for the best part you know what
I<00:03:45.730> was<00:03:46.330> going<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.600> cut<00:03:46.810> them<00:03:47.020> so<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.290> thought

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
I was going to cut them so I thought

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.990 
I was going to cut them so I thought
that<00:03:47.650> would<00:03:47.740> be<00:03:47.770> better<00:03:47.980> for<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.310> video<00:03:48.550> but

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
that would be better for the video but

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.790 
that would be better for the video but
the<00:03:49.090> way<00:03:49.180> they<00:03:49.330> really<00:03:49.630> should<00:03:49.870> be<00:03:49.960> done<00:03:50.110> is

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
the way they really should be done is

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.820 
the way they really should be done is
all<00:03:51.130> in<00:03:52.060> one<00:03:52.440> site

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830
