the<00:00:20.760> way<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> did<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.619> drilled<00:00:23.609> four

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
the way I did it was I just drilled four

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
the way I did it was I just drilled four
holes<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.460> put<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.580> four<00:00:26.849> screws<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.910> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
holes and put in four screws and you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.429 
holes and put in four screws and you
know<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.150> real<00:00:30.330> sturdy<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> same

wiring done you have your amp where you
want<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> put

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.410 
want it you know you also want to put
your<00:00:52.800> subwoofer<00:00:53.730> where<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
your subwoofer where you want it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.250 
your subwoofer where you want it
typically<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> trunk<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
typically in the trunk like I have it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
typically in the trunk like I have it
then<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.920> try<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
then you know you just try it out and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.340 
then you know you just try it out and
you<00:01:00.899> start<00:01:01.109> adjusting<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:03.140> alright<00:01:04.140> when

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you start adjusting it alright when

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
you start adjusting it alright when
setting<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> amp<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:06.210> you're<00:01:06.360> making

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
setting up the amp when you're making

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
setting up the amp when you're making
all<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> adjustments<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.280> might<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
all the adjustments it's it might be

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
all the adjustments it's it might be
best<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> professional<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
best to have a professional do it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.539 
best to have a professional do it
because<00:01:11.030> some<00:01:12.030> amps<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> lot<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
because some amps have a lot of

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.270 
because some amps have a lot of
different<00:01:14.549> buttons<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> such<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:17.159> be

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
different buttons and such and it can be

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
different buttons and such and it can be
confusing<00:01:18.799> personally<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:21.240> experimented

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
confusing personally I just experimented

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.310 
confusing personally I just experimented
with<00:01:22.200> everything<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.840> set<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
with everything and set it up the way I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
with everything and set it up the way I
wanted<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> by<00:01:25.979> experimenting<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.030> okay

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
wanted it by experimenting with it okay

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.670 
wanted it by experimenting with it okay
so<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.909> four<00:01:30.299> filter<00:01:30.720> filter<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> have

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so and I have four filter filter I have

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
so and I have four filter filter I have
it<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.070> LP

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.670 

and<00:01:36.060> uh<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.830> have<00:01:37.830> been<00:01:38.010> on<00:01:38.160> a<00:01:38.930> channel<00:01:39.930> where<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and uh I have been on a channel where it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.120 
and uh I have been on a channel where it
has<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> two<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.750> could<00:01:42.870> also<00:01:43.070> have<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
has one and two you could also have it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.060 
has one and two you could also have it
bridged<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.800> more

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
bridged and you know that's that's more

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.790 
bridged and you know that's that's more
complicated<00:01:47.730> I<00:01:47.940> won't<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.900> in<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.410> but

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
complicated I won't get in all that but

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.760 
complicated I won't get in all that but
and<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> game<00:01:51.990> that's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and also right here is the game that's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.970 
and also right here is the game that's
pretty<00:01:53.070> much<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:54.180> sets<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.350> amount<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.740> base

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
pretty much what sets the amount of base

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.040 
pretty much what sets the amount of base
you<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.490> uh<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:59.180> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.900> go<00:02:00.990> ahead

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
you get uh so if you want to go ahead

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.780 
you get uh so if you want to go ahead
and<00:02:01.290> experiment<00:02:01.650> with<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.980> yourself<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.610> best

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and experiment with it yourself the best

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
and experiment with it yourself the best
thing<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.330> probably<00:02:03.570> turn<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.260> radio

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
thing to do is probably turn the radio

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.810 
thing to do is probably turn the radio
the<00:02:05.340> head<00:02:05.490> unit<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.560> volume<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.729> be

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
the head unit to the volume that will be

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.570 
the head unit to the volume that will be
maximum<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.510> what<00:02:10.200> you'll<00:02:10.320> have<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.950> then

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
maximum of what you'll have it and then

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.260 
maximum of what you'll have it and then
adjust<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> amplifier<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.880> make<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.060> base

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
adjust the amplifier and make the base

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
adjust the amplifier and make the base
as<00:02:15.600> high<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.260> you'll<00:02:16.500> want<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.860> when<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.580> have

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
as high as you'll want it when you have

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.150 
as high as you'll want it when you have
the<00:02:18.150> head<00:02:18.750> unit<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.170> loud<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.560> want<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the head unit as loud as you want it and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.180 
the head unit as loud as you want it and
if<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.820> starts<00:02:21.180> sounding<00:02:21.360> distorted<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.380> you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
if it starts sounding distorted or you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.800 
if it starts sounding distorted or you
know<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.459> doesn't<00:02:23.940> sound<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.600> just

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
know it doesn't sound right then just

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.170 
know it doesn't sound right then just
turn<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.320> down<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.530> bit<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.760> either<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.150> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
turn it down a bit you can either do it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420 
turn it down a bit you can either do it
like<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> prefer<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
like that or if you prefer to have the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.170 
like that or if you prefer to have the
head<00:02:29.880> unit<00:02:30.200> lower<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.530> vocals<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.130> such<00:02:32.430> then

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
head unit lower the vocals and such then

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
head unit lower the vocals and such then
you<00:02:33.300> can<00:02:33.480> turn<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.720> lower<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:35.130> turn

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
you can turn it lower and then just turn

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.190 
you can turn it lower and then just turn
up<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.459> bass<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.959> amplifier<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:42.200> that's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
up the bass on the amplifier so that's

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.710 
up the bass on the amplifier so that's
it

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.380 

another<00:02:47.720> thing<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.110> could<00:02:48.290> do<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:49.330> install<00:02:50.330> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
another thing you could do is install a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.070 
another thing you could do is install a
switch<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.230> got<00:02:51.440> here<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.750> for

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
switch like I got here and this is for

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.020 
switch like I got here and this is for
the<00:02:54.200> remote<00:02:54.770> wire<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.280> did<00:02:55.550> was<00:02:55.700> cut<00:02:55.910> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the remote wire all I did was cut the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.790 
the remote wire all I did was cut the
remote<00:02:56.300> wire<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.690> put<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.020> each<00:02:57.230> end<00:02:57.530> of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
remote wire and put it on each end of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.610 
remote wire and put it on each end of
the<00:02:58.130> terminals<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.170> it's<00:03:00.170> good<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.440> have

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the terminals for this it's good to have

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.170 
the terminals for this it's good to have
if<00:03:00.950> you're<00:03:01.250> playing<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.670> song<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.030> don't

if you're playing a song you don't
really<00:03:02.300> want<00:03:02.510> bass<00:03:02.750> with<00:03:03.050> like<00:03:03.740> rock<00:03:04.370> songs

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140
