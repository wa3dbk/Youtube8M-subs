personal<00:00:22.859> opinion<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.250> ghosts<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.820> mean<00:00:24.119> it's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
personal opinion on ghosts I mean it's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
personal opinion on ghosts I mean it's
offering<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> typical<00:00:25.740> call<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> duty

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
offering the typical call of duty

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.950 
offering the typical call of duty
experience<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.150> some<00:00:27.480> ways<00:00:27.510> it's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
experience and I think in some ways it's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.290 
experience and I think in some ways it's
a<00:00:28.019> little<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.380> inferior<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.939> previous

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
a little bit inferior to the previous

shooter<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.009> better

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
shooter I think you could do it better

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
shooter I think you could do it better
than<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.579> ghost<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.090> doing<00:01:39.509> currently<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
than what ghost is doing currently but

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
than what ghost is doing currently but
at<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.250> can't<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.670> do

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
at the same time you can't really do

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
at the same time you can't really do
what<00:01:42.210> dot<00:01:42.479> titanfall<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.409> Destin<00:01:43.860> you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
what dot titanfall and Destin you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
what dot titanfall and Destin you're
doing<00:01:44.189> because<00:01:44.509> they<00:01:45.509> are<00:01:45.689> completely

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
doing because they are completely

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.179 
doing because they are completely
different<00:01:46.500> types<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> games<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.159> are

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
different types of games they are

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.620 
different types of games they are
innovating<00:01:47.790> there's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> much

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
innovating there's not really that much

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.560 
innovating there's not really that much
you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.030> first-person

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you can really do with a first-person

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
you can really do with a first-person
shooter<00:01:52.020> set<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> mill<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.399> modern

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
shooter set in the mill in a modern

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
shooter set in the mill in a modern
military<00:01:54.329> setting<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> same

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
military setting but but at the same

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
military setting but but at the same
time<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.880> small<00:01:57.210> things<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.600> they

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
time it's the small things that they

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.969 
time it's the small things that they
could<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.020> doing<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.710> series

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
could be doing to make this series

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.130 
could be doing to make this series
better<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.909> they're<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.210> doing<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.960> old

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
better that they're not doing the old

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
better that they're not doing the old
features<00:02:01.680> each<00:02:02.310> year<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.909> add<00:02:03.030> new<00:02:03.270> features

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
features each year they add new features

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
features each year they add new features
and<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:03.930> over<00:02:04.079> features<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.590> which<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and take over features out which I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
and take over features out which I
understood<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.420> last<00:02:06.600> generation<00:02:06.960> of

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
understood on the last generation of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
understood on the last generation of
consoles<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.060> power<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
consoles but now they have the power to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.900 
consoles but now they have the power to
put<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.050> into<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.500> game

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
put all that into one game

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.970 
put all that into one game

it would knock their entire arm off it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.670 
it would knock their entire arm off it
would<00:02:40.490> be<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.640> lot<00:02:40.850> more<00:02:40.880> gory<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:42.200> why<00:02:42.440> isn't

stuff like that being brought back into
the<00:02:44.390> series<00:02:44.600> now<00:02:44.960> that<00:02:45.230> it's<00:02:45.380> possible<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:46.220> put

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
the series now that it's possible to put

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.360 
the series now that it's possible to put
all<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.420> stuff<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.470> game<00:02:49.340> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
all that stuff in in one game I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.950 
all that stuff in in one game I
understood<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.210> next<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.720> last

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
understood on the next the last

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.110 
understood on the next the last
generation<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.680> wasn't<00:02:52.160> possible<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.760> put<00:02:52.970> all

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
generation it wasn't possible to put all

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.410 
generation it wasn't possible to put all
that<00:02:53.240> stuff<00:02:53.300> in<00:02:53.720> one<00:02:54.620> game<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.490> now<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that stuff in one game but now it is and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.550 
that stuff in one game but now it is and
I<00:02:56.510> think<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.810> they<00:02:56.930> really<00:02:57.110> need<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.380> start

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
I think that they really need to start

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.840 
I think that they really need to start
taking<00:02:57.710> a<00:02:57.920> step<00:02:58.070> forward<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.490> taking<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
taking a step forward and taking the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.030 
taking a step forward and taking the
small<00:02:59.180> things<00:02:59.210> to<00:03:00.200> make<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:00.500> series<00:03:00.740> better

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
small things to make this series better

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.790 
small things to make this series better
and<00:03:01.450> it's<00:03:02.450> especially<00:03:02.960> important<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.650> them

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
and it's especially important for them

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.740 
and it's especially important for them
to<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.130> now<00:03:04.280> since<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.000> have<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.480> many

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
to do it now since you have this many

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.900 
to do it now since you have this many
other<00:03:05.960> games<00:03:06.950> coming<00:03:07.280> out<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.700> could

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
other games coming out that could
