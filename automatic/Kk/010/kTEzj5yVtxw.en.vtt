well it's not 58 it's 57 as you can see
here<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.980> lot<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.040> guys<00:02:23.250> were<00:02:23.520> having<00:02:23.700> problems

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
here a lot of guys were having problems

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.470 
here a lot of guys were having problems
with<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.830> explained<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:27.330> guy

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
with this and I explained it to one guy

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.980 
with this and I explained it to one guy
and<00:02:27.720> he<00:02:27.780> he<00:02:28.110> did<00:02:28.320> make<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> video<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.990> but

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and he he did make a video of it but

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.300 
and he he did make a video of it but
this<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:31.740> more<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:33.570> depth<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:35.250> can

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this is a little more in depth you can

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.020 
this is a little more in depth you can
see<00:02:35.810> what<00:02:36.810> he<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:36.990> talking<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.940> wrote<00:02:38.940> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
see what he was talking about I wrote it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.450 
see what he was talking about I wrote it
before<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> should<00:02:39.990> be<00:02:40.020> 41<00:02:40.650> remember

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
before here but it should be 41 remember

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:51.250 
before here but it should be 41 remember
CB<00:02:42.240> 51<00:02:42.770> should<00:02:43.770> be<00:02:43.920> 41<00:02:44.720> cv<00:02:45.720> 52<00:02:46.550> should<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.730> 57

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.890 

the<00:02:52.260> last<00:02:52.610> CBS<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> will<00:02:54.330> mess<00:02:55.200> with<00:02:55.230> our

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the last CBS that I will mess with our

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.420 
the last CBS that I will mess with our
momentum<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:59.190> I've<00:02:59.970> already<00:03:01.040> programmed<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
momentum and I've already programmed the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.300 
momentum and I've already programmed the
momentum<00:03:02.940> into<00:03:03.390> all<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.080> other<00:03:04.230> SD<00:03:04.710> 60s<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
momentum into all the other SD 60s that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
momentum into all the other SD 60s that
I<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.990> basically<00:03:06.990> what<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.350> use<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:09.140> momentum

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I have basically what I use is momentum

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.320 
I have basically what I use is momentum
for<00:03:10.560> acceleration<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.600> cv3

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.460 

and<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:17.110> put<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.710> value<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.580> 40

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.970 

and<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.060> deceleration<00:03:25.660> or<00:03:26.260> breaking<00:03:26.680> no

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
and for this deceleration or breaking no

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.490 
and for this deceleration or breaking no
momentum<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:29.530> controlled<00:03:30.040> by<00:03:30.420> cv4<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.960> i'll

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
momentum is controlled by cv4 and i'll

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.860 
momentum is controlled by cv4 and i'll
also<00:03:35.710> put<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.190> value<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:36.820> 40<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:41.410> when<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.100> go<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
also put a value of 40 now when I go to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:59.330 
also put a value of 40 now when I go to

that and how to join a contest but for
right<00:05:03.389> now<00:05:03.419> this<00:05:03.599> is<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.020> simple

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
right now this is just simple

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.520 
right now this is just simple
programming<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.729> and<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:07.169> other<00:05:07.199> thing<00:05:07.500> you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
programming it and the other thing you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.700 
programming it and the other thing you
may<00:05:07.800> want<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.280> do<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.789> change<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:10.940> volumes<00:05:11.940> of

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
may want to do is change the volumes of

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.480 
may want to do is change the volumes of
the<00:05:13.710> sound<00:05:15.289> which<00:05:16.289> I'll<00:05:16.560> will<00:05:16.800> do<00:05:16.979> when<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.400> get

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
the sound which I'll will do when I get

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.200 
the sound which I'll will do when I get
to<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.819> but<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:18.750> like<00:05:19.349> a<00:05:19.699> master<00:05:20.699> volume<00:05:20.940> I'll

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
to it but I like a master volume I'll

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.249 
to it but I like a master volume I'll
keep<00:05:21.449> it<00:05:21.599> at<00:05:21.720> 255<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:23.340> air<00:05:23.400> horn<00:05:23.789> volume<00:05:24.300> which

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
keep it at 255 the air horn volume which

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.700 
keep it at 255 the air horn volume which
is<00:05:25.289> CV<00:05:25.770> 129<00:05:26.539> I'll<00:05:27.539> bring<00:05:27.780> I'll<00:05:28.020> keep<00:05:28.319> that<00:05:28.560> as

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
is CV 129 I'll bring I'll keep that as

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.809 
is CV 129 I'll bring I'll keep that as
well<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.190> 255<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:31.169> bell<00:05:31.830> volume<00:05:32.430> I'll<00:05:32.610> bring

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
well to 255 the bell volume I'll bring

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.260 
well to 255 the bell volume I'll bring
it<00:05:32.970> down<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.449> 80<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:35.250> exhaust<00:05:35.729> volume

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
it down to 80 and the exhaust volume

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.300 
it down to 80 and the exhaust volume
I'll<00:05:36.479> bring<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:36.900> down<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.289> 100<00:05:38.099> as<00:05:40.310> normally

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
I'll bring that down to 100 as normally

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.909 
I'll bring that down to 100 as normally
from<00:05:41.490> factory<00:05:42.110> everything<00:05:43.110> is<00:05:43.229> set<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.680> max

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
from factory everything is set to max

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.640 
from factory everything is set to max
and<00:05:44.280> i<00:05:44.849> think<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:46.849> engine<00:05:47.990> sound<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.530> a

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
and i think the the engine sound is a

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.080 
and i think the the engine sound is a
little<00:05:49.860> too<00:05:50.370> loud<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.909> it<00:05:51.889> muffles<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:53.190> air

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
little too loud and it muffles the air

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.459 
little too loud and it muffles the air
horn<00:05:54.479> and<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:55.680> belt<00:05:55.919> which<00:05:56.520> i<00:05:57.120> believe<00:05:58.020> should

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
horn and the belt which i believe should

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.089 
horn and the belt which i believe should
be<00:05:58.500> louder<00:05:58.919> than<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.340> engine<00:06:00.240> sound<00:06:01.099> so

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
be louder than the engine sound so

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.890 
be louder than the engine sound so
that's<00:06:02.370> it<00:06:02.550> for<00:06:03.530> programming<00:06:04.530> these<00:06:04.710> CBS<00:06:05.900> into

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
that's it for programming these CBS into

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.370 
that's it for programming these CBS into
a<00:06:06.930> new<00:06:07.710> install<00:06:08.219> of<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.550> tsunami<00:06:09.139> if<00:06:10.139> you<00:06:10.259> have

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
a new install of a tsunami if you have

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.800 
a new install of a tsunami if you have
any<00:06:10.530> questions<00:06:11.099> just<00:06:11.219> post<00:06:11.789> comments<00:06:12.539> on<00:06:12.630> it
