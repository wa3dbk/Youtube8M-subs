zero<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> hero<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.130> time<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.400> wrote

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
zero to hero was the first time we wrote

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.770 
zero to hero was the first time we wrote
and<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:10.130> love<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> you

and I love that one that that's the you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.030 
and I love that one that that's the you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
know it's close to rock and roll as I've

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
know it's close to rock and roll as I've
gotten<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.030> Disney<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> also

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
gotten here at Disney and it it is also

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.080 
gotten here at Disney and it it is also
the<00:01:19.650> closest<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> probably<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.670> Howard<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the closest to probably what Howard and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
the closest to probably what Howard and
I<00:01:21.180> would<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.479> done<00:01:22.070> zero<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:25.350> hero<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.920> it's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I would have done zero to hero is it's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
I would have done zero to hero is it's
the<00:01:27.090> big<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.350> production

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the big to me it's the big production

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
the big to me it's the big production
number<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> best<00:01:29.640> production<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
number one of the best production that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:43.100 
number one of the best production that
we've<00:01:30.299> been<00:01:30.390> involved<00:01:30.810> with

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.340 

well<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:43.590> animated<00:01:44.460> films<00:01:44.820> are<00:01:45.350> pretty

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
well I think animated films are pretty

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.020 
well I think animated films are pretty
similar<00:01:46.980> to<00:01:47.010> Broadway<00:01:47.430> shows<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.730> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
similar to Broadway shows and I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
similar to Broadway shows and I
certainly<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.840> they're<00:01:49.230> done<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.680> at

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
certainly the way they're done here at

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.310 
certainly the way they're done here at
Disney<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:51.300> want<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> create<00:01:51.990> characters

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
Disney you want to create characters

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
Disney you want to create characters
that<00:01:53.840> sing<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.200> speak<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.490> same<00:01:56.730> voice<00:01:56.940> so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that sing and speak in the same voice so

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.570 
that sing and speak in the same voice so
it's<00:01:57.900> it's<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.560> about<00:01:58.680> historian<00:01:59.400> and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
it's it's very much about historian and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.130 
it's it's very much about historian and
keeping<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> drama<00:02:00.480> going<00:02:00.780> through<00:02:01.050> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
keeping the drama going through the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.820 
keeping the drama going through the
songs<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.190> think<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.730> in<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> way

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
songs so I think that in in that way

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.280 
songs so I think that in in that way
having<00:02:04.830> worked<00:02:05.010> on<00:02:05.130> Broadway<00:02:05.540> was<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> good

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
having worked on Broadway was a good

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.200 
having worked on Broadway was a good
training<00:02:07.650> ground<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:07.980> working<00:02:08.730> on<00:02:08.760> animated

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
training ground for working on animated

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.550 
training ground for working on animated
films<00:02:09.510> they're<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:10.020> quite<00:02:10.590> similar<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.580 

muses<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.860> our<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.240> gospel<00:02:18.810> Greek

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
muses are our kind of gospel Greek

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.220 
muses are our kind of gospel Greek

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
chorus and they have a real sense of

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.230 
chorus and they have a real sense of
humor<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.740> style<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:24.120> the

humor and style and that's what the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.450 
humor and style and that's what the

gospel truth does it sort of sets up how

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:39.670 
gospel truth does it sort of sets up how
we're<00:02:26.730> going<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> tell<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.360> story
