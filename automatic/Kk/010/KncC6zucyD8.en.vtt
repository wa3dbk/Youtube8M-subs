00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.300
 hi people I come back this time 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.920
 with a little video to talk to you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.420
 from their deep cra and again 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 we are entitled to a good overhaul of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 overall quality the role of dept 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.690
 distance from the cra has been strengthened and he has 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.189
 now access to different states for 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.880
 improve this damage so 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.279
 considerable 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.949
 we notice that especially a big 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.670
 modification of the liability precision cra who 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.920
 was before the redesign a duplicate we're going 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.320
 to say of the liabilities of ecaflip not know if 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 you remember but currently on 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.059
 the official server the cra have a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 precision and just like flip cases 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.390
 that is to say that you are going to have a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 certain of everything without luck 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.539
 to have some percentages of damage 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 additional following the member that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.420
 you 're going to touch under tasks and if 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.030
 you touch a job if you touch a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.530
 arm if you touch the brain you 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
 go do bigger damage 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 with this recast accuracy is going 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 now you give blow damage 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.570
 critical for every pm spent for a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 displacement 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.240
 so that reinforces the principle of cra 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 who must stand at a distance and break 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 the currently cra that is a little 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.960
 a fixed turret we'll say remained 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.520
 at the bottom of the map and did not move anymore and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 use all his spells like that his 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 budget now the cra is going to have to get 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.040
 move as often as possible to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.619
 optimize its damage and that couple 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.799
 rather well with sieve given that 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 sift and will reduce resistance to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.189
 critical strokes the elementary branches 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.860
 were each entitled to a new spell 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.900
 with the disappearance of the system of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 tags that we currently have indeed 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.579
 now you will be able to use 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.140
 a neutral tag and often the element 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.509
 of the spell that you will use to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.420
 activate it you're going to be entitled the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.079
 facts from the base of the tag 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.479
 elementary for example if you go 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.899
 make a worse spell on a tag you 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.890
 go activate its push effect 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.210
 now also have pushed thee 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 two boxes and more than one so that's 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.390
 really very interesting 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.620
 suddenly thanks 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
 new location which spells 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.260
 released in each branch I was not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.810
 badly seduced by the new fate earth that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.840
 is more arrows 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 it's a spell without a line of sight and who 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.680
 can do a lot of damage if you 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.080
 use a new liability that is 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.410
 incisor strike incisive strike goes 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.550
 apply the incurable so that can 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.550
 to be nice about monsters that have 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.350
 tend to heal and stabilize it and 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.030
 to apply him biting mordant is in 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.370
 makes a marker that will allow more 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.950
 arrows to inflict double his 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.920
 damage so a pretty burst mechanics 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.660
 classic but the 25 to ticks and then 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 since always had on a big fan of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.590
 the destructive arrow that a pole 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.660
 animation already she's just gorgeous 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.500
 but she still has it 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.330
 do a big burst trick according to the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.170
 level of sifting monstrous then 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.360
 this principle is quite complicated to put 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.130
 in place on monsters that do not have 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.260
 a lot of life or who have little 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.269
 resistance because finally the time 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.700
 as you screen them they will die 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.950
 but instead on monsters rather 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.290
 resistant or on bumps it stays in 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.769
 so really great then he chooses 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.970
 the board 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.620
 r because the storm arrow is a classic 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.470
 very nice for his area and his 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.940
 flexibility 3 p ah it's really nice 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.950
 she did not change too much she just 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.540
 lost her shot in pm and she may have 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.549
 a bonus of damage if you are under 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.860
 elusive elusive and a 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.070
 new passive that activates when you 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.660
 are far from your enemies ie 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.700
 that if around you there is no 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.610
 enemy one less than three boxes from you 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.989
 you will be elusive 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.160
 elusive to be able to apply 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.230
 new effects on some of your 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.660
 elementary spells and coupled to another 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.410
 passive you are going to have also a 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.940
 regeneration 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.770
 so if in your characteristics you 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.100
 have mounted the 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.480
 regeneration according to fo pdv lost if 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.400
 you have elusive beside who 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.560
 live or rijen also there is way to 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.430
 to heal well every time so it's 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 pretty interesting 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.810
 I also climbed in the east branch 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.960
 researcher reflection because it's a 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.270
 fate at very long po and only for 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.890
 doper so has in kind dpa like that to 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.320
 spend EPS totaled 2 percent have 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.730
 always friendly and more 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.080
 the damage has been increased compare to 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.500
 she to flex something that we know 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.510
 currently 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.870
 and she also has a small effect 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.760
 friendly but hey there's no need 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.080
 cast the spell to benefit it's 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.070
 to say that both dishes you 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.140
 able to make an ally transparent and 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.580
 to be able to use all your spells 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.360
 as if they were a hundred bus lines 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.220
 finally 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.500
 and finally the last spell I mounted 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.600
 which of course is burj r6 and the 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.890
 poisoned arrow casts a spell at five 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.500
 dishes that really does damage 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.320
 reasonable but that goes in addition applied 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.230
 a poison on your target so during 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.730
 two rounds she will receive damage 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.310
 slightly below the base of tega 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.800
 come out but it's still a lot of damage 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.760
 friendly so on three rounds 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.920
 finally that you are going to make a 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.190
 hearst group even though it's not in a 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.140
 time 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.970
 it remains interesting this redesign 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.040
 also brings main mechanics 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.190
 for the cra whose gameplay is going 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.440
 really turn around it is especially 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.710
 two particular states which is the state 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.270
 flamboyant and the state lengthens the heels 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.220
 I 'm going to increase target mono damage 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.530
 and the flamboyant state not mount the 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.700
 area damage so according to the spells 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.590
 that you use you will rather 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.520
 mount one or the other is actually it's 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.730
 to say that some elemental spells 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.170
 will you go up a 1/2 c is yours 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.090
 can go up to level 50 so that 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.380
 means 50% mono range targeting more 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.900
 or 53 cents area damage 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.310
 so it's really nice and its stages 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.419
 you have the means to keep them all at 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.380
 throughout the fight so once it 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.060
 reached level 50 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.190
 if you apply to them all the tricks 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.630
 you will keep this state there but you 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.980
 can also make the choice of 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.060
 consume with some come out so 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.450
 especially 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.669
 flattery under the poisoned arrow 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.690
 which goes so if you consume 50 levels 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.020
 of these steps you will reinforce 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.610
 stop the damage of these spells and make 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.690
 a really impressive burst you 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.169
 you have to choose that's what's 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.080
 interesting 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.010
 either you keep your steps for 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.600
 strengthen your damage throughout the 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.280
 fight either you consume them for 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.860
 really do a big burst hole the 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.570
 second mechanical and therefore sharpening to 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.030
 every time you apply 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.130
 flamboyant lengthens riddled or biting 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.919
 you will gain in display and 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.450
 also liabilities that go too 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.120
 applied sharpening and when you 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:33.389
 will reach 102 sharpening you 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.590
 go win the state tip sharpened it's going 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.690
 allow you to increase your 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.360
 next so 40% of the final gains and 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.220
 to recover a point so you go 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.050
 must have really prepared vultures at 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.090
 final ie when you go 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.950
 want to make your spring for example 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.710
 the poisoned arrow or the arrow of that 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.360
 raw street where the rain of arrows with 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.400
 the biting state to double your damage 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.530
 you will have to prepare your tip 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.900
 sharpened to really optimize your 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.330
 damage to the maximum and make a turn of 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.690
 phenomenal burst the tagged retreat has had 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.550
 also a really great change 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:09.570
 this hole makes it now you are not going 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.700
 more destroy your tag for for 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.530
 use your is tagged you go in 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.070
 do and change places with her so 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.410
 it's really cool because if ever 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.970
 monsters do not destroy your 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.470
 tags you can reuse it a 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.539
 another time to do another is 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.700
 tagged activate these different effects I 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.050
 did not talk about the branch wants young 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.220
 even though I did not choose it remains a 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.669
 close interesting but we have to do 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.160
 choices 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.710
 there is particularly the explosive arrow that 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.289
 is of a very interesting with a 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.570
 also a burst mechanics and ben 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:42.300
 actually depend on the number of tags 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.600
 in his area to make a maximum of 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.740
 damages 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.990
 so you can you can for example 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.690
 summoned two tags make your arrows 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.289
 explosive and that's really 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.419
 nice 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.789
 I have a comrade delirium 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:58.800
 showed her on the beta and yeah that's 

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.539
 really nice I went around this 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.139
 that I wanted to talk to you about 

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:03.060
 this redesign 

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:04.090
 so I hope that just like the redesign 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.820
 shop 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.980
 you are rather happy with this one and 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.720
 I invite you to give me my feedback on 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.290
 in the comments to tell me what 

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.060
 what do you think 

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.440
