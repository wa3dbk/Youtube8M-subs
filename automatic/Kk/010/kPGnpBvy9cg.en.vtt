because<00:02:29.270> then<00:02:29.600> will<00:02:29.960> not<00:02:30.110> work<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.530> can<00:02:30.650> only

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
because then will not work you can only

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.860 
because then will not work you can only
open<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.580> update<00:02:31.970> these<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:35.090> right<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.630> then

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
open one update these all right and then

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.300 
open one update these all right and then
you<00:02:35.960> just<00:02:36.230> do<00:02:36.440> anything<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.580> guess<00:02:39.310> now

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you just do anything in it I guess now

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.800 
you just do anything in it I guess now
you<00:02:40.370> can<00:02:40.610> open<00:02:40.820> both<00:02:41.240> chests<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.590> will<00:02:42.770> do

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you can open both chests if I will do

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.280 
you can open both chests if I will do
same<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.140> one<00:02:45.940> like<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.240> one<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.690> two

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
same as this one like this one is two

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.670 
same as this one like this one is two
thousand<00:02:48.680> two<00:02:48.830> thousand<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:51.320> want<00:02:51.530> to
