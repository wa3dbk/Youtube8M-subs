as<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> consultant<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.289> use<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.009> framework

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
as a consultant I use this framework

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.620 
as a consultant I use this framework
I<00:00:23.910> always<00:00:24.210> start<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.810> peak<00:00:25.220> and<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:27.270> reason

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I always start at peak and the reason

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.749 
I always start at peak and the reason
that<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.990> always<00:00:28.140> start<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.770> because<00:00:28.800> as

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
that we always start up it is because as

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.479 
that we always start up it is because as
a<00:00:29.910> consultant<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.840> as<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> person<00:00:32.070> using<00:00:32.400> this

framework to work with other teachers

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.530 
framework to work with other teachers
that's<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.949> people<00:00:35.129> want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> talk<00:00:35.550> about<00:00:35.820> at

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that's what people want to talk about at

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.960 
that's what people want to talk about at
that<00:00:36.570> point<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.199> want<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.530> tell<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
that point I want to tell you about the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.759 
that point I want to tell you about the
worst<00:00:39.180> moment<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.900> about<00:00:40.080> what<00:00:40.350> happened

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
worst moment and about what happened

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.009 
worst moment and about what happened
those<00:00:40.920> worst<00:00:41.190> times<00:00:41.699> in<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.089> suit<00:00:42.330> so<00:00:42.809> that's

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
those worst times in that suit so that's

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.950 
those worst times in that suit so that's
the<00:00:43.230> logical<00:00:43.650> place<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.370> start<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.329> hear<00:00:45.690> some

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the logical place to start to hear some

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.509 
the logical place to start to hear some
of<00:00:45.989> those<00:00:46.140> stories<00:00:46.440> about<00:00:46.739> those<00:00:46.920> incidents

of those stories about those incidents
why<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.269> we<00:00:48.420> spend<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.809> much<00:00:48.930> time<00:00:48.989> planning

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
why don't we spend as much time planning

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.549 
why don't we spend as much time planning
to<00:00:49.890> prevent<00:00:50.339> a<00:00:50.640> crisis<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.440> do

planning for crisis management please
call<00:00:54.780> contact<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:55.890> we'll<00:00:56.010> do

when<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> crisis<00:00:56.789> occurs<00:00:57.030> we'll<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.300> all

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
when the crisis occurs we'll do all

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
when the crisis occurs we'll do all
these<00:00:57.600> steps<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:58.920> some

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
these steps but if we just take some

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
these steps but if we just take some
time<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.399> prevent<00:00:59.670> their<00:00:59.879> crisis<00:01:00.210> from

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
time to prevent their crisis from

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
time to prevent their crisis from
occurring<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> first<00:01:01.410> place<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
occurring in the first place then it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
occurring in the first place then it's
time<00:01:02.219> well<00:01:02.460> spent

this what I call the person on the

this what I call the person on the
street<00:01:37.890> logic<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:38.790> says<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.320> need<00:01:40.740> to

come down on them be harder I need
consequences<00:01:43.440> all<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.680> need<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.190> C<00:01:44.490> word<00:01:44.729> of

consequences all I need the C word of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.139 
consequences all I need the C word of
the<00:01:45.180> behavior<00:01:45.540> lexicon<00:01:46.460> consistently<00:01:47.460> more

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the behavior lexicon consistently more

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.620 
the behavior lexicon consistently more
consistent<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.200> consequences<00:01:49.950> or

consistent with the consequences or
thought<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> good<00:01:52.440> kick<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.070> butt

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.430 
thought or just a good kick in the butt
that's<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> key<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.960> it's

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
that's what that key and then it's

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.260 
that's what that key and then it's
really<00:01:55.590> something<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.100> embedded<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:57.090> us

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
really something that's embedded in us

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.620 
really something that's embedded in us
and<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.280> something<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.580> we<00:01:59.790> default<00:02:00.149> back

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and it is something that we default back

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.850 
and it is something that we default back
to<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.200> some<00:02:01.229> respects<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
to and in some respects and this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:29.550 
to and in some respects and this
pressure<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.340> us<00:02:02.490> too

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.660 

which<00:02:30.560> are<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> students<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.460> would

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
which are the students that we would

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.700 
which are the students that we would
predict<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.300> they<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:32.930> they<00:02:33.110> really<00:02:33.410> go<00:02:33.530> off

school you could tell me who who
probably<00:02:47.780> they<00:02:48.290> might<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:49.340> those<00:02:49.580> sample

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
probably they might be in those sample

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.370 
probably they might be in those sample
kids<00:02:50.210> that<00:02:50.360> if<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.690> happened<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.110> would<00:02:51.230> be
