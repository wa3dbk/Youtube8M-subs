okay we continue back with this issue

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.840 
okay we continue back with this issue
and<00:00:03.540> as<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.470> can<00:00:04.710> see<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.310> already<00:00:05.490> coming

and as you can see we already coming
back<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.420> we<00:00:07.230> use<00:00:07.529> kind<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.300> this<00:00:09.469> Bharucha

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
back and we use kind of this Bharucha

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.270 
back and we use kind of this Bharucha
attention<00:00:11.599> and<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.990> probably<00:00:13.860> will<00:00:14.160> not

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
attention and this probably will not

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.560 
attention and this probably will not
scratch<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> glass

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
scratch on a glass

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.990 
scratch on a glass
you<00:00:15.630> cannot<00:00:15.960> very<00:00:16.710> hardly<00:00:17.160> use<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.609> kind<00:00:17.820> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
you cannot very hardly use this kind of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.519 
you cannot very hardly use this kind of
thing<00:00:18.180> then<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.690> create<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> more<00:00:19.199> scratch

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
thing then you can create a more scratch

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.640 
thing then you can create a more scratch
on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> glass<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.990> to<00:00:21.990> do<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.500> bit

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
on the glass so to do it a little bit

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.000 
on the glass so to do it a little bit
softly<00:00:23.039> right<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.410> apply<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> little

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
softly right and you can apply a little

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.880 
softly right and you can apply a little
bit<00:00:26.160> more<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.789> your<00:00:27.090> Chino<00:00:27.390> water<00:00:27.740> then<00:00:28.740> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
bit more of your Chino water then you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.150 
bit more of your Chino water then you
can<00:00:29.070> see<00:00:29.310> wow<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.260> recurring<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> going

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
can see wow all the recurring is going

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160 
can see wow all the recurring is going
down

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
down

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.310 
down
like<00:00:34.170> why<00:00:34.530> does

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.420 

so<00:00:40.280> after<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.230> probably<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.770> already<00:00:43.160> you

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
so after that probably you already you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.819 
so after that probably you already you
need<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.820> do<00:00:44.000> what<00:00:44.210> do<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.329> need<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.690> do<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.440> use

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
need to do what do you need to do is use

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.150 
need to do what do you need to do is use
a<00:00:45.860> mop<00:00:46.450> and<00:00:47.450> a<00:00:47.480> mix<00:00:47.690> with<00:00:47.840> clean<00:00:48.170> water<00:00:48.470> because

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
a mop and a mix with clean water because

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.940 
a mop and a mix with clean water because
this<00:00:49.910> chemical<00:00:50.300> probably<00:00:50.989> also<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.410> certain

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
this chemical probably also a certain

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.140 
this chemical probably also a certain
glass<00:00:56.650> and<00:00:57.650> then<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.280> have<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.640> image<00:00:58.910> them

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
glass and then you have to image them

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:07.900 
glass and then you have to image them
mop<00:00:59.390> away<00:00:59.720> all<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.590> chemicals<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:07.520> this

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
mop away all the chemicals and this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.200 
mop away all the chemicals and this
again<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:08.420> put<00:01:08.630> some<00:01:08.930> clean<00:01:09.170> water<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:11.150> we

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
again we put some clean water and we

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
again we put some clean water and we
clean<00:01:11.869> once<00:01:12.140> more

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:40.190 

okay<00:01:27.440> hey<00:01:28.440> show<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:31.130> hyoma<00:01:33.260> hey<00:01:34.260> Daniel<00:01:39.200> okay

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
okay hey show me hyoma hey Daniel okay

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.899 
okay hey show me hyoma hey Daniel okay
we<00:01:40.350> still<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.950> finished<00:01:41.369> where<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.940> left

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.929 

so<00:01:49.909> very<00:01:50.570> gently<00:01:51.460> scratch<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.700> surface

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
so very gently scratch the surface

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.960 
so very gently scratch the surface
otherwise<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.070> create<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> scratch<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
otherwise you create a scratch on the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.270 
otherwise you create a scratch on the
glass<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.659> year<00:01:56.869> because<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.439> cannot<00:01:58.100> be

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
glass and this year because it cannot be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.639 
glass and this year because it cannot be
inverted<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.820> anymore

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
inverted it anymore

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:08.050 
inverted it anymore
now<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.710> clean<00:02:01.100> up<00:02:01.130> again

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.780 

and<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.630> show<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.550> see<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and when you show then you can see a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.160 
and when you show then you can see a
clean<00:02:12.180> glass<00:02:12.980> Juna<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.280> simmer<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
clean glass Juna to simmer and then you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.470 
clean glass Juna to simmer and then you
are<00:02:19.500> against<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.459> light<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.850> see<00:02:21.030> some

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
are against the light you can see some

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320 
are against the light you can see some
more<00:02:21.690> laptops<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.550> tool<00:02:23.790> shows<00:02:24.090> how

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
more laptops and if this tool shows how

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.040 
more laptops and if this tool shows how
to<00:02:24.390> remove<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:28.490> if<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:30.090> there's<00:02:30.840> still

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
to remove it if you see there's still

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.080 
to remove it if you see there's still
left<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.620> okay<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.310> put<00:02:32.520> more<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.850> little<00:02:33.060> bit

enough<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:04.019> can<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.310> time

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
enough so can you do this one more time

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.850 
enough so can you do this one more time
just<00:03:05.670> attention<00:03:06.380> let's<00:03:07.380> hide<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.769> here
