to<00:01:37.259> dip<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> I've<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> turn<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to dip down here and I've got to turn it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
to dip down here and I've got to turn it
away<00:01:39.960> right<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.090> new

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
away right now because right in this new

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.060 
away right now because right in this new
version<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> password<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:45.090> actually

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
version with the password it actually

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.560 
version with the password it actually
echoes<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.909> last<00:01:48.329> character<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.409> typed<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
echoes the last character you typed and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
echoes the last character you typed and
so<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.619> potentially<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:54.770> bit<00:01:55.770> good

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so that is potentially a little bit good

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620

app<00:02:14.900> installed<00:02:15.410> that's<00:02:16.010> been<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> little

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
app installed that's been a little

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.330 
app installed that's been a little
quirky<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.330> me<00:02:17.450> today<00:02:17.660> though<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:19.100> as<00:02:19.220> soon

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
quirky for me today though then as soon

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.220 
quirky for me today though then as soon
as<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:19.610> downloaded<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.420> installed<00:02:20.540> in

theory I should be able to launch and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.590 
theory I should be able to launch and
play<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.320> straight<00:02:25.190> away<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.450> that's

play with it straight away and that's

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.450 
play with it straight away and that's

to log in right now i think the point

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.130 
to log in right now i think the point
was<00:03:53.280> well<00:03:53.520> taken<00:03:53.550> oh<00:03:54.060> by<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.480> way<00:03:54.600> here's<00:03:54.900> an

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
was well taken oh by the way here's an

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.710 
was well taken oh by the way here's an
astronomy<00:03:55.950> app<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:56.910> let<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.900> see<00:03:58.230> what

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
astronomy app that will let you see what

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.600 
astronomy app that will let you see what
what<00:04:00.720> constellations<00:04:01.500> are<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.830> sky<00:04:02.070> you

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
what constellations are in the sky you

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.910 
what constellations are in the sky you
just<00:04:02.790> drag<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.270> map<00:04:03.450> around<00:04:03.660> it's<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.620> little

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
just drag the map around it's a little

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.460 
just drag the map around it's a little
laggy<00:04:05.460> it's<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:05.970> little<00:04:06.180> slow<00:04:06.600> slower<00:04:07.200> than<00:04:07.380> I

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
laggy it's a little slow slower than I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.130 
laggy it's a little slow slower than I
would<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.680> expected<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.640> be<00:04:08.810> but<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.960> can

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
would have expected it to be but I can

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.830 
would have expected it to be but I can
easily<00:04:10.500> search<00:04:10.710> for<00:04:11.040> planets<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.580> sky

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
easily search for planets in the sky

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.420 
easily search for planets in the sky
press<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.050> then<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.470> will<00:04:13.590> point<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
press it and then it will point in the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.750 
press it and then it will point in the
direction<00:04:14.580> that<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.510> want<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.960> turn<00:04:16.170> or<00:04:16.500> look<00:04:16.760> so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
direction that I want to turn or look so

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.500 
direction that I want to turn or look so
it's<00:04:18.359> useful<00:04:19.049> it's<00:04:19.850> functional<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.419> they

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
it's useful it's functional but they

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.420 
it's useful it's functional but they
definitely<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.290> optimize<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.860> app<00:04:23.040> for

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
definitely have to optimize this app for

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.450 
definitely have to optimize this app for
speed<00:04:24.140> i'm<00:04:25.140> glad<00:04:25.380> i<00:04:25.560> bought<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.950> because<00:04:26.160> you
