00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
that's really a great thing in my eyes
especially<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:10.760> Sony<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.240> um<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
especially for Sony to do this um I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
especially for Sony to do this um I
really<00:02:14.280> hope<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> comes<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.910> several<00:02:15.300> other

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
really hope it comes to several other

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.540 
really hope it comes to several other
games<00:02:15.780> cuz<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.190> really

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
games cuz I think that would be a really

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.930 
games cuz I think that would be a really
good<00:02:18.080> boost<00:02:19.080> for<00:02:19.440> sales<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.400> profit

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
good boost for sales and just profit

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.310 
good boost for sales and just profit
overall<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> mean<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.290> come<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.890> dead

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
overall I mean so come for is dead

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.090 
overall I mean so come for is dead
resistance<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.650> resistance<00:02:26.550> one<00:02:27.860> these<00:02:28.860> could

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
resistance to resistance one these could

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.120 
resistance to resistance one these could
all<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.670> great<00:02:30.000> things<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.350> know<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:31.830> had

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
all do great things if you know they had

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.160 
all do great things if you know they had
a<00:02:32.160> free<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.550> play<00:02:32.580> option<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.810> could<00:02:33.990> really

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
a free to play option it could really

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.900 
a free to play option it could really
work<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.860> well<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.800> know<00:02:37.950> it's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
work out really well and you know it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.790 
work out really well and you know it's
it's<00:02:39.300> kind<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.780> micro<00:02:40.140> transaction

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
it's kind of like a micro transaction

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.340 
it's kind of like a micro transaction
which<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.459> approve<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.990> this

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
which I don't approve of but this this

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.830 
which I don't approve of but this this
really<00:02:43.620> isn't<00:02:43.950> exactly<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> same<00:02:44.880> because

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
really isn't exactly the same because

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.590 
really isn't exactly the same because
it's<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> demo<00:02:47.160> though<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.240> half

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
it's just like a demo though it is half

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.320 
it's just like a demo though it is half
of<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> game<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:50.640> believe<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.209> get

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
of the game and I believe you can get

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.030 
of the game and I believe you can get
kills<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.870> three<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.350> around<00:02:52.590> twenty<00:02:53.010> five

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
kills on three for around twenty five

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.940 
kills on three for around twenty five
bucks<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.360> even<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:54.959> they<00:02:55.110> don't<00:02:55.410> buy<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.709> off

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
bucks so even if they don't buy it off

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.000 
bucks so even if they don't buy it off
the<00:02:56.989> PlayStation<00:02:57.989> Store<00:02:58.290> they<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.770> at<00:02:58.890> least

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the PlayStation Store they can at least

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.540 
the PlayStation Store they can at least
go<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.580> buy<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> copy<00:03:00.050> um<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:02.130> could<00:03:02.370> be

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
go out and buy a copy um that could be

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.810 
go out and buy a copy um that could be
used<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.780> could<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.709> profit<00:03:05.280> Sony<00:03:05.519> at<00:03:05.700> all

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
used which could not profit Sony at all

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.470 
used which could not profit Sony at all
but<00:03:06.480> I'm<00:03:06.720> sure<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.010> gonna<00:03:08.330> increase<00:03:09.330> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
but I'm sure this is gonna increase the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.880 
but I'm sure this is gonna increase the
community<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.170> kill<00:03:10.320> them<00:03:10.470> through<00:03:10.650> making

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
community and kill them through making

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.500 
community and kill them through making
an<00:03:11.070> overall<00:03:11.580> better<00:03:11.790> experience<00:03:12.360> for

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
an overall better experience for

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.509 
an overall better experience for
everyone<00:03:12.870> who<00:03:13.110> buys<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> game<00:03:13.680> including

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
everyone who buys a game including

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.550 
everyone who buys a game including
myself<00:03:14.670> cuz<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.420> community<00:03:16.290> died<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
myself cuz you know community died a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.479 
myself cuz you know community died a
while<00:03:16.830> back<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> great

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
while back and I think this is a great

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.490 
while back and I think this is a great
move<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.060> hope<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.600> comes<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:22.080> several

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
move and I hope it comes to several

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.650 
move and I hope it comes to several
other<00:03:22.620> games<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.310> um<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.330> this<00:03:24.510> is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
other games you know um I think this is

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.360 
other games you know um I think this is
just<00:03:24.690> gonna<00:03:24.900> be<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.230> first<00:03:25.470> test<00:03:25.800> run<00:03:26.010> about

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
just gonna be the first test run about

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.220 
just gonna be the first test run about
this<00:03:26.580> uh<00:03:27.170> idea<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.620> because<00:03:30.050> well<00:03:31.050> let's
