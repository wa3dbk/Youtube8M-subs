 traffic accidents 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.410
 is one of the most relevant 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.880
 problems of modern medicine 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.550
 The situation is aggravated by the fact that the aid 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 have to render in difficult conditions 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.770
 in our training modules we modeled 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.690
 the situation in which as a result of the accident 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.000
 hurt four people driver 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 turned out to be trapped in his car 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.100
 there are signs of a cervical fracture 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.520
 spinal arterial bleeding a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.620
 also respiratory disorders next 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 injured man with signs 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.539
 fractures of the bones of the right leg and also 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 respiratory disorders also in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.039
 the result of the accident the child suffered 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.420
 he has signs of craniocerebral 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.979
 injuries and respiratory failure 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 the next victim was injured 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.030
 incompatible with life 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.140
 its function in this scenario 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.090
 is to emphasize 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.759
 importance of adhering to principles 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.579
 medical sorting and emphasis 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.470
 focus on k on helping those 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.470
 a patient who can still be helped
