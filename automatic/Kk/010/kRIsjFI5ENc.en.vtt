 hello everyone with you stars and field and this 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.660
 my first audio podcast in which I 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 answer most of the frequently asked 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.590
 questions and so you often ask 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.910
 about new videos of trolling 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.279
 about a lot of trolling i can't do anything 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.500
 promise because I usually take off 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.800
 trolling spontaneously well when there is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.600
 opportunity and suitable situation so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 what about new trolling videos 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.519
 I can not say for sure very 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 many comments with a request to send 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 ip 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.110
 or throw off the client on which we play 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 all trolling removed on the client site 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.410
 t craft room 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.960
 this is my project but while it is frozen and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 server they work near future i 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 I will try to restore it but all this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.039
 depends on being able to promise nothing 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.629
 I can have another very frequent question 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.949
 do I dream no but can not dream 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.379
 a similar question is it possible to play strictly 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.149
 You can usually play up to and arranging 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.270
 games with subscribers creating a huge 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 skype conference so if i 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.210
 Repay Logreus not specifically Skype 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.130
 need to write that bad people and cover 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 just go out with a checkmate if you donâ€™t 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 want to play for that you were 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.250
 added to this skype sometimes ask 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.310
 Why do you need the second channel Mr. Sunset 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.040
 live 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.840
 I don't know for sure yet but the future 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.399
 I will definitely develop it 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.220
 maybe there will be either 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.710
 stream for i will record some 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.659
 blog but most likely stream about 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.520
 VKontakte group yes I understand that there 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.280
 very low activity and I rarely 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.590
 I add posts and follow the group yet 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.079
 I ask you to join this group because 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.030
 that there are very few participants and anything 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.679
 whether there is just anyone to do there 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.619
 people are going I will start to develop this 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.689
 group oh yeah almost forgot i will be very 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.549
 glad your pinart but i think we're showing 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.979
 is like the end since I responded to 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.720
 most questions if she 's not something 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.950

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.600
