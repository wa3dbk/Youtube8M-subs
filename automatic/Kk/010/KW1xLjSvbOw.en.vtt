00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.110
 which there are little tips for 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 make it even better we will do 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.640
 a yogurt cake flavored with 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 with lemon with zest or or so 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 chocolate fruit etc 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.230
 but I'm going to leave it only to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.239
 flour and a bag of baking powder 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.239
 we will start by beating the eggs 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.940
 with sugar by sugars 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 we will beat the mixture until it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 become well sparkling the mixture has 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 slightly increased volume it is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 well sparkling we will now add 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.000
 oil down always beating with 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:33.509
 the mixer then we shave off our 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.079
 yogurt I took a light yogurt but 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:42.920
 you can very well take a yogurt 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.920
 non-lightened whole milk yoghurt 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.100
 then we add the flour in 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.430
 which I added my bag of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.430
 baking powder 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.399
 we finish with the vanilla extract 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.450
 a teaspoon you can in 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.260
 put more if you are really very 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.980
 adjet you can also master - that 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.980
 it is according to your tastes 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.290
 we will now put the dough in the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.870
 mold and bake we bake 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.490
 for about 20 25 minutes at 180 Â° 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.800
 and then we will lower the oven to 150 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.580
 to finish cooking during a 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.190
 twenty minutes 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.560
 so it's gone for about forty 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.709
 oven minutes 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.030
 after 40 to 45 minutes of cooking 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.340
 half to 180 half to 160 the cake is 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.080

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.180
