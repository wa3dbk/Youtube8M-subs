00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.039
 accounting 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.890
 hi i am dmitry fresco for this is my 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.220
 planetary mixer is my culinary 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 a blog 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.219
 each time told the colors with dough 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.530
 like parrots I urge 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.780
 right between him not me for getting 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.030
 this frame but better once 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.010
 see what a hundred times to hear so 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.360
 let's see today what 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 gluten and which one frame 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.549
 the naked eye 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.210
 Here wheat flour will send in bowl 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.899
 mixer a glass of flour and 100 teams like 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.600
 any product 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.070
 well almost any it contains fats 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 carbohydrates and proteins 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.299
 here and protein cars and talk more 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.580
 torment them many different 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.490
 but we are especially interested in the group that 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.740
 cool liver for its special properties 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.229
 called gluten or dishes and what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.580
 translated from Latin means glue 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.740
 the process of forming a long frame 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.539
 May is quite a long time 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.130
 so I will speed up movie playback 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.569
 to which you did not decide what and flies with 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 ingredients interrupt shooting 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.440
 kneading will not 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.179
 british water swells define on 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.280
 retention forms long threads 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.979
 in front that between them it is and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.690
 spatial grid appears 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.509
 concrete frame precisely because of this 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.250
 the dough becomes elastic and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.020
 elastic 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.810
 notice the dough now 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.160
 quite homogeneous but still liquid if 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.190
 would now stop kneading dough 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.869
 depths after this test did not stand 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.239
 gt2 frame in it nimulid dishes it 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.330
 surely swell yes this museum of it 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.310
 content is only something 9 to 12 percent not 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.650
 in individual varieties so called strong 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 flour even on the 13th income idle for 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.739
 matches well in your ear not inside she 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.959
 can develop spatial testik 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.030
 grid for each test you need for 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.890
 given frame for example piecewise it is straight 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.420
 shows you the main thing in it, this 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.599
 brittleness and crumbly with finished 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.920
 cookies but pizza reverse situation 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.000
 that the cake did not work dry and 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280
 tough as plywood 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.230
 rolling out with a rolling pin squeezing out all the gas 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.569
 can't 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.250
 but a developed concrete frame will allow 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.760
 stretch the cake as it does 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.590
 Italian pizza makers and see what 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 going on naturally keep on 15 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.010
 minute changes his 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.730
 viscosity and she's going on a gentle 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.370
 hand in a cluck otlipaet walls now you 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.420
 see that to get a cast frame 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.489
 it's not enough just to mix water and I can 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.670
 and you need to knead the dough yet 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.989
 some time a long time 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.569
 how much does it depend on the content of lutein 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.670
 flour and on the speed of kneading now you 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.650
 at least saw and know that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.879
 such a different dough and what to do 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.879
 to achieve it 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.599
 well that's all for today if you 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.370
 liked put your thumbs up and 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.260
 subscribe to the channel and share 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.670
 a link with friends and I will continue my 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.700
 culinary propaganda in the following 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.700
