side and then I'm going to grate it on

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.990 
side and then I'm going to grate it on
this<00:00:54.480> side<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.079> grater<00:00:55.379> now<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.670> very

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this side of the grater now it's very

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.599 
this side of the grater now it's very
hot<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> stand<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> bit

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
hot so you need to stand back a bit

to<00:01:03.179> do<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:04.230> that's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.589> extreme<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to do this think that's a bit extreme I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.930 
to do this think that's a bit extreme I
said<00:01:06.510> before<00:01:06.690> I'm<00:01:07.080> quite<00:01:07.380> short<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.070> I'm<00:01:08.730> at<00:01:08.910> a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
said before I'm quite short so I'm at a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.030 
said before I'm quite short so I'm at a
disadvantage<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.170> even<00:01:10.440> nearer<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
disadvantage because I'm even nearer to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.770 
disadvantage because I'm even nearer to
it<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:13.140> stand<00:01:13.620> back

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.230 

guess<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.990> good<00:01:18.230> if<00:01:18.350> you've<00:01:18.470> got<00:01:18.620> a<00:01:18.650> cold

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
guess it's good if you've got a cold

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.780 
guess it's good if you've got a cold
it'll<00:01:20.240> clear<00:01:20.570> your<00:01:20.810> sinuses

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
it'll clear your sinuses

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.730 
it'll clear your sinuses

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
this will keep really well once you've

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.490 
this will keep really well once you've
actually<00:01:24.890> made<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:25.600> keep<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.810> sealed<00:01:27.050> in<00:01:27.410> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
actually made it keep it sealed in the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.170 
actually made it keep it sealed in the
fridge<00:01:27.740> it'll<00:01:28.010> keep<00:01:28.220> definitely<00:01:28.700> keep<00:01:28.910> for<00:01:29.120> a

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
fridge it'll keep definitely keep for a
