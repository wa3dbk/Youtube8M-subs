00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.879
 departure with our beloved chess in 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.980
 this time I present you a game on 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.650
 player of the white pieces was gary 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.679
 kasparov and played with travis vinata 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.699
 annan let's see how annan exposes two 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.130
 pieces to two smaller minor pieces 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.980
 specifically a bishop and a horse at 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 attack of a central pawn but that of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.519
 moment can not be captured since 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.149
 there is a tactical theme of attack towards 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.579
 lady but let's see how annan commits 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 an error since he does not realize 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.460
 a movement that Garry Kasparov 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.320
 and prevent prevents it from recovering again 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 the piece we're going to see it quickly what 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 that I have explained and now I am going to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.920
 understand the game is a gambit of 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 lady a Slavic defense the game 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 started with horse f3 of 5 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.460
 c4 c6 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 of 4 horses of 6 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 C3 horse and 6-4 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 to 4 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.640
 bishop f5 of anna the 36 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:24.040
 bishop by c 4 kasparov bishop capture 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 the pawn of c4 and bishop of 4 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.890
 leaving the horse nailed to the king 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.250
 Casting short of Kasparov 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.120
 annan does the same with his castling to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.290
 protect the two have protected their king 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.680
 lady of 2 and horse sees of 7 of bisbee 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:50.260
 will try to horse 5 makes gary 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 kasparov and live will make tower and 8 see 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.060
 as the tower indirectly despite 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.840
 that there are a lot of pieces in between 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.150
 is attacking by ray x to the lady and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.400
 this is what the subject will allow 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.950
 tactical that told you about attack as 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.099
 towards two pieces 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.869
 minors now we are going to see it and as not 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.590
 you can capture neither of the two 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.480
 precisely because of this play that has 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.810
 done now Viswanathan Anand who has 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.459
 confronted his tower towards the lady and by 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.330
 lightning here even though there is now 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.489
 many pieces in between gives rise to this 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.150
 combination that at the moment can not be 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.340
 do one tower does the same kaspar 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.049
 with the lady of miss vinatera na but 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.810
 Anna takes it off and takes her to Lady C7 now 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:45.870
 Garry Kasparov captures the horse 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.870
 anal and lady by 7 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.040
 again the lady also of to live 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.180
 tied in is in front of the tower here and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.810
 gary kasparov cf3 and will live is nothing what 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.080
 I tell you, take the horse 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.830
 of 5 and that's where the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.600
 combination of the pawn attack now 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:17.150
 after the pawn 4 first gaspar or 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.280
 threatens the bishop knight to 2 and bishop f8 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.970
 of bisbee will kill the now so 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.930
 we see that gary kasparov makes 4 and attacks 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.080
 the two pieces but it's not a problem 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.520
 because the piece is recovered here 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:40.180
 bismillah tara nothing he does bishop 6 and 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.550
 let this horse be captured because 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.160
 let this horse be captured in 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.239
 principle gary kasparov does not capture it 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.810
 because if we capture it we see how the lady 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.970
 is in confrontation with the tower and if 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.769
 capture the horse quietly 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:03.400
 after for 5 and for 5 the lady 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:07.030
 is attacked by the tower and the bishop of 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.510
 gary kasparov is also attacked by 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.900
 so after the lady retire 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.470
 to efe 8 for example f 1 sorry then 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.389
 then they would capture the bishop from c4 to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.699
 dÃ©por c4 and bisbe would kill to recover 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.720
 the piece that had been lost by the attack 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.260
 double of the pawn 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.260
 but 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:46.940
 Garry Kasparov is that when Adam 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.990
 remove bishop ag6 gary kasparov as 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.370
 I say remove the lady 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.860
 1 and now with this lady play of 1 the 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.320
 circumstances of the position change and 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.390
 it seems a lie that now has not been given 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.280
 I do not know if this game was 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.450
 a fast game I do not know either 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.220
 true science 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.710
 it was probably a quick game 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.840
 because a champion of characteristics of 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.210
 of ananke we already know what kind of 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.930
 champions did not realize this 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.750
 play since gary kasparov withdrew 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.480
 the lady for later and capture the 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.700
 horse because now yes in the next 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.780
 played so you can capture here 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.930
 when Gary Kasbarov retired the lady the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.370
 Visit should have played horse 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.880
 fed of 6 attacking the bishop with a 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.510
 position more than respectable but as already 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.630
 I tell you 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:50.100
 thinking about the play is of the lady of 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:53.040
 that he would recover piece because he played great f5 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.280
 error on the part of d aran since 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.130
 now it does allow the capture of the 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.790
 horse and does not recover piece because no 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.690
 retrieves piece here when kasparov did 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.690
 Yes now 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.320
 x from 5 bis vi gave up quickly 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.500
 since now he did realize 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.729
 that his position was lost because he 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.839
 he gave up because now 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:26.349
 and by 5 there is no capture of this 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:30.400
 bishop although the lady is attacked because 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:33.460
 the bishop can retire to 2 because of that 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.770
 it was precisely the movement of the 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.050
 lady kick lady 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.889
 why kaspar today I carry the lady of 1 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:46.599
 since now as I say to you with bishop 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:49.089
 e 2 the bishop retires leaving the 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:55.029
 threat of the worst and is for action 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:57.279
 of the tower on the lady and the pieces 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:59.559
 white in this case gary kasparov has 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:02.289
 won a full horse that's why 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:04.790
 precisely network surrendered and no longer 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:08.480
 they serve plays type 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.490
 Lady of 6 since this is position 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.100
 now you can defend peacefully or 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.260
 good via c3 horse defending 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.550
 doubly 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:22.700
 bishop with horse and lady or via king 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.070
 f1 also defending good friends 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.960
 if you liked this game of these 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.970
 two giants of chess so make a 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.500
 I like to leave it in comment 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.570
 first if you pass by here you are not 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.740
 and see you in the next video a 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.740
 greeting to all friends
