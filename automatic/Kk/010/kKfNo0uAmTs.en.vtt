00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
this is obviously talking about radar

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.139 
this is obviously talking about radar
here<00:01:22.219> it's<00:01:23.219> always<00:01:23.399> a<00:01:23.429> very<00:01:23.579> interesting

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
here it's always a very interesting

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
thing but if something is then tracked

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.389 
thing but if something is then tracked
on<00:01:30.749> radar<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> same<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.859> and<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> Air

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399

Force<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.939> verify<00:01:33.359> that<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:34.079> obviously

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
Force can verify that that's obviously

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.459 
Force can verify that that's obviously
hugely<00:01:35.310> significant<00:01:36.109> this<00:01:37.109> is<00:01:37.229> absolutely

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
hugely significant this is absolutely

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.559 
hugely significant this is absolutely
fascinating<00:01:37.829> stuff<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.789> people<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.359> have

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569

fascinating stuff and people will have
their<00:01:39.600> own<00:01:40.219> areas<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.340> interest<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:41.999> some<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
their own areas of interest but some of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.989 
their own areas of interest but some of
the<00:01:42.810> personal<00:01:43.229> highlights<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.100> me<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.460> was

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 
the personal highlights for me I was

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.450 
the personal highlights for me I was
interested<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.659> slightly<00:01:46.229> amused<00:01:46.499> to<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
interested and slightly amused to see a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.959 
interested and slightly amused to see a
very<00:01:48.439> interesting<00:01:49.439> case<00:01:49.950> where<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.700> whole

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
very interesting case where a whole

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.849 
very interesting case where a whole
bunch<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.859> staff<00:01:52.859> and<00:01:53.189> customers<00:01:53.369> at<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.969> pub

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
bunch of staff and customers at a pub

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.590 
bunch of staff and customers at a pub
actually<00:01:55.859> saw<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.310> bright<00:01:56.579> white<00:01:56.880> light<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
actually saw a bright white light and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.379 
actually saw a bright white light and
with<00:01:58.530> laden<00:01:59.069> green<00:01:59.310> lights<00:01:59.609> on<00:01:59.909> either<00:02:00.060> side

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:00.389 
with laden green lights on either side

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.149 
with laden green lights on either side
and<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.139> the<00:02:01.259> clincher<00:02:01.679> in<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> case

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and I think the clincher in this case

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.429 
and I think the clincher in this case
was<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.729> when<00:02:03.270> asked<00:02:03.630> what<00:02:03.749> direction<00:02:04.109> this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
was that when asked what direction this

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.569 
was that when asked what direction this
was<00:02:04.679> they<00:02:04.889> said<00:02:05.069> well<00:02:05.249> it<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
was they said well it was in the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.800 
was they said well it was in the
direction<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.030> Gatwick<00:02:06.420> Airport<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.139> I<00:02:07.889> think

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
direction of Gatwick Airport and I think

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.639 
direction of Gatwick Airport and I think
possibility<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.020> might<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.410> been<00:02:10.560> an

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
possibility that might have been an

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.850 
possibility that might have been an
aeroplane<00:02:10.950> 24<00:02:11.790> /<00:02:12.180> 19<00:02:12.690> 22<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.680> very

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
aeroplane 24 / 19 22 there's very

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.520 
aeroplane 24 / 19 22 there's very
interesting<00:02:14.540> illustration<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.500> fact

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
interesting illustration of the fact

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.950 
interesting illustration of the fact
that<00:02:16.830> actually<00:02:17.400> UFOs<00:02:18.030> are<00:02:18.210> seen<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.450> built-up

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
that actually UFOs are seen in built-up

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.800 
that actually UFOs are seen in built-up
areas<00:02:19.380> people<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:19.980> idea<00:02:20.040> they'd<00:02:20.460> seen

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
areas people have this idea they'd seen
