00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.389
 so it looks very good everything very well 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.230
 your windows phone but anyway the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.769
 need to use something like this here 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.769
 and there how it does 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.570
 Speak galera, I'm Rodrigo, this is the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 windows phone diaries episode 01 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.289
 and I'll tell you the first time. 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.640
 question that I came across that says 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.769
 respect to the use he makes 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.369
 the smartphones of the day 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.350
 on the day 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 at least when this smartphone is and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.780
 west android that are those shortcuts 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 for functions like wifi or bluetooth 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.129
 usually slide your finger up to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 the screen and has shortcuts to these 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.289
 functions what does not happen here on windows 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 phone he does not have these - all you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.239
 uses it is in this home screen 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.399
 even if you have some Taiwanese the living is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.199
 which shows information but is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.910
 limited is that same system 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.160
 So I'll tell you a little about the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 applications that I found in the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.979
 windows phone to get around 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.830
 this situation there 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.080
 the first was the short shorts and I 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 we have basically to have access to the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 wifi data functions 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.189
 I think it's cool because it shows in the icon 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.600
 from the home screen if these functions 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.280
 whether or not they are used 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.170
 example , that's when I was connected, you got 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.840
 a neighbor and when you play you already 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 has access to the less internal 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.420
 system 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 the second was an application called 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.659
 esteiro style the speaking style style 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.400
 on the battery and also gives access to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.040
 other functions such as those I already 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.990
 I used with the previous application but 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.200
 I would rather use it only for 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 see the percentage of the battery it gives 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.829
 including a preview of how long the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.680
 phone will stay connected if you 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.450
 use the same way as the third 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.799
 application of a very simple function 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.329
 but it has already left me very ill. 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.490
 accustomed in recent times to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.680
 function of the flashlight and this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.259
 I went easy on the microsoft store 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.170
 I also found the flash lite application 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.030
 x between several others is not a very thing 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.310
 simple you play and he 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 it the antenna of your phone without the flash 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.959
 like a flashlight and you have a 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.510
 Z button is too large to turn off the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.130
 It's very simple for you to have here. 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.290
 whereas other functions such as 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.209
 calculator they are already available in the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 active on the system then it's just you 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.620
 put a link to them on the screen 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 you will now have access to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
 there are some functions that I missed 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.430
 for example none of these applications 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.890
 managing shortcuts was able to bring 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 a shortcut to the brightness does not even 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.550
 how to manage the brightness that way 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.050
 that I said earlier 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.000
 I do not know why I think it's a thing. 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.890
 very simple to do but so far no 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.290
 was made for you to access the bc has to 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.250
 even enter the windows phone menu 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.810
 which requires a few steps there now that the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.550
 people are talking about shortcuts I'm going 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.170
 talk about another function that looks like 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.209
 but it can not be solved with 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.790
 system applications even have to 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.060
 to incorporate that is one back to the beginning 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.190
 the screen in applications or browser by 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.660
 example is in instagram that you will 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.819
 Rolling the page will scroll there in 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.860
 down and wants to get back in the beginning iof by 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.840
 example you just play in the bay 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.610
 upper and it comes back but on windows 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.220
 phone did not find a similar function 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.510
 with that if you know, I wish 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.340
 Tell me, thank you. 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 It's something that I got very used to. 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.060
 to use and that made me a big mistake 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.920
 When are you going down there to come back? 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.100
 The top of the windows phone has to do 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.750
 scroll the inverse all over again 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.310
 and since I mentioned the internet browser 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.959
 explorer I can speak more 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.030
 about it 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.739
 further, but one thing that does not 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.680
 I liked it a lot. 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.660
 guides the browser tabs 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.090
 when you're in the internet explorer 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.310
 windows phone and opens a new tab is 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 as if it opened a new page and 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.730
 it bothered me a little for you 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.530
 walking between the guides is a good 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.750
 delayed this thing I even noticed 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.870
 diakitÃ© spain looked like a browser 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.700
 but in this sense it seems that 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.030
 became ugly for others like 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.400
 mobile club safari 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.650
 this is a very simple report on 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.530
 this shortcut question what I did to 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.390
 improve what could not improve 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.159
 If you have suggestions, of course this is 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.170
 super welcome here in this series 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.570
 but today I'm staying here with 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.890
 I liked you, sign up for the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.910
 channel will be the first time it is 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.620
 passing by here 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.620
 This is it, hello, hello.
