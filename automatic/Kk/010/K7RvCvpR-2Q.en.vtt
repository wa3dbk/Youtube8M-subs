my<00:00:35.850> arm<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.719> decided<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.530> gonna<00:00:37.680> try<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
my arm and I decided I was gonna try and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.490 
my arm and I decided I was gonna try and
take<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.700> dance<00:00:38.879> classes<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.110> started<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
take some dance classes and I started to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
take some dance classes and I started to
look<00:00:40.590> into<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> various<00:00:41.430> dance<00:00:41.730> classes<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
look into the various dance classes and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.580 
look into the various dance classes and
I<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.920> turned<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.149> tap<00:00:45.899> dancing<00:00:46.410> I

I was really turned on to tap dancing I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
I was really turned on to tap dancing I
think<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> percussion

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
think it was because of the percussion

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
think it was because of the percussion
