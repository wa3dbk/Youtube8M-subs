no I planted quite a few seeds and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
no I planted quite a few seeds and
that's<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:24.660> you're<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that's the way you're going to do it you

are<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.690> viable<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
are going to be viable and that's what I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.040 
are going to be viable and that's what I
have<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.160> eight<00:00:35.399> viable<00:00:35.820> plants<00:00:36.149> in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
have here I have eight viable plants in

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.569 
have here I have eight viable plants in
the<00:00:37.200> front<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.739> two<00:00:37.890> Chinese<00:00:38.250> elm

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the front here I have two Chinese elm

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
the front here I have two Chinese elm
it's<00:00:38.850> interesting<00:00:39.120> how<00:00:39.360> Chinese<00:00:39.840> own<00:00:40.110> with

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it's interesting how Chinese own with

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
it's interesting how Chinese own with
the<00:00:40.290> slowest<00:00:40.620> growers<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> they<00:00:42.000> probably

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the slowest growers and they probably

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.610 
the slowest growers and they probably
going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.629> wonderful<00:00:42.899> bond<00:00:43.200> site<00:00:43.379> because

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
going to be wonderful bond site because

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.420 
going to be wonderful bond site because
the<00:00:43.710> Leafs<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.280> leaves<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.180> small<00:00:46.430> I'd

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the Leafs the leaves is so small I'd

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
the Leafs the leaves is so small I'd
like<00:00:47.579> well<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> bonsai<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.960> have

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
like well I like all the bonsai I have

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.220 
like well I like all the bonsai I have
the<00:00:50.190> Japanese<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.300> Japanese<00:00:51.840> pagoda

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the Japanese put for Japanese pagoda

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.889 
the Japanese put for Japanese pagoda
here<00:00:52.850> those<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.059> seem<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.690> well

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
here those have seem to have done well

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.979 
here those have seem to have done well
and<00:00:55.320> terminated<00:00:56.010> well<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.719> they<00:00:57.719> were<00:00:57.780> about

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and terminated well and they were about

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
and terminated well and they were about
mid<00:00:58.260> sized<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.219> also<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.609> small

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
mid sized and they also have small

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
mid sized and they also have small
leaves<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.039> those<00:01:02.250> will

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
leaves which is very nice so those will

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.529 
leaves which is very nice so those will
probably<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.760> some<00:01:02.940> great<00:01:03.090> bonsai<00:01:03.480> -

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
probably make some great bonsai -

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.299 
probably make some great bonsai -
they're<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:03.989> traditional<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
they're very traditional and then in the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
they're very traditional and then in the
back<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.850> -<00:01:06.030> tamarind<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
back that I have - tamarind and if you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.170 
back that I have - tamarind and if you
watch<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.890> earlier<00:01:08.040> video<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
watch my earlier video you know the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.850 
watch my earlier video you know the
tamarind<00:01:09.720> shot<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.350> fast<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
tamarind shot up really fast there's a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.520 
tamarind shot up really fast there's a
very<00:01:11.040> big<00:01:11.220> seeds<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.869> spouted<00:01:13.350> pretty

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
very big seeds and they spouted pretty

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
very big seeds and they spouted pretty
quick<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.760> grew<00:01:15.060> pretty<00:01:15.330> quick<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
quick and they grew pretty quick so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.670 
quick and they grew pretty quick so
these<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.590> big<00:01:18.409> bonsai<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
these are going to be big bonsai but I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
these are going to be big bonsai but I
will<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.100> course<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.640> bonsai<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
will of course you know bonsai them to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.620 
will of course you know bonsai them to
keep<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:22.140> small<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> pretty<00:01:24.240> big<00:01:24.390> plant

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
keep them small but a pretty big plant

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
keep them small but a pretty big plant
so<00:01:24.840> there's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> distinct<00:01:25.920> difference<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so there's a distinct difference in the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.580 
so there's a distinct difference in the
size<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> types<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> trees<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> how

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
size there in the types of trees and how

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.260 
size there in the types of trees and how
they<00:01:28.740> grow<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:29.759> doing<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
they grow but they're doing well it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.539 
they grow but they're doing well it's
been<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.540> months<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:32.040> might<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.280> looking

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
been two months and you might be looking

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.620 
been two months and you might be looking
at<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> tamarind<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.270> saying<00:01:33.420> what's<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
at the tamarind and saying what's the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.469 
at the tamarind and saying what's the
deal<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> leaves<00:01:34.909> actually<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.150> didn't

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
deal with the leaves actually I didn't

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.280 
deal with the leaves actually I didn't
know<00:01:36.509> fronds<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:38.670> tamarind<00:01:39.509> actually

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
know fronds on those tamarind actually

least<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.170> did<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.319> me<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.340> same<00:02:23.459> thing

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
least it did for me and the same thing

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.750 
least it did for me and the same thing
to<00:02:23.880> open<00:02:24.150> back<00:02:24.270> up<00:02:24.480> again<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.350> ran<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> camera

and<00:02:27.630> caught<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.470> compressed<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and caught that and then compressed it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.770 
and caught that and then compressed it
down<00:02:29.340> into<00:02:29.550> about<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.209> about<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> minute

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
down into about I think about a minute

down into about I think about a minute
so<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.350> watch<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.739> closed<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.519> then<00:02:32.970> open

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
so you watch it closed and then open

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.150 
so you watch it closed and then open
it's<00:02:33.330> really<00:02:33.570> pretty<00:02:33.870> interesting<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.980> the
