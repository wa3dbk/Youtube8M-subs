00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
the meat and going to the vegetables
first<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.939> I've<00:01:54.450> done<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
first but I've done that just going to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.550 
first but I've done that just going to
cut<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> ends<00:01:55.890> off<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> zucchini<00:01:56.430> here

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
cut the ends off of the zucchini here
put<00:01:58.560> those<00:01:58.680> aside<00:01:58.890> I'm<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.000> cut<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
put those aside I'm going to cut it in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.200 
put those aside I'm going to cut it in
half<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.070> then<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> cut<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> long

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
half and then just going to cut it long

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.109 
half and then just going to cut it long
ways<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.509> couple<00:02:03.930> times<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.670> makes<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
ways a couple times so that it makes it

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.740 
ways a couple times so that it makes it
quicker<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.140> easier<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.220> grill

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
quicker and a little easier on the grill

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.290 
quicker and a little easier on the grill
when<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> throw<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:11.180> that'll<00:02:12.180> actually

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
when you throw it on that'll actually

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
when you throw it on that'll actually
probably<00:02:12.629> work<00:02:12.870> but

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
probably work but

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
probably work but
that'll<00:02:14.070> work<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.820> go<00:02:14.970> ahead<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.270> three

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
that'll work so go ahead and do three

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.530 
that'll work so go ahead and do three
slices<00:02:15.990> on<00:02:16.110> each<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.820> really<00:02:18.060> good<00:02:18.270> on

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
slices on each this is really good on

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.180 
slices on each this is really good on
the<00:02:18.750> grill<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:20.420> cooks<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:21.930> well

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the grill it just cooks up really well

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.620 
the grill it just cooks up really well
and<00:02:23.190> they<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.180> perfect

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and they don't have to be perfect

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.000 
and they don't have to be perfect
basically<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.410> you're<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> be<00:02:25.800> doing
