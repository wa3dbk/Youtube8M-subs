00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.810
 incentive to do it wrong to have 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.400

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.760

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.160

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 30 closer to 10 in general in the morning I ate 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.439
 portion of oatmeal for the first time with 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.439

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.299
 then I ate another banana just 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.060
 so before training already ate more 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.340
 a serving of big oatmeal with a view 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 but you ate about the last spoon 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.640
 tel for one hour twenty to workout because 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.090

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.979
 before training legs right in front of her 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.640
 there is no other will be bad 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.860
 vomit bath and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.909
 in an hour twenty it is normal not to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.790

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.780

 disassemble your cosmetic bag and show 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.590
 began to wear 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.229
 But I have bought everything much easier 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.990
 four bananas store well i always 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.990
 In principle , we have this business in front of the hall 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.510
 Cocktail shop 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.350
 with a banana also in a blender done well and 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.410
 water and a half liters without gas naturally 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.239
 everyone is now starting to workout a 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.600
 today is still weighing in by the way today 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:34.519
 weighing thursday day weighing and 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.000
 we see how grown grew now soon 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.000
 see 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.590
 the machine has arrived 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.209
 and start therefore my ipad avoid l.ya. 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.209
 be wary 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.540
 This kind of training today was very 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.910
 a short total of three basic exercises 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.580
 plus to this exercise which said 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.050
 we 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.770
 one approach hyperextension with 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.200
 virgin 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.270
 no approach to the press and the rise of the legs in 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.820
 measles in principle always do these 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.520
 pre-workout exercises worked 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.080
 today above the back of the thigh 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.130
 despite the fact that only three exercises 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.750
 but the end of the forces simply does not remain 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.120
 lunges very slaughter just exercise 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.050
 try to lunge in smith either with 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.600
 dumbbells 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.790
 even with a small weight the load is very 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.229
 big and very hard to do here 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:27.919
 today was weighing here is my weight 80 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:31.310
 and 65 to 85 kilograms and today receive 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:34.880
 fixed result plus four with 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.350
 half a kilogram for this term here 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.560
 winter term my goals that is it turns out 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.740
 Two months now, I'm moving, of course, I am behind 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.080
 from your schedule yes well done 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.729
 correct goals but for the remaining half 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.800
 much less time left 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.360
 but no less moving forward is 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.910
 very cool in principle and did not doubt 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.190
 someone doubted that I did not doubt 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.540
 that will grow here there is much more 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.330
 long term 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.900
 more goals and so on its main go 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.270
 I'm weighing up with them I asked someone what 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.840
 rather I say there with them sneakers yes 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.510
 here is a fact we fix i fix 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.400
 the fact of growth that is, well, and this is me and at the beginning 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.470
 experiment was hung in sneakers and 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.480
 in the same sneakers I have in them 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.430
 I weigh 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.840
 one and a half years of the very first occupation as 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.970
 just started going to the gym 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.650
 that's why I'm in the very beginning 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.170
 holding back in the same shorts 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.080
 which are very light yes therefore we 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.970
 just look progress that is plus 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.220
 four and a half kilos i like 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:39.470
 then I was in sneakers and now 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.600
 after training I ate everything 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.680
 showed respectively bananas protein 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.840
 and so on and immediately home to the reception 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.500
