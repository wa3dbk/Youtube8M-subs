didn't like this sheath I mean now the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.170 
didn't like this sheath I mean now the
sheath<00:00:18.570> itself<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.890> okay<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.910> wish<00:00:21.150> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
sheath itself just is okay but I wish it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.900 
sheath itself just is okay but I wish it
rode<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.410> bit<00:00:22.560> higher<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
rode up a little bit higher because it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.570 
rode up a little bit higher because it
just<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.300> felt<00:00:24.480> uncomfortable<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.560> felt<00:00:26.430> like

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
just it felt uncomfortable I felt like

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.279 
just it felt uncomfortable I felt like
the<00:00:26.699> knife<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:27.060> gonna<00:00:27.180> fall<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:27.930> or

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the knife was gonna fall out or

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:28.759 
the knife was gonna fall out or
something

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
something

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.519 
something
and<00:00:29.130> also<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.580> discussing<00:00:30.570> those<00:00:30.960> or

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and also I was discussing those or

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.990 
and also I was discussing those or
tension<00:00:32.099> issues<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.510> mean<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.730> really

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
tension issues I mean so it's not really

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
tension issues I mean so it's not really
a<00:00:36.030> reliable<00:00:36.600> sheath<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:38.300> is<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.870> mean<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a reliable sheath or is it I mean so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.500 
a reliable sheath or is it I mean so
what<00:00:40.950> I've<00:00:41.070> found<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.329> guess

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
what I've found out is I guess

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
what I've found out is I guess
technically<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> blade<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.739> supposed<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
technically the blade was supposed to be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.819 
technically the blade was supposed to be
able<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> lock<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.079> sheath<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
able to lock into this sheath but I

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
able to lock into this sheath but I
never<00:00:46.980> learned<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.140> never<00:00:49.140> found<00:00:49.469> out

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
never learned out how I never found out

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.400 
never learned out how I never found out
how<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> never<00:00:50.100> learned<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> go

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
how I never learned how but there you go

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.779 
how I never learned how but there you go
I<00:00:53.750> was<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.050> felt<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:55.980> stupid<00:00:56.280> after<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I was I felt really stupid after I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.229 
I was I felt really stupid after I
learned<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.420> mean<00:00:57.840> look<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.320> just

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
learned that I mean look at that it just

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.689 
learned that I mean look at that it just
really<00:01:00.239> well<00:01:00.359> locks<00:01:00.719> into<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> sheath<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
really well locks into the sheath all I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.590 
really well locks into the sheath all I
have<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.239> push<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.070> then<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.600> see

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have to do is push and then you can see

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100 
have to do is push and then you can see
it's<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:08.130> higher<00:01:08.369> than<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.540> did<00:01:09.659> before

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
not much higher but I don't have to make

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
not much higher but I don't have to make
it<00:01:12.150> feel<00:01:12.330> comfortable<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you could attach this to a vest or

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.890 
you could attach this to a vest or
something<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> wanted<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
something if you wanted to make it a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.670 
something if you wanted to make it a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
tactical knife but so the way you do it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
tactical knife but so the way you do it
just<00:01:31.920> push<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.210> tell<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.819 
little plastic line there you just push
that<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.390> go

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
that and then there you go

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.160 
that and then there you go

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
disadvantage is that it will kind of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.760 
disadvantage is that it will kind of
scratch<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:24.050> blade<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.350> little<00:03:24.500> bit<00:03:26.770> like

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
scratch the blade a little bit like

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.160 
scratch the blade a little bit like
they're<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:30.230> because<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:31.490> sheath<00:03:32.170> being

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
they're just because of the sheath being

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.770 
they're just because of the sheath being
