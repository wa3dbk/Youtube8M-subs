a lens cloth itself as Fujifilm stamped

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.800 
a lens cloth itself as Fujifilm stamped
and<00:01:19.569> bust<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.700> as<00:01:22.179> I<00:01:22.270> said<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.509> was<00:01:22.569> a<00:01:22.659> little

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
now for the real deal let's see what

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.489 
now for the real deal let's see what
it's<00:01:45.670> like<00:01:45.819> let's<00:01:46.450> pop<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.689> open<00:01:46.959> very

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
it's like let's pop that open very

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:56.800 
it's like let's pop that open very
similar<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.039> how<00:01:48.159> 235<00:01:49.439> was

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.540 

that's<00:01:57.810> metallic<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.620> there<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.830> lens<00:01:59.070> cap<00:01:59.340> for

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
that's metallic is there a lens cap for

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.570 
that's metallic is there a lens cap for
when<00:01:59.700> you're<00:01:59.820> using<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.330> hood<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:01.560> these<00:02:01.890> are

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
when you're using the hood now these are

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.220 
when you're using the hood now these are
nice<00:02:03.050> but<00:02:04.050> they<00:02:04.230> tend<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> come<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:04.920> easily<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
nice but they tend to come off easily I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.650 
nice but they tend to come off easily I
won't<00:02:07.230> be<00:02:07.350> surprised<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.160> lose<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.850> fairly

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
won't be surprised if I lose one fairly

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.420 
won't be surprised if I lose one fairly
soon<00:02:09.990> but<00:02:10.530> basically<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.780> lives<00:02:12.990> on<00:02:13.170> there

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
soon but basically that lives on there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.860 
soon but basically that lives on there
so<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.520> gives<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:14.970> bit<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.150> extra

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
so it gives you a little bit of extra

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.010 
so it gives you a little bit of extra
protection<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:17.340> comes<00:02:18.030> off<00:02:18.210> pretty<00:02:18.780> easily

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
protection but comes off pretty easily

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.840 
protection but comes off pretty easily
so<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.640> careful<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:25.610> nice<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
so just be careful of that nice and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.030 
so just be careful of that nice and
small

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040

there's the aperture ring snap cap which

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.640 
there's the aperture ring snap cap which
I<00:02:33.360> actually<00:02:33.540> personally<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.470> if<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.620> use

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I actually personally like but if I use

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.620 
I actually personally like but if I use
the<00:02:34.980> hood<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.459> cap<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:35.970> no<00:02:36.090> longer<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.570> in

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the hood the cap will no longer be in

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.199 
the hood the cap will no longer be in
use<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.140> there's<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> lens<00:02:37.680> itself<00:02:38.209> dead

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209
