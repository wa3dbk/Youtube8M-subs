00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.490
 I think I later that Talpa made the couple pretty saved pretty 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 Hey 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.149
 h 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.609
 it is already 8 years ago that power was last in france 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.659
 seized in the world 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.569
 immediately mafia 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.520
 Italian descent 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.130
 for something in between 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.170
 several bags of the mafia 2 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 after a great location and 5 2 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.150
 we want the mafia 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.130
 People who had some sort of no theater did not immediately drop out of it 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.620
 it is not twice 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 it is necessary the first that they are only at that time be the two is it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 life story telling his teammate serious is central in these times 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 we like it 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.180
 but later were allowed to do it themselves and this leads to a dirty business 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.340
 in practice it means that you achieve a lot from point a to b 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.520
 a conversation 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.090
 and there is the action, the action is not always accompanied by 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.969
 shootings 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.720
 the regular basis thereof 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.270
 most of the game because of driving car location 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.680
 9 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.280
 the stone nsi think to be able to dissolve silently sitting normally certainly does not celebrate 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 at which 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 those people are better off going for a clean sheet 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.750
 people with patience 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.830
 greenpeace in his area incorporated in the game are some car driving 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.909
 may sound boring 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.229
 that is not at all, although there is a second free tank and forget too 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.460
 great it is not wiser to drive 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.720
 and that of course can not be missing in your car 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.530
 why these specific requirements can change amnesty while driving 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.580
 The authentic music from that time make this a good start 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.460
 the evening it became atmospheric music etc 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.950
 In addition, a letter met on the way also wants the police around one 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.330
 given moment of the eighth place, the more blue on the worst 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.640
 to prepare 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.919
 if the result does not get with 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.289
 in front of the police does not do crazy things 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.069
 I found it in the US 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.350
 if you didn't bump into the opponent's car neatly at the race 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.499
 it will pursue the police 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.280
 or do you want a lot lighter later 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.450
 they better stop if the police this is what they lost policy 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.769
 If she comes to the end, you can do it wherever you want big cities 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.029
 you have to do is make sure that you remain unseen 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.159
 so here also applies once the police is not p the cottage 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.510
 it is the diversity that adorns the game 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 and there are several options for avoiding the police 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.609
 when they buy the agents granderson 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.999
 if you have stolen a car you can go to a garage for it 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.999
 number plate to heat up the color of the car make eyes spray 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.320
 of course you can also take a hard approach from the police 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.960
 although in practice it can sometimes be tricky especially if there are more than 18 years 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.399
 to sit on 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:02.019
 in addition to the drivers and shootings also very cool promotes no use 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.509
 of cheaper system 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.379
 the weapons that you can carry with you indefinitely, they stopped the signals from the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.359
 surrounds 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.249
 in that of the feyenoord not the best they encounter in the game amersfoort 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:12.659
 yet 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.649
 we have enough 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:18.059
 in fact 4 2 also received their talent which, unfortunately, is rather disappointing 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.829
 so that as you progress the fights become more difficult because the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.929
 opponent goes up 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.429
 but it is still just a matter of being able to dodge pizza on impressions one 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.259
 garage sale 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.219
 although mafia 2 volpi pill strip that definitely did not go unnoticed 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.909
 did not claim that the core is perfect 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.429
 that is not because 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:41.539
 according to the un, the image of the risk on the world map is promoted 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.339
 that is far too little to be done 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.139
 his mission is not there 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.049
 you have a goal to go to and in the meantime go somewhere else 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.149
 driving options are very limited 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.859
 Furthermore, certain elements can be repetitive if, for example, you reach your goal 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.109
 has reached the end of a chapter so that you are again 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.249
 return home 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.369
 have to sleep there and then it's the end of the chapter 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:06.339
 With that money you always have your home location in sponsoring the car 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.979
 drove 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.149
 and then you are already in the car enough and let the whole game a point a to 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.439
 b 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.190
 after ten hours of play, the end credits for mosley are equivalent to the 8 hours of play 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.319
 because about two hours of student cities is the injury 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.309
 this makes the game a lot shorter than many expect and of course 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:23.550
 had hoped 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.880
 most the ballot box that you really have seen everything you can but 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.879
 online shops in the magazines I understand 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.840
 there you go to one of the sponsors 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.280
 but how spout 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.740
 the minor flaws and flaws that we largely overlooked w 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.290
 has just become a powerful familiar with the story as the common thread 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.110
 friend 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.800
 it is the image you do not expect and the action and you have always been in the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.349
 want to play a mafia movie 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.590
 all this should be the rose in 2010 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.150
 bol.com system 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.570
 Petersburg and also for the garden 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.570
 mafia 2 has been well worth the wait 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:07.159
 what
