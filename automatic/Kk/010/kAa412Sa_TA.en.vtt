what's happening with the hourly chart

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.749 
what's happening with the hourly chart
here<00:02:06.509> okay<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.470> not<00:02:07.619> only<00:02:07.830> did<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
here okay but not only did we have this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
here okay but not only did we have this
resistance<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.500> above<00:02:10.769> us<00:02:11.009> though

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
resistance here at just above us though

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.089 
resistance here at just above us though
at<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.700> 805<00:02:12.299> we<00:02:12.720> had<00:02:12.930> massive<00:02:13.470> daily

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
at the 805 we had massive daily

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.369 
at the 805 we had massive daily
resistance<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.939> so<00:02:15.450> what<00:02:15.629> was<00:02:15.720> happening<00:02:16.200> was

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
resistance and so what was happening was

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.990 
resistance and so what was happening was
just<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> point<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:17.519> they<00:02:17.670> were<00:02:17.790> getting

and shore up you know a new trend here

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.770 
and shore up you know a new trend here
but<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:39.880> they<00:02:40.090> were<00:02:40.120> pretty<00:02:40.480> weak

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
but as you can see they were pretty weak

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.200 
but as you can see they were pretty weak
and<00:02:41.110> wavy<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:42.250> they<00:02:42.520> were<00:02:42.580> not<00:02:42.820> convicted

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
and wavy to they were not convicted

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.370 
and wavy to they were not convicted
trends<00:02:43.690> by<00:02:43.810> any<00:02:43.960> stretch<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.320> imagination

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
trends by any stretch of the imagination

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.220 
trends by any stretch of the imagination
in<00:02:44.890> fact<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> only<00:02:45.220> convicted<00:02:45.850> trend<00:02:46.360> was<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
in fact the only convicted trend was the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.430 
in fact the only convicted trend was the
trend<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.400> downside<00:02:48.640> here<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.140> you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
trend to the downside here and so you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.590 
trend to the downside here and so you
know<00:02:50.590> my<00:02:50.740> comment<00:02:51.160> was<00:02:51.190> no<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.360> not

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
know my comment was no that's just not

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.750 
know my comment was no that's just not
going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> go<00:02:52.990> ahead<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.560> cut<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.190> me<00:02:54.220> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
going to go ahead and cut it for me that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.970 
going to go ahead and cut it for me that
is<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.940> high<00:02:55.330> risk<00:02:55.360> low<00:02:55.870> probability<00:02:56.530> place<00:02:56.770> to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
is a high risk low probability place to

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.670 
is a high risk low probability place to
take<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.190> long<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.930> moral<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.380> story

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
take a long and so the moral the story

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.860 
take a long and so the moral the story
here<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:01.000> careful<00:03:01.210> when<00:03:01.570> you're<00:03:01.660> focused

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
here is be careful when you're focused

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.660 
here is be careful when you're focused

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
on these very short-term time frames if

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.430 
on these very short-term time frames if
you<00:03:03.790> don't<00:03:04.210> keep<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> higher<00:03:05.110> time<00:03:05.410> frame

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
you don't keep of the higher time frame

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.380 
you don't keep of the higher time frame
in<00:03:05.920> mind<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.340> what's<00:03:06.520> taking<00:03:06.700> place<00:03:06.910> in<00:03:07.270> this

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390
