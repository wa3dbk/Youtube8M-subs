00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
into the ignition of any turbo vehicle

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.279 
into the ignition of any turbo vehicle
course<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.060> turbo<00:00:21.330> timer<00:00:21.539> device<00:00:21.990> which

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
course the turbo timer device which

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.730 
course the turbo timer device which
delays<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.800> shutdown<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> ignition<00:00:24.210> and

delays the shutdown of the ignition and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.080 
delays the shutdown of the ignition and
that<00:00:25.740> allows<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.250> turbo<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> spool<00:00:26.910> down

that allows the turbo to spool down

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.060 
that allows the turbo to spool down
that's<00:00:27.599> increasing<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> life<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> turbo

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that's increasing the life of the turbo
