00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.640 
hint for my next let's play we can't say

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.620 
hint for my next let's play we can't say
what<00:07:53.790> anyone's<00:07:54.210> interested<00:07:54.840> it's<00:07:56.180> solely<00:07:57.180> a

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:57.630 
what anyone's interested it's solely a

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.730 
what anyone's interested it's solely a
number<00:07:59.870> but<00:08:00.870> that<00:08:01.110> kind<00:08:01.380> of<00:08:01.410> gives<00:08:01.590> it<00:08:01.680> away

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 
number but that kind of gives it away

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.150 
number but that kind of gives it away
but<00:08:02.190> it's<00:08:02.520> a<00:08:02.610> very<00:08:02.760> unknown<00:08:03.270> game<00:08:03.480> so<00:08:04.160> how
