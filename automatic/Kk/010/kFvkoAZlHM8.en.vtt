00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
up on the rotor head assembly you pull

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.260 
up on the rotor head assembly you pull
up<00:01:26.259> from<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.890> get<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.430> camera<00:01:30.790> here<00:01:31.090> you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
up from and get this in camera here you

up from and get this in camera here you
pull<00:01:31.930> up<00:01:32.080> from<00:01:32.350> this<00:01:32.830> assembly<00:01:33.430> here<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.369> this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
pull up from this assembly here and this

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.940 
pull up from this assembly here and this
is<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.420> hole<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.200> part<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.860> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
is that hole this is the part of the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.010 
is that hole this is the part of the
head<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.280> actually<00:01:39.640> holds<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.090> links<00:01:40.900> to

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
head that actually holds the links to

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.330 
head that actually holds the links to
the<00:01:41.110> rotor<00:01:41.259> head<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.890> want<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.070> do<00:01:42.190> this

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the rotor head you want to do this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.540 
the rotor head you want to do this
because<00:01:42.490> if<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.270> pull<00:01:43.660> on<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.080> grips<00:01:44.550> there's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
because if you pull on the grips there's

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.760 
because if you pull on the grips there's
a<00:01:45.640> very<00:01:45.960> strong<00:01:46.960> chance<00:01:47.259> you'll<00:01:47.530> end<00:01:47.680> up

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
a very strong chance you'll end up

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.320 
a very strong chance you'll end up
bending<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.369> spindle<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:49.000> then<00:01:49.090> you'll<00:01:49.210> have

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
bending the spindle and then you'll have

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.370 
bending the spindle and then you'll have
to<00:01:49.450> replace<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.750> too

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
to replace that too

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.499 
to replace that too
so<00:01:50.860> pull<00:01:51.100> up<00:01:51.130> on<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.700> plastic<00:01:52.119> part<00:01:52.330> of<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
so pull up on the plastic part of the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.040 
so pull up on the plastic part of the
head<00:01:53.940> now<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.179> have<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.450> head<00:01:55.660> removed

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
head now that we have the head removed

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.800 
head now that we have the head removed
what<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.800> want<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.009> do<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.429> simply<00:01:57.940> pop<00:01:58.600> off

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
what you want to do is simply pop off

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.219 
what you want to do is simply pop off
the<00:01:59.050> links<00:01:59.440> on<00:01:59.619> the<00:02:00.250> swashplate

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the links on the swashplate

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.480 
the links on the swashplate
it<00:02:02.229> really<00:02:02.440> helps<00:02:02.649> if<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.920> nails<00:02:03.220> for

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
it really helps if you have nails for

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:16.140 
it really helps if you have nails for
this<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.850> want<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.179> all<00:02:10.450> three<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:16.000> then

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
this you want to do all three and then

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.289 
this you want to do all three and then
at<00:02:16.329> that<00:02:16.540> point

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
at that point

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.640 
at that point
carefully<00:02:19.299> pull<00:02:19.540> back<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.079> anti-rotation

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
carefully pull back the anti-rotation

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.259 
carefully pull back the anti-rotation
bracket<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:22.620> simply<00:02:23.620> slide<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.730> swashplate

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
bracket and simply slide the swashplate

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.729

off<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.410> main<00:02:26.560> shaft<00:02:27.989> at<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.230> point<00:02:29.500> you

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
off of the main shaft at this point you

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.030 
off of the main shaft at this point you
set<00:02:29.920> aside<00:02:30.190> your<00:02:30.220> broken<00:02:30.700> swash<00:02:30.910> plate<00:02:31.120> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
set aside your broken swash plate and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.300 
set aside your broken swash plate and
you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.250> take<00:02:33.730> your<00:02:33.880> new<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.980> put<00:02:36.220> it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
you can take your new one you put it

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.300 
you can take your new one you put it
over<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.690> main<00:02:37.930> shaft<00:02:38.200> make<00:02:38.890> sure<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.190> it

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
over the main shaft make sure that it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.920 
over the main shaft make sure that it
lines<00:02:39.459> up<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:40.350> with<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.470> ball<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.970> then

lines up with with the ball and then

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.690 
lines up with with the ball and then
slide<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.380> down<00:02:44.560> making<00:02:45.010> sure<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
slide it down making sure that the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.210 
slide it down making sure that the
anti-rotation<00:02:46.090> pin<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.260> installed<00:02:47.680> into<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
anti-rotation pin is installed into the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.930 
anti-rotation pin is installed into the
bracket<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.470> at<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.739> point<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.610> want<00:02:51.790> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
bracket and at this point you want to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:03.030 
bracket and at this point you want to
reattach<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.900> servo<00:02:53.260> linkages

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.590 

I'm<00:03:04.040> gonna<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.340> very<00:03:04.730> careful<00:03:05.210> when<00:03:05.300> doing

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
I'm gonna be very careful when doing

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.730 
I'm gonna be very careful when doing
this<00:03:05.690> because<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.140> apply<00:03:06.290> too<00:03:06.560> much

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
this because if you apply too much

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.380 
this because if you apply too much
pressure<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.520> wrong<00:03:07.640> direction<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:08.180> can

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
pressure in the wrong direction you can

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.630 
pressure in the wrong direction you can
easily<00:03:08.690> snap<00:03:09.080> one<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.410> balls<00:03:09.650> off<00:03:09.920> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
easily snap one of the balls off and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.310 
easily snap one of the balls off and
then<00:03:10.760> you'll<00:03:10.910> replace<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.690> swashplate<00:03:11.930> again

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.810 

now<00:03:18.320> we<00:03:18.380> have<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.710> swash<00:03:18.920> plate<00:03:19.100> installed<00:03:19.610> as

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
now we have the swash plate installed as

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.230 
now we have the swash plate installed as
time<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.210> reinstall<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.840> rotor<00:03:21.020> head<00:03:22.240> simply

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
time to reinstall the rotor head simply
