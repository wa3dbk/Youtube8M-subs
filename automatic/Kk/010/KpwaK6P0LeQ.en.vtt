00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
magic pencil is pretty dang cool when

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.339 
magic pencil is pretty dang cool when
you<00:03:35.010> right-click<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.239> actually<00:03:36.750> fires

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
arrows at ultra-fast speeds and you

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.250 
arrows at ultra-fast speeds and you
actually<00:03:41.159> need<00:03:41.400> arrows<00:03:41.819> I<00:03:42.030> believe<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:42.750> for

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
actually need arrows I believe for for

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.289 
actually need arrows I believe for for
doing<00:03:43.560> using<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.129> magic<00:03:44.549> pencil<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.180> go

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
doing using this magic pencil so if I go

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.369 
doing using this magic pencil so if I go
back<00:03:45.449> into<00:03:45.629> game-mode<00:03:45.989> 0

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
back into game-mode 0

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.129 
back into game-mode 0
I<00:03:46.530> hold<00:03:47.069> right<00:03:47.280> click<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.909> will<00:03:48.299> consume<00:03:48.870> my

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
I hold right click it will consume my

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.259 
I hold right click it will consume my
arrows<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:49.980> if<00:03:50.099> you<00:03:50.219> hold<00:03:50.459> shift<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:51.060> right

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
arrows now if you hold shift and right

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.509 
arrows now if you hold shift and right
click<00:03:51.569> it<00:03:51.810> will<00:03:52.079> switch<00:03:52.439> into<00:03:52.680> pencil<00:03:53.280> mode

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
click it will switch into pencil mode

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.469 
click it will switch into pencil mode
which<00:03:54.449> is<00:03:54.719> basically<00:03:55.099> how<00:03:56.099> God<00:03:56.579> gives<00:03:57.359> you

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
which is basically how God gives you

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.869 
which is basically how God gives you
slowness<00:03:57.989> every<00:03:58.229> time<00:03:58.409> you<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.739> but<00:03:59.430> yes

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
slowness every time you do it but yes

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.659 
slowness every time you do it but yes
you<00:04:00.540> switch<00:04:00.810> into<00:04:01.169> pencil<00:04:01.769> mode<00:04:02.009> which

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
you switch into pencil mode which

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.030 
you switch into pencil mode which
basically<00:04:02.699> when<00:04:03.689> right<00:04:03.900> clicked<00:04:04.199> upon<00:04:04.590> blocks

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
basically when right clicked upon blocks

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.979 
basically when right clicked upon blocks
it<00:04:05.400> will<00:04:05.579> change<00:04:05.790> them<00:04:06.000> into<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.449> random

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
it will change them into like random

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.740 
it will change them into like random
rules<00:04:07.319> rule<00:04:08.129> blocks<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.819> for<00:04:09.329> some<00:04:09.449> reason<00:04:09.659> it

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
rules rule blocks and for some reason it

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.409 
rules rule blocks and for some reason it
only<00:04:09.870> works<00:04:10.199> like<00:04:10.470> sometimes<00:04:11.159> I<00:04:11.489> guess<00:04:11.759> for

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
only works like sometimes I guess for

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.890 
only works like sometimes I guess for
some<00:04:12.449> reason<00:04:13.519> but<00:04:14.519> like<00:04:15.239> right<00:04:15.419> now<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.750> I

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
some reason but like right now it's I

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.599 
some reason but like right now it's I
guess<00:04:16.049> it's<00:04:16.229> not<00:04:16.409> really<00:04:16.709> working<00:04:17.009> let's<00:04:17.430> try

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
guess it's not really working let's try

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.460 
guess it's not really working let's try
it<00:04:17.669> it's<00:04:18.209> supposed<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.479> change<00:04:18.539> blocks<00:04:19.229> into

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
it it's supposed to change blocks into

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.979 
it it's supposed to change blocks into
random<00:04:19.799> wool<00:04:20.009> colors<00:04:20.400> but<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.359> guess<00:04:21.750> I'd<00:04:21.870> only

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
random wool colors but I guess I'd only

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.240 
random wool colors but I guess I'd only
work<00:04:22.169> sometimes<00:04:22.500> as<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.770> can<00:04:22.860> see<00:04:23.009> so<00:04:23.220> I

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
work sometimes as you can see so I

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.120 
work sometimes as you can see so I
really<00:04:24.150> don't<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.449> maybe<00:04:25.259> maybe<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.830> can

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
really don't know maybe maybe I can

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.560 
really don't know maybe maybe I can
switch<00:04:26.340> back<00:04:26.520> into<00:04:26.699> arrow<00:04:26.849> mode<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.330> kill

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
switch back into arrow mode and kill

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.120 
switch back into arrow mode and kill
that<00:04:27.690> Ocelot<00:04:28.139> over<00:04:28.349> there<00:04:28.470> because<00:04:28.620> freaking

deceptive box to get the magic pencil
you<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.240> craft<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.719> just<00:05:04.020> like<00:05:04.260> this<00:05:04.620> pretty

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
you can craft it just like this pretty

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.239 
you can craft it just like this pretty
simple

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:06.249 
simple

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.549 
simple
cool<00:05:06.759> and<00:05:07.479> once<00:05:07.689> you<00:05:07.779> craft<00:05:08.049> it<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.289> can<00:05:08.439> use

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:08.559 
cool and once you craft it you can use

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.829 
cool and once you craft it you can use
it<00:05:08.709> whatever<00:05:08.889> so<00:05:09.669> let's<00:05:10.089> put<00:05:10.269> this<00:05:10.359> stuff<00:05:10.569> over

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:10.839 
it whatever so let's put this stuff over

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.349 
it whatever so let's put this stuff over
here<00:05:10.869> and<00:05:11.559> pull<00:05:12.219> out<00:05:12.369> the<00:05:12.399> septa<00:05:12.759> box<00:05:12.939> bow

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:13.359 
here and pull out the septa box bow

here and pull out the septa box bow
which<00:05:14.109> i<00:05:14.289> think<00:05:14.349> is<00:05:14.949> only<00:05:15.189> possible<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:16.179> get

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449
