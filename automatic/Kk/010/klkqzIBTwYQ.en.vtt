00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's in the complete tight position so
you<00:00:57.329> always<00:00:57.739> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.120> let<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.300> straps<00:01:00.690> out

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
before you try and put your bra on
because<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.080> remember<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.100> always<00:01:05.339> want

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
because if you remember you always want

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
because if you remember you always want
your<00:01:05.760> bra<00:01:06.060> lower<00:01:06.479> than<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.110> even<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.710> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
your bra lower than or even with your

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.730 
your bra lower than or even with your
bustline<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.570> by<00:01:09.720> letting<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.710> have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bustline so by letting that out you have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.940 
bustline so by letting that out you have
more<00:01:11.100> room<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.119> alright<00:01:12.950> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
then it's probably much easier to slip

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
then it's probably much easier to slip

it'll also cause your wires to pop out
over<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> force<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
over time because the force of the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
over time because the force of the
twisting<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.209> turning<00:02:09.929> upward<00:02:10.140> motion

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
twisting and the turning upward motion

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.509 
twisting and the turning upward motion
causes<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> wires<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.629> come

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
causes the wires to come

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.000 
causes the wires to come
so<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.299> don't<00:02:14.510> see<00:02:14.840> their<00:02:15.049> you<00:02:15.200> don't<00:02:15.590> want<00:02:15.920> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
so you don't see their you don't want to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.350 
so you don't see their you don't want to
do<00:02:16.159> that<00:02:16.310> because<00:02:16.519> you're<00:02:16.760> going<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.970> hurt<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
do that because you're going to hurt the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.089 
do that because you're going to hurt the
bra<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.930> they<00:02:18.110> are<00:02:18.230> going<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.500> be<00:02:18.620> sending<00:02:18.980> it

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
bra and they are going to be sending it

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.710 
bra and they are going to be sending it
back<00:02:19.250> because<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> wire<00:02:19.940> popped<00:02:20.269> out<00:02:20.480> too

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
back because the wire popped out too

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.320 
back because the wire popped out too
soon<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:21.980> you're<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.060> twist

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
soon so if you're going to do the twist

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.170 
soon so if you're going to do the twist
and<00:02:23.540> turn<00:02:23.690> method<00:02:24.200> how<00:02:25.159> else<00:02:25.430> would<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.819> do<00:02:25.970> it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
and turn method how else would you do it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.280 
and turn method how else would you do it
okay<00:02:27.019> so<00:02:27.970> then<00:02:28.970> what<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.239> probably<00:02:29.629> need<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.049> do

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
okay so then what I probably need to do

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.520 
okay so then what I probably need to do
is<00:02:30.590> start<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.220> bra<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.420> upright<00:02:32.780> position

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
is start the bra it's upright position

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.559 
is start the bra it's upright position
perfect

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
perfect

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.869 
perfect
and<00:02:35.569> then<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.799> what<00:02:36.950> hope<00:02:37.159> do<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.459> typically

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
and then in what hope do you typically

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.520 
and then in what hope do you typically
put<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.299> on<00:02:38.450> I'm<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.079> put<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.319> on<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
put it on I'm going to put it on the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.860 
put it on I'm going to put it on the
last<00:02:39.769> hook<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.849> that<00:02:40.879> it's<00:02:41.120> firm

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
last hook so that it's firm

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.770 
last hook so that it's firm
but<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:42.680> over<00:02:43.280> time<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:44.000> may<00:02:44.239> want<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.510> put<00:02:44.690> it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
but then over time I may want to put it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.880 
but then over time I may want to put it
on<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.680> closest<00:02:46.160> exact<00:02:46.640> aren't<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
on the closest exact aren't it here and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.610 
on the closest exact aren't it here and
then<00:02:49.120> slip<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.150> lean<00:02:51.019> over

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
then slip it lean over

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.349 
then slip it lean over
oh<00:02:51.890> oh<00:02:52.190> you're<00:02:52.640> doing<00:02:52.849> they're<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> go
