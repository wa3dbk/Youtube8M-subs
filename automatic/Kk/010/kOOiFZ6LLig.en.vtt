00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
my reviews for Dragon Ball Kai I had

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.749 
my reviews for Dragon Ball Kai I had
started<00:01:30.020> them<00:01:30.140> on<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.350> Buu<00:01:30.470> saga<00:01:30.740> started<00:01:31.069> but

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.789 
started them on the Buu saga started but
I<00:01:32.000> stopped<00:01:32.479> doing<00:01:32.600> them<00:01:32.840> on<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.080> weekly<00:01:33.440> basis

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
I stopped doing them on a weekly basis

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.499 
I stopped doing them on a weekly basis
because<00:01:33.979> each<00:01:34.310> episode<00:01:34.789> is<00:01:34.880> pretty<00:01:35.119> short

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
because each episode is pretty short

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.389 
because each episode is pretty short

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
think about it from from today's

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.420 
think about it from from today's
perspective<00:05:27.020> or<00:05:27.469> from<00:05:27.500> later<00:05:27.800> on<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.129> series

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
perspective or from later on the series

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.390 
perspective or from later on the series
in<00:05:28.819> reality<00:05:29.330> Goku<00:05:30.289> could<00:05:30.560> have<00:05:30.860> gone<00:05:31.009> super

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
in reality Goku could have gone super

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.159 
in reality Goku could have gone super
saiyan<00:05:31.610> 3<00:05:31.699> there<00:05:32.120> if<00:05:32.360> he<00:05:32.509> wanted<00:05:32.930> to

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
saiyan 3 there if he wanted to

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.950 
saiyan 3 there if he wanted to
and<00:05:33.500> wipe<00:05:34.159> the<00:05:34.310> floor<00:05:34.520> with<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.789> cheetah<00:05:35.000> but<00:05:35.629> I

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
and wipe the floor with a cheetah but I

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.480 
and wipe the floor with a cheetah but I
think<00:05:36.409> he<00:05:36.500> was<00:05:36.620> trying<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.889> keep<00:05:37.009> his<00:05:37.159> energy

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
think he was trying to keep his energy

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.830 
think he was trying to keep his energy
down<00:05:37.610> because<00:05:37.940> he<00:05:38.030> thought<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.659> know

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
down because he thought that you know

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.950 
down because he thought that you know
the<00:05:39.800> Buu<00:05:40.340> would<00:05:40.610> be<00:05:40.729> able<00:05:40.819> to<00:05:40.940> absorb<00:05:41.300> it<00:05:41.569> Bobby

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
the Buu would be able to absorb it Bobby

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.480 
the Buu would be able to absorb it Bobby
would<00:05:42.229> be<00:05:42.349> able<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.590> absorb<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:43.219> know<00:05:43.310> and

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
would be able to absorb you know and

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.950 
would be able to absorb you know and
Super<00:05:43.879> Saiyan<00:05:44.030> level<00:05:44.270> 3<00:05:44.419> puts<00:05:44.629> up<00:05:44.719> so<00:05:44.840> much

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
Super Saiyan level 3 puts up so much

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.080 
Super Saiyan level 3 puts up so much
energy<00:05:45.139> it's<00:05:45.469> unreal<00:05:45.860> he<00:05:46.550> probably<00:05:46.789> didn't

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
energy it's unreal he probably didn't

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.330 
energy it's unreal he probably didn't
think<00:05:47.120> that<00:05:47.509> Vegeta<00:05:48.139> would<00:05:48.440> be<00:05:48.650> at<00:05:48.889> that<00:05:49.159> kind

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
think that Vegeta would be at that kind

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.680 
think that Vegeta would be at that kind
of<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.520> level<00:05:49.819> to<00:05:49.969> be<00:05:50.090> able<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.270> give<00:05:50.389> him<00:05:50.509> that

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
of a level to be able to give him that

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.959 
of a level to be able to give him that
good<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.990> match<00:05:51.199> in<00:05:51.620> Super<00:05:52.219> Saiyan<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:52.610> form

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
good of a match in Super Saiyan to form

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.869 
good of a match in Super Saiyan to form
and<00:05:54.009> also<00:05:55.009> he<00:05:55.279> didn't<00:05:55.430> want<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.580> waste<00:05:55.729> his

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:55.879

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.850 
and also he didn't want to waste his
time<00:05:56.090> because<00:05:56.360> we<00:05:56.569> find<00:05:56.779> out<00:05:56.960> later<00:05:57.110> when<00:05:57.740> he
