00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Berlin Brandenburg Gate 9 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 wet and cold weather 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.970
 The American photographer Bob Perry 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 is preparing for a shooting in front of a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.660
 to take a special shooting with yourself 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.970
 even a shooting in the pink tutu he is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.490
 small a little underestimated anymore 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.130
 the youngest it is not the first 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.820
 and it will not be the last photo of this 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.070
 art his 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 the brandenburger tor is just one of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.769
 many unusual places where 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.020
 bob out and put on the tutu 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.739
 for him, germany is in full 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.739
 special place 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.300
 It seems as if it's really happening 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.860
 going 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.719
 we have so much support in the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 but especially in the whole world 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.309
 Germany is gigantic here 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.930
 It is the largest online fanbase 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.930
 that is just oversaturated 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.270
 American East Coast since around ten 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.570
 the home of bob and his wife 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.070
 Linda already had the couple in 1986 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.500
 got to know and love each other 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.450
 Six months after moving to the coast 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.390
 then the shocking diagnosis for 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.310
 Countries breast cancer as they diagnose 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.770
 got sat with me a kind 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.380
 self-therapy 1 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.550
 I had to go out like a runner of 8 may 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.520
 I want to run free my head 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.990
 I went out and shot photos of photos of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.690
 myself and took these pictures and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.430
 that in the most unusual places bob 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.040
 photographed himself in pink 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.960
 tutu in the middle of new york or on one 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.750
 Field in winter lying on a 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.320
 Parking or hanging on a palm 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.930
 childish curious carefree open of 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.649
 These photos made Linda smile 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.509
 in the face 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.450
 helped her with the disease better 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.789
 to cope if I'm not there 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.190
 I wanted to be able to participate and that 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.690
 goes with e mail for example and the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.929
 photos made me laugh 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.360
 i was better off the photos of bob im 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.459
 pink tutu not only helped countries 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.680
 They took her to the treatment and 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.950
 Other patients also fell 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.480
 to bob and his team 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.819
 At that point I knew that too 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.150
 make others happy and get them out of the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.670
 could bring reality that was the moment 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.390
 When I said we should get this one 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.160
 photos done do something said 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.650
 besides doing project for his wife 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.440
 linda, the carry foundation was created 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.220
 photos should help money for 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.620
 breast cancer patients together 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.860
 a goal with not just boxing photos 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.599
 but also the internet was helpful 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.260
 Participate and millions of people 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.870
 touch in the secondary cycle 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.980
 it was crazy coming from everywhere 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.900
 interview requests if we like this 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.799
 technology would not have had it 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.799
 not grown so fast 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.400
 the power of sharing on the internet 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.709
 also highlights a tv spot 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.540
 telekom of recently bob and leenders 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.049
 history offers another platform 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.370
 and the concern of both promotes whether 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.440
 television or internet 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.060
 bob and leender's story has hers 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.090
 found way to the people 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.160
 to europe to germany the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.410
 unusual way to get into the scene 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.410
 It was also very successful in Berlin 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.530
 the match that the tutu project 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.049
 experiencing it all at the same time is an incentive 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.110
 for bob and countries not only in the fight 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.120
 against the breast cancer ddr I say 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.189
 me the situation is just like her 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.319
 the question is how am I going with it now 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.299
 to the bob and I have considered 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.849
 how we want to shape our lives 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.299
 It is good to think positive and with 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:53.709
 a smile to fight the pain 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.390
 What is it that distracts us? 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.260
 is not my cancer but ours 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.359
 to live life 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.709
 We get up in the morning and think 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.739
 what our goals are 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.790
 Cancer is a part of life though 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.790
 not the whole life 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:17.150
 he is just a good place and blind 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.579
 the pink jersey 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.740
 Such love stories only writes 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.740
 the life itself 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.740
