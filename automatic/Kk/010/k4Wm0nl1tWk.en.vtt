running into this amp at the moment with

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.219

all the settings flat and it sounds

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.130 
all the settings flat and it sounds
without<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.589> preamp<00:01:05.009> it<00:01:05.159> sounds<00:01:05.840> almost<00:01:06.840> as

without a preamp it sounds almost as

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
without a preamp it sounds almost as
good<00:01:07.289> as<00:01:07.440> anything<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> I've<00:01:08.100> ever<00:01:08.280> heard

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
good as anything that I've ever heard

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510 
good as anything that I've ever heard
you<00:01:09.539> know<00:01:09.660> without<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:09.960> preamp<00:01:10.410> but<00:01:11.100> what's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you know without a preamp but what's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.889 
you know without a preamp but what's
really<00:01:11.670> nice<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.030> he's<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.539> some<00:01:12.750> little

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
really nice is he's got some little

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.450 
really nice is he's got some little
choices<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.009> have<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.160> bright

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
choices here you can have a bright

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.150 
choices here you can have a bright
switch<00:01:14.810> right<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.590> bright<00:01:16.830> switch

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
switch right here the bright switch

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:30.050 
switch right here the bright switch
allows<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.940> get<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> sparkle

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.090 

much<00:01:31.060> more<00:01:31.270> than<00:01:31.360> I<00:01:31.600> end<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.650> other<00:01:32.740> thing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
much more than I end the other thing

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.340 
much more than I end the other thing
note<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:34.510> I<00:01:34.540> like<00:01:34.780> about<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.229> it's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
note that that I like about it is it's

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.670 
note that that I like about it is it's
got<00:01:35.470> bass<00:01:35.740> treble<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:37.110> mids<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.530> can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
got bass treble and mids that you can

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.070 
got bass treble and mids that you can
adjust<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.490> would<00:01:39.700> probably<00:01:39.909> for<00:01:40.659> my<00:01:40.780> taste

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
adjust so I would probably for my taste

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.290 
adjust so I would probably for my taste
put<00:01:41.860> on<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.130> bright<00:01:42.310> switch<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.940> take<00:01:43.060> some

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
put on the bright switch and take some

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.180 
put on the bright switch and take some
of<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.450> mids<00:01:43.659> down<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.650> I'm<00:01:44.740> getting<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.040> little

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
of the mids down so I'm getting a little

00:01:45.190 --> 00:02:01.179 
of the mids down so I'm getting a little
less<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.550> it

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.260 

an<00:02:01.609> idea<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.450> what<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:02.810> really<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.530> doing

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
an idea of what this really is doing

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.809 
an idea of what this really is doing
what<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.359> isn't<00:02:05.509> doing<00:02:05.990> probably<00:02:06.859> better<00:02:07.069> I'll

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
what it isn't doing probably better I'll

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.560 
what it isn't doing probably better I'll
turn<00:02:07.999> the<00:02:08.090> volume<00:02:08.209> all<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.750> way<00:02:08.869> off

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.970 

it's<00:02:15.570> very<00:02:15.960> natural<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.560> mean<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.800> doesn't

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it's very natural I mean it doesn't

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.950 
it's very natural I mean it doesn't
really<00:02:17.430> color<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.970> tone<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.210> much<00:02:18.600> that's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
really color the tone that much that's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:34.880 
really color the tone that much that's
what<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.350> about<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:33.320> probably<00:02:34.320> an<00:02:34.530> ideal

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
what I like about it probably an ideal

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740 
what I like about it probably an ideal
for<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.310> particular<00:02:35.610> guitar<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.390> ideal

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
for this particular guitar an ideal

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:58.830 
for this particular guitar an ideal
Center

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.809 

well<00:02:59.840> there's<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.140> different<00:03:00.530> guitar<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
well there's a different guitar for the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.300 
well there's a different guitar for the
Humphrey<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:03.530> really<00:03:03.860> designed<00:03:04.040> for

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
Humphrey it's really designed for

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.610 
Humphrey it's really designed for
acoustics<00:03:04.819> but<00:03:04.910> he's<00:03:05.030> built<00:03:05.300> in<00:03:05.450> some<00:03:06.319> things

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
acoustics but he's built in some things

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620 
acoustics but he's built in some things
that<00:03:06.860> are<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.400> think<00:03:07.760> are<00:03:07.970> great<00:03:08.180> for<00:03:08.420> jazz

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
that are I think are great for jazz

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
switch down it takes the horn out of the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.670 
switch down it takes the horn out of the
mix<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.870> now<00:03:41.989> we're<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.260> running<00:03:42.560> through

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
mix and now we're just running through

00:03:42.680 --> 00:04:00.910 
mix and now we're just running through
the<00:03:42.769> 15-inch<00:03:43.250> speaker<00:03:59.410> then<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.709> further

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
the 15-inch speaker then you can further

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.069 
the 15-inch speaker then you can further
take<00:04:01.850> out<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.209> brightness<00:04:02.450> if<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.840> want<00:04:02.989> with

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
take out the brightness if you want with

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:14.470 
take out the brightness if you want with
a<00:04:03.109> bright<00:04:03.470> switch<00:04:03.769> right<00:04:04.069> here<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:14.150> might<00:04:14.359> be

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
a bright switch right here this might be

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.729 
a bright switch right here this might be
nice<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.840> were<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.170> middle<00:04:15.440> pickup

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
nice if you were in the middle pickup

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.300 
nice if you were in the middle pickup
setting

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.830 

the<00:04:22.669> other<00:04:22.820> thing<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.270> did<00:04:23.389> for<00:04:23.750> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
the other thing that I did for the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.020 
the other thing that I did for the
acoustic<00:04:24.080> was<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.590> took<00:04:24.650> out<00:04:24.949> the<00:04:25.100> mids<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.729> we

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
acoustic was I took out the mids and we

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.820 
acoustic was I took out the mids and we
can<00:04:26.180> put<00:04:26.330> those<00:04:26.449> back<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:27.229> for<00:04:27.740> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
can put those back in now for the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:05:03.219 
can put those back in now for the
electric<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.729> just<00:04:28.940> said<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.240> a<00:05:02.229> pretty

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
electric it just said it a pretty

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.010 
electric it just said it a pretty
versatile<00:05:03.680> amp<00:05:03.949> I<00:05:04.610> think<00:05:05.419> it<00:05:05.510> was<00:05:05.630> an<00:05:05.780> acoustic

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
versatile amp I think it was an acoustic

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.080 
versatile amp I think it was an acoustic
amp<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.680> think<00:05:06.889> for<00:05:07.070> a<00:05:07.100> jazz<00:05:07.370> player<00:05:07.850> it

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
amp but I think for a jazz player it

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.129 
amp but I think for a jazz player it
would<00:05:08.389> be<00:05:08.479> perfect

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
would be perfect

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.520 
would be perfect
so<00:05:10.070> here's<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.310> completely<00:05:10.729> different<00:05:11.150> kind<00:05:11.330> of

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
so here's a completely different kind of

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.300 
so here's a completely different kind of
instrument<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.590> might<00:05:12.740> want<00:05:12.919> to<00:05:12.949> use<00:05:13.099> in<00:05:13.280> a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
instrument you might want to use in a

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.689 
instrument you might want to use in a
humphrey<00:05:13.639> amp<00:05:13.849> it's<00:05:14.650> this<00:05:15.650> instrument<00:05:16.550> is

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
humphrey amp it's this instrument is

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.820 
humphrey amp it's this instrument is
sort<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.479> supposed<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.080> be<00:05:18.229> a<00:05:18.260> resonator

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
sort of supposed to be a resonator

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.969 
sort of supposed to be a resonator
guitar<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:19.639> electric<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.419> acoustic<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.590> so

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
guitar but electric and acoustic and so

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.050 
guitar but electric and acoustic and so
I'm<00:05:22.070> going<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.250> show<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.729> is<00:05:22.910> the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
I'm going to show you this is the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:40.950 
I'm going to show you this is the
electric<00:05:23.810> pickup

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.110 

so<00:05:41.960> now<00:05:42.169> that's<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.889> straight<00:05:43.249> on<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.550> on

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
so now that's just straight on the on

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.790 
so now that's just straight on the on
the<00:05:44.330> electric<00:05:44.749> pickup<00:05:45.020> but<00:05:45.289> if<00:05:45.409> you<00:05:45.499> wanted<00:05:45.710> to

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
the electric pickup but if you wanted to

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.499 
the electric pickup but if you wanted to
get<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:45.919> little<00:05:46.069> more<00:05:46.159> acoustic<00:05:46.460> sound<00:05:46.939> you<00:05:47.360> can

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
get a little more acoustic sound you can

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.749 
get a little more acoustic sound you can
dial<00:05:47.749> in<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.080> acoustic<00:05:48.319> pickup<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:49.610> that's

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
dial in the acoustic pickup and that's

00:05:49.759 --> 00:06:00.119 
dial in the acoustic pickup and that's
where<00:05:49.969> this<00:05:50.090> amp<00:05:50.360> comes<00:05:50.659> in<00:05:50.810> really<00:05:50.960> handy

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:18.070 

you

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:35.270 

now<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.110> can<00:06:19.470> also<00:06:19.620> kick<00:06:19.980> in<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.220> horn<00:06:34.280> probably

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
now I can also kick in the horn probably

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.040 
now I can also kick in the horn probably
use<00:06:35.400> the<00:06:35.520> horn<00:06:35.790> and<00:06:36.330> you<00:06:36.420> might<00:06:36.540> even<00:06:36.690> kick<00:06:36.930> in

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
use the horn and you might even kick in

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.350 
use the horn and you might even kick in
the<00:06:37.170> bright<00:06:37.410> switch<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:38.730> then<00:06:38.940> you<00:06:38.970> can<00:06:39.210> turn

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
the bright switch and then you can turn

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:57.250 
the bright switch and then you can turn
the<00:06:39.420> treble<00:06:39.930> down<00:06:40.110> on<00:06:40.320> the

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260 

so<00:06:58.260> it's<00:06:58.590> got<00:06:58.740> a<00:06:58.770> lot<00:06:58.980> of<00:06:59.010> different<00:06:59.460> uses<00:07:00.090> and

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
so it's got a lot of different uses and

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.090 
so it's got a lot of different uses and
on<00:07:00.660> top<00:07:00.930> of<00:07:01.140> that<00:07:01.260> on<00:07:01.560> top<00:07:01.590> of<00:07:01.860> all<00:07:01.950> these

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
on top of that on top of all these

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.520 
on top of that on top of all these
different<00:07:02.310> uses<00:07:02.820> that<00:07:03.300> you<00:07:03.540> could<00:07:03.720> put<00:07:04.380> this

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
different uses that you could put this

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.160 
different uses that you could put this
in<00:07:04.590> the<00:07:04.710> app<00:07:04.800> -<00:07:05.130> it's<00:07:06.000> a<00:07:06.150> beautiful<00:07:06.480> cabinet<00:07:07.080> it

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170 
in the app - it's a beautiful cabinet it

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.140 
in the app - it's a beautiful cabinet it
makes<00:07:07.410> them<00:07:07.560> in<00:07:07.650> different<00:07:07.800> hardwoods<00:07:08.400> you

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
makes them in different hardwoods you

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.520 
makes them in different hardwoods you
could<00:07:09.270> probably<00:07:09.390> get<00:07:09.630> one<00:07:09.780> to<00:07:09.930> match<00:07:10.140> your<00:07:10.500> own

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
could probably get one to match your own

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.740 
could probably get one to match your own
guitar<00:07:10.950> I<00:07:11.370> don't<00:07:11.550> know<00:07:11.610> for<00:07:11.940> sure<00:07:11.970> but<00:07:12.300> this

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
guitar I don't know for sure but this

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.680 
guitar I don't know for sure but this
one<00:07:12.960> is<00:07:13.140> in<00:07:13.770> a<00:07:13.890> walnut<00:07:14.130> and<00:07:14.580> he<00:07:15.150> does<00:07:15.330> one<00:07:15.540> in

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
one is in a walnut and he does one in

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.910 
one is in a walnut and he does one in
different<00:07:16.050> colors<00:07:16.290> they<00:07:16.380> just<00:07:16.560> look<00:07:16.710> great

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920 
different colors they just look great

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.040 
different colors they just look great
sitting<00:07:17.250> in<00:07:17.490> the<00:07:17.580> living<00:07:17.790> room<00:07:17.970> -<00:07:18.210> so<00:07:18.480> I<00:07:18.840> think

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
sitting in the living room - so I think

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.800 
sitting in the living room - so I think
it's<00:07:19.290> a<00:07:19.350> cool<00:07:19.530> amp
