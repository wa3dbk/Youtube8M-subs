00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.629
 league 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.369
 For Christmas I cook a four 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.350
 This will be a bit of a menu 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.570
 international mix i am myself 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.400
 half-Italian half-americans inside 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.260
 and whenever I was in the USA and me 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.060
 my mother was able to sprint Italian 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.650
 cooking then I felt closer to her 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.780
 or if I were in Germany 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.670
 America we missed then I have the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.309
 my father cooked and has dishes 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.010
 I felt empty and so is cooking 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.210
 so no one has become a retreat for me 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.950
 As an appetizer, I'm doing a lot 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.010
 traditional italian dish 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.200
 Passat elli means noodles are out 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.670
 Semmelbrösel eggs and parmesan cheese 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.559
 and they are becoming more and more 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.559
 festive days served in beef broth 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.260
 We start with 250 grams of breadcrumbs 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.500
 quite unusual, the same amount 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.860
 grated parmesan 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 that will be well mixed 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.820
 then I take a bit of nutmeg 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 not too much 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.790
 and then you can do it a bit 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.430
 lemon peel 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.869
 whether you are just nutmeg or just 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.670
 Lemon takes that is a bit one 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.110
 regional thing within the region 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.880
 there are differences but then stop 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.350
 both together taste great too 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.930
 and that's my favorite 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:46.040
 then comes a hollow in the middle and 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:49.009
 then I break the eggs in there and 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.229
 then I use my hands and start 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.630
 just to the eggs with the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.789
 breadcrumbs and cheese to mix 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 this can also be done with the fork 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.990
 but it fits then you do actually 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.670
 always with hand you have better 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.830
 Feeling so the dough is nice now 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.310
 mix it very tight that's right 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.000
 so now we are looking forward to a ball like this 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.290
 Well it works and leave the here at the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.290
 bowl rest for a few minutes 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.350
 so the dough now has five minutes fine 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.330
 Now we can make the pasta telli 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.790
 we just need a whole 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.470
 normal potato squeeze and then 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.850
 Let's just take the dough I report 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.610
 it's now a two because it 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.780
 pretty big tonmeister in and out 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.780
 just start squeezing 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.379
 good if you have someone with muscles in the house 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.860
 to have 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:59.200
 that is very simple work 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.840
 if they are about 4 inches long once 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.260
 cut and then just continue 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.900
 press the condition 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.549
 I have already made a broth for it 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.189
 I have some soup meat 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.470
 taken vegetables and onions 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.480
 carrot some celery and have them 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.459
 very long at very low 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.230
 simmer to a flame 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.609
 you do the pasta tallinn in the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.200
 boiling brühl rhein and then you have to 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.940
 Just wait until you see it 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.739
 came up and then they are 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.599
 already done that is with itself 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.370
 made fits a very fast 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.459
 It should be a matter of a few minutes 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.459
 last
