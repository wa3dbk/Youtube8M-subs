00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you are how good I am in this case

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.030 
you are how good I am in this case
that's<00:00:31.199> not<00:00:31.470> good<00:00:31.679> that's<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.820> good<00:00:33.770> no<00:00:34.770> prize

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
that's not good that's not good no prize

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.139 
that's not good that's not good no prize
no<00:00:36.030> prize<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> landed<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> gas

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
no prize there I landed right in the gas

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.180 
no prize there I landed right in the gas
so<00:00:39.149> I'm<00:00:39.390> gonna<00:00:39.570> keep<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
so I'm gonna keep going for it here and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.850 
so I'm gonna keep going for it here and
see<00:00:42.120> how<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:44.239> ok<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.780> midair<00:00:49.020> balance<00:00:49.649> is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
see how I do ok so the midair balance is

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
see how I do ok so the midair balance is
crucial<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> bike<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.050> keeps<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
crucial it's the bike that keeps you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.630 
crucial it's the bike that keeps you
from<00:00:52.800> landing<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> gas<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.460> that's<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
from landing in the gas so that's the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
from landing in the gas so that's the
key<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.510> staying<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.440> bike<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.829> long

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
key is like staying on your bike as long

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
key is like staying on your bike as long
as<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.640> last<00:00:59.940> jump<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:01.109> gotta

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
as you can in this last jump you gotta

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
as you can in this last jump you gotta
jump<00:01:01.559> over<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:02.100> gas<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.660> bike

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
jump over some gas there if your bike

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
jump over some gas there if your bike
still<00:01:04.140> survives<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.040> last<00:01:05.339> jump<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
still survives that last jump then you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.570 
still survives that last jump then you
can<00:01:06.299> ride<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.930> victory<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> where

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
can ride it to victory and this is where

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
can ride it to victory and this is where
the<00:01:08.760> bike<00:01:08.939> appears<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> price<00:01:10.140> bubble

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
