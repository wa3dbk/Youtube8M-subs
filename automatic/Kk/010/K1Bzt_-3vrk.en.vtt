 Meat grinder through the middle slice 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.710

 Do you take the massa and 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.150
 Leave it a second time 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.540

 her twice the hole then leaves short 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.800
 a bit of baking powder is about son 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.040
 Persons three quarters of it 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.070
 it was now with this mass 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.720

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.430

 vegetable leipzig minced me 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 would the little ones before you do yourself 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.060
 because they are crisper than cool though 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.180
 I think they are always the best 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.180
 even so that made then look 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.049

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.879
 Once the oil is always solid 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.170
 you can do that too if you are the first 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.599
 Sometimes I want to expire or flee 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.209
 then I would prefer to look first of all 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.220

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.190
