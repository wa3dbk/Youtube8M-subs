00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 hello and welcome here with 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.729
 my foot constantly michael frieser for 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.789
 you and I have all found cash 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.979
 your skills 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.059
 I've stumbled over it many times already 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.469
 I always wondered what is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.909
 if then somehow just again 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.189
 Run over 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.110
 Now I tell myself there are two variants 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 I have the fruits first 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 taken away there is still an acidic 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 Variations so far is passing by 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.700
 brÃ¼hl pack writes me 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.289
 a comment or another one 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.210
 Review of then we want to do that 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.190
 because it likes me too 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.369
 interested in being me 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.630
 and am surprised accordingly 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.520
 there are some problems we find here as well 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.740
 all over the area and the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.270
 try 5x we've got it going 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.539
 also thinks bigger bugs have here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.250
 specified 100 grams included and 82 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:48.780
 calories are probably what 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 robert icing sugar it is quite good 404 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 calories to 100 grams small underneath 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.399
 the small pack here has 109 80 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.190
 calories are going on there then we will do 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.349
 We'll have fed 42 here 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:07.709
 saturated fatty acids 2.3 km of it 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:11.480
 we have carbohydrates 90 grams 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:15.870
 it's neatly 89 grams of sugar 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.430
 very neat so absolutely pack 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.700
 wise it should not necessarily testify 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.830
 eat 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.120
 with what tastes good, we have a problem 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.650
 already seen in the metro video 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.060
 very nice many different colors 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.810
 just try orange and purple 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.810
 or what it should be 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.940
 I think there was already something like that 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.390
 we are a bit strange 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 aftertaste 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.220
 I do not know anything about the night market 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.519
 it's good 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:15.299
 fruity what you call right 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.299
 tastes very chemical 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.019
 aftertaste interesting very much 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.470
 interesting to be honest i can 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.630
 It does not exactly define what it is 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.540
 or represent Germany only one 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.459
 but the whole thing I have ever 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.410
 seen from only german brand 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.410
 is already a while ago me 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.880
 've just tasted good since 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.829
 small part very maybe still knows 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.950
 someone of you kindly writes the 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.299
 comments that would be great 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.030
 There was something of the German market 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.790
 is there just as hard in there as well ? 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.230
 Trance or core just has a bit 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.239
 tasted different but very much 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.400
 played great and I mean it 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:01.410
 these tablets have been a little bit bigger 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:05.530
 I say that happens to be great 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.829
 Consistency is cool copied at the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.829
 aftertaste 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.810
 very bad but not extreme 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.790
 So I have time after the pack 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.660
 wish with absolutely controlled, I believe 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.360
 believe spanier on 23 days on that should 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.130
 absolutely enough interesting 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.590
 product in any case but it would be 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.660
 So technically I see others 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.550
 believe it was a german who of the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.290
 there was and sacred on everyone 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.830
 If a higher score is earned here 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.750
 two points writes about the acidic 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 I want to see where I also hope 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.320
 let's hope for two more spoons of this 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.660
 5 is enough taste for it is 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.980
 Crash is violent to extreme 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.320
 do not eat it is just simple 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.630
 there is a better gummi bear to 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.340
 example, anything else is a great 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.810
 alternative market might also like times 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.080
 try and write me like he did 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.480
 finds finds and maybe you will find 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.920
 just a little bit I know 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.440
 too traditional I do not know 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.630
 maybe for everything but now 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.430
 really quite a flesh water to 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.720
 Taste in the mouth together I come 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.210
 say thank you for watching 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.210
 michael frieser csu then it's good
