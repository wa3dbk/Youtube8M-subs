this Co it's not in the owner's manual

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.140 
this Co it's not in the owner's manual
I<00:00:10.650> tried<00:00:10.950> looking<00:00:11.070> at<00:00:11.340> online<00:00:11.490> kind<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.969> find

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
I tried looking at online kind of find

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.759 
I tried looking at online kind of find
out<00:00:12.269> there<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> figured<00:00:13.230> out<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.650> was

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
out there but I figured out it was

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.430 
out there but I figured out it was
because<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.340> dial<00:00:14.580> that's<00:00:14.820> bad

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
because of the dial that's bad

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.929 
because of the dial that's bad
thermostats<00:00:16.440> dial<00:00:19.279> this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.699> Dow

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
thermostats dial this is how the Dow

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.939 
thermostats dial this is how the Dow
looks<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> legit<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.650> if<00:00:22.830> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
looks like this is a legit one if you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.750 
looks like this is a legit one if you
want<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.220> spend<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.900> $24<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.430> believe<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760

itself this is a replacement now if you
get<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> soldering<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
get a soldering all you have to do is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
get a soldering all you have to do is
tear<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> other<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> put<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.809> one

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
tear out the other one and put this one

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.040 
tear out the other one and put this one
in<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.430> only<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.820> 79<00:00:51.329> cents<00:00:51.809> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
in there this is only about 79 cents so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.689 
in there this is only about 79 cents so
obviously<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> ways<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> lot<00:00:53.160> cheaper<00:00:53.430> but

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
obviously this ways a lot cheaper but

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
obviously this ways a lot cheaper but
you<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.149> getting<00:00:54.300> soldering<00:00:54.770> if<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you have to be getting soldering if you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.720 
you have to be getting soldering if you
want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> route<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:58.430> first<00:00:59.430> step<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
want to go this route so first step is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.060 
want to go this route so first step is
to<00:01:00.149> definitely<00:01:00.840> unplug<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> power<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
to definitely unplug the power so you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.950 
to definitely unplug the power so you
don't<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.489> electrocuted<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:05.750> behind<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
don't get electrocuted right behind the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.670 
don't get electrocuted right behind the
dryer<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.340> screws<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.450> seven<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
dryer there are two screws a seven I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
dryer there are two screws a seven I
think<00:01:10.830> eight<00:01:11.189> mill<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:12.180> Phillip<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.670> get

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
think eight mill or Phillip and you get

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.370 
think eight mill or Phillip and you get
closer<00:01:15.900> look<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> go

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.980 

to<00:01:21.310> screw<00:01:21.640> back<00:01:21.850> here<00:01:22.119> in<00:01:22.240> ten<00:01:22.450> minutes<00:01:22.479> where

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
to screw back here in ten minutes where

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.550 
to screw back here in ten minutes where
Philips<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.360> Philips<00:01:25.840> wrapping<00:01:26.200> right<00:01:26.320> here

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
Philips and Philips wrapping right here

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.560 
Philips and Philips wrapping right here
should<00:01:27.189> come<00:01:27.340> right<00:01:27.490> off<00:01:27.549> okay<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:31.299> next<00:01:31.479> step

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
should come right off okay the next step

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.560 
should come right off okay the next step
is<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.899> cover<00:01:32.259> this<00:01:32.920> top<00:01:33.159> cover<00:01:33.399> right<00:01:33.670> here<00:01:33.700> has

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
is a cover this top cover right here has
