and<00:01:08.490> technology<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.110> essentially<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and technology and essentially what the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
and technology and essentially what the
building<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.970> sort<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
building is really was to sort of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.039 
building is really was to sort of
analyze<00:01:13.220> which<00:01:14.220> qualities<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.270> building<00:01:15.900> needs

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
analyze which qualities a building needs

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
analyze which qualities a building needs
to<00:01:16.110> provide<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.310> each<00:01:17.490> quality<00:01:18.000> he<00:01:18.180> would

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to provide and for each quality he would

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
to provide and for each quality he would
design<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> specific<00:01:18.990> machine<00:01:19.729> basically<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
design a specific machine basically we

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330 
design a specific machine basically we
need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.330> able<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.869> inside<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.189> we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
need to be able to see inside so we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
need to be able to see inside so we
designed<00:01:23.700> electric<00:01:24.210> lights<00:01:24.420> making<00:01:24.869> us

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
designed electric lights making us

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950 
designed electric lights making us
independent<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> windows<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:27.210> need<00:01:27.390> fresh

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
independent of the windows we need fresh

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
independent of the windows we need fresh
air<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.619> he<00:01:28.710> designed<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> mechanical

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
air so he designed the mechanical

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
air so he designed the mechanical
ventilation<00:01:30.240> making<00:01:31.079> us<00:01:31.229> independent<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
ventilation making us independent of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.130 
ventilation making us independent of
opening<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> windows<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.960> need

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
opening the windows and we need

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
opening the windows and we need
comfortable<00:01:35.040> temperature<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.790> designed

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
comfortable temperature so he designed

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.469 
comfortable temperature so he designed
central<00:01:36.930> heating<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.350> air-conditioning

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
central heating and air-conditioning

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.069 
central heating and air-conditioning
making<00:01:39.479> us<00:01:39.570> independent<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:41.450> solar<00:01:42.450> heat<00:01:42.780> or

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
making us independent of solar heat or

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.270 
making us independent of solar heat or
the<00:01:43.470> figures<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> wall<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.340> even<00:01:44.579> shade<00:01:45.200> so

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the figures of the wall or even shade so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
the figures of the wall or even shade so
gradually<00:01:47.280> modern<00:01:48.180> architecture<00:01:48.840> evolved

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
gradually modern architecture evolved

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.030 
gradually modern architecture evolved
into<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.590> sort<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.540> monolith<00:01:51.540> void<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.740> any

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
into this sort of monolith void of any

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.760 
into this sort of monolith void of any
kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> quality<00:01:53.579> tube<00:01:54.509> fit<00:01:54.869> by<00:01:55.170> an<00:01:55.320> army<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
kind of quality tube fit by an army of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
kind of quality tube fit by an army of
machines<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> gradually<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.570> world<00:02:00.810> got

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
machines and gradually the the world got

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590 
machines and gradually the the world got
populated<00:02:01.619> by<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.799> sort<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.159> boring<00:02:03.030> boxes

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
populated by these sort of boring boxes

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.999 
populated by these sort of boring boxes
with<00:02:04.500> big<00:02:04.740> energy<00:02:05.250> bills<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.890> we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
with big energy bills so when when we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.660 
with big energy bills so when when we
were<00:02:08.129> recently<00:02:08.550> asked<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:11.280> design<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
were recently asked to to design a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.350 
were recently asked to to design a
high-rise<00:02:12.830> 50%<00:02:13.830> housing<00:02:14.250> 50%<00:02:14.849> office

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
high-rise 50% housing 50% office

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940 
high-rise 50% housing 50% office
we<00:02:15.959> asked<00:02:16.290> ourselves<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.800> could

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
we asked ourselves that we could

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.400 
we asked ourselves that we could
actually<00:02:17.099> reverse<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.970> tendency<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.690> use

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
actually reverse this tendency and use

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.770 
actually reverse this tendency and use
contemporary<00:02:20.069> intelligence<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.360> move<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
contemporary intelligence to move the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
qualities back into the architecture and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.510 
qualities back into the architecture and
away<00:02:24.750> from<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.650> Machine<00:02:25.950> room<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.400> the

away from the the Machine room in the
basement<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.440> asked<00:02:28.650> ourselves<00:02:28.800> first<00:02:29.760> of

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
basement so we asked ourselves first of

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.630 
basement so we asked ourselves first of
all<00:02:32.480> offices<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:34.200> spend<00:02:34.769> energy<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.069> cooling

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
all offices they spend energy on cooling

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.809 
all offices they spend energy on cooling
and<00:02:35.849> they<00:02:36.390> spend<00:02:36.660> energy<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.930> electric<00:02:37.470> lights

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
and they spend energy on electric lights

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.150 
and they spend energy on electric lights
so<00:02:38.819> how<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.269> minimize<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.950> need<00:02:41.129> for

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
so how can you minimize the need for

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.729 
so how can you minimize the need for
cooling<00:02:41.700> while<00:02:42.269> maximizing<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.349> abundance

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
cooling while maximizing the abundance

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.729 
cooling while maximizing the abundance
of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.310> daylight<00:02:44.930> well<00:02:45.930> first<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.349> all<00:02:46.440> in

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
of the of daylight well first of all in

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.430 
of the of daylight well first of all in
in<00:02:47.340> Denmark<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> Sun<00:02:48.690> rises<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
in Denmark is that the Sun rises in the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.790 
in Denmark is that the Sun rises in the
East<00:02:50.280> goes<00:02:51.000> over<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> south<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.019> down<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
East goes over the south and down in the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.130 
East goes over the south and down in the
West<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.610> Spanish<00:02:56.940> way<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.269> Orion

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
West and so the Spanish way of Orion

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.690 
West and so the Spanish way of Orion
thing<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.379> building<00:02:58.680> would<00:02:58.800> be<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.670> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
thing the building would be to have a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.430 
thing the building would be to have a
North<00:02:59.940> facing<00:03:00.330> facade<00:03:00.690> completely<00:03:01.170> free<00:03:01.409> of

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
North facing facade completely free of

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.670 
North facing facade completely free of
sunshine<00:03:02.129> but<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> abundant<00:03:04.019> diffused

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
sunshine but with a abundant diffused

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.640 
sunshine but with a abundant diffused
daylight<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.450> South<00:03:06.659> facade<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.319> is

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
daylight and the South facade that is

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
daylight and the South facade that is
actually<00:03:08.040> gonna<00:03:08.159> be<00:03:08.250> exposed<00:03:08.760> most<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.330> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
actually gonna be exposed most of the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330 
actually gonna be exposed most of the
day<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.840> Sun<00:03:10.050> but<00:03:10.709> from<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.010> highest

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
day to the Sun but from the highest

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.369 
day to the Sun but from the highest
angle<00:03:11.790> where<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.090> easiest<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:13.140> rid<00:03:13.319> of

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
angle where it's easiest to get rid of

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.430 
angle where it's easiest to get rid of
it<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.840> answer<00:03:16.050> self

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
it so the answer self

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
it so the answer self
since<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.310> only<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> summer<00:03:18.030> months

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
since it's only in the summer months

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
since it's only in the summer months
that<00:03:18.720> there's<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> risk<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.800> overheating<00:03:20.129> in<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
that there's a risk of overheating in a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.039 
that there's a risk of overheating in a
Danish<00:03:21.420> workplace<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.720> maximum

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
Danish workplace so and the maximum

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.399 
Danish workplace so and the maximum
angle<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.769> Sun<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.220> 57<00:03:27.030> degrees<00:03:27.080> so<00:03:28.080> if<00:03:28.260> we

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
angle of the Sun is 57 degrees so if we

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.490 
angle of the Sun is 57 degrees so if we
would<00:03:28.560> basically<00:03:28.709> tilt<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.730> building<00:03:30.409> to<00:03:31.409> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
would basically tilt the building to the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.009 
would basically tilt the building to the
57<00:03:32.010> degrees<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:33.030> would<00:03:33.150> sort<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.390> eliminate

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
57 degrees we would sort of eliminate

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.800 
57 degrees we would sort of eliminate
all<00:03:34.260> direct<00:03:34.890> Sun<00:03:35.159> on<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.360> south<00:03:36.540> side

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
all direct Sun on the on the south side

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.420 
all direct Sun on the on the south side
while<00:03:37.739> still<00:03:38.930> maximizing<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:41.069> daylight

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
while still maximizing the the daylight

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.460 
while still maximizing the the daylight
exposure<00:03:41.849> on<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> north<00:03:42.360> as<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:43.110> matter<00:03:43.409> of

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
exposure on the north as a matter of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.140 
exposure on the north as a matter of
fact<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.830> get<00:03:43.950> three<00:03:44.220> times<00:03:44.459> as<00:03:44.700> much<00:03:44.849> light

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
fact you get three times as much light

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.670 
fact you get three times as much light
from<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.510> skylight<00:03:45.959> as<00:03:46.170> from<00:03:46.409> a<00:03:46.440> vertical

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
from a skylight as from a vertical

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.369 
from a skylight as from a vertical
window<00:03:47.159> so<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:48.209> would<00:03:48.360> basically<00:03:48.540> increase

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
window so we would basically increase

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.160 
window so we would basically increase
the<00:03:49.650> amount<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:49.950> daylight<00:03:50.190> by<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.989> same

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
the amount of daylight by and the same

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.979 
the amount of daylight by and the same
time<00:03:52.349> eliminating<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:54.239> exposure<00:03:54.629> to<00:03:54.870> direct

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
time eliminating the exposure to direct

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.670 
time eliminating the exposure to direct
Sun<00:03:56.209> housing<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.599> other<00:03:57.750> hand<00:03:57.959> space<00:03:58.290> into

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
Sun housing on the other hand space into

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.770 
Sun housing on the other hand space into
an<00:03:58.830> heating<00:03:59.220> they<00:03:59.879> want<00:04:00.060> as<00:04:00.209> much<00:04:00.420> Sun<00:04:00.750> as

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
an heating they want as much Sun as

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.640 
an heating they want as much Sun as
possible<00:04:01.019> for<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:02.519> passive<00:04:02.879> solar<00:04:03.030> heat<00:04:03.299> gain

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
possible for for passive solar heat gain

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.410 
possible for for passive solar heat gain
and<00:04:04.650> they<00:04:04.799> also<00:04:05.010> want<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.549> nice<00:04:05.760> terraces

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
and they also want to have nice terraces

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.869 
and they also want to have nice terraces
with<00:04:06.930> Sun<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.439> and<00:04:08.010> Sun<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.489> living<00:04:08.730> room

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
with Sun and and Sun in the living room

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.759 
with Sun and and Sun in the living room
so<00:04:09.569> basically<00:04:09.810> they<00:04:09.930> want<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.200> tilt<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.560> other

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
so basically they want to tilt the other

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.920 
so basically they want to tilt the other
way<00:04:10.970> maximizing<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> exposure<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.659> Sun

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
way maximizing the exposure to the Sun

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.390 
way maximizing the exposure to the Sun
so<00:04:13.920> how<00:04:14.069> can<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.340> combine<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:15.000> sort<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.209> two

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
so how can we combine this sort of two

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.509 
so how can we combine this sort of two
opposing<00:04:17.400> logics<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.269> single<00:04:18.600> building<00:04:19.519> and

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
opposing logics in a single building and

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.189 
opposing logics in a single building and
also<00:04:20.850> none<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.209> them<00:04:21.329> actually<00:04:21.449> work<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:22.079> the

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
also none of them actually work with the

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:22.660 
also none of them actually work with the
traditional

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
traditional

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.840 
traditional
vertical<00:04:23.060> elevator<00:04:23.390> call<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:25.520> suddenly

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
vertical elevator call so suddenly

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.760 
vertical elevator call so suddenly
trying<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.690> battle<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:27.200> sort<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.560> dilemma

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
trying to battle this sort of a dilemma

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.760 
trying to battle this sort of a dilemma
between<00:04:28.220> housing<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.120> office<00:04:29.780> we<00:04:30.440> came<00:04:30.620> up

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
between housing and office we came up

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.950 
between housing and office we came up
with<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.980> idea<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.370> actually<00:04:31.960> stacking

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
with the idea of actually stacking

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
monastic slab gradually turned into this

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.360 
monastic slab gradually turned into this
sort<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.940> six<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.320> silhouette<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.470> office<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
sort of six a silhouette of office and

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.460 
sort of six a silhouette of office and
housing<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.390> if<00:04:50.600> we<00:04:50.690> try<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:50.930> look<00:04:51.140> at<00:04:51.290> how<00:04:51.410> the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
housing and if we try to look at how the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.520 
housing and if we try to look at how the
Sun<00:04:52.060> reaches<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.180> building<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:54.350> can<00:04:54.500> see

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
Sun reaches the building you can see

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.880 
Sun reaches the building you can see
that<00:04:54.890> them<00:04:56.020> all<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.260> offices<00:04:57.680> are

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
that them all of the offices are

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.400 
that them all of the offices are
completely<00:04:58.340> dark<00:04:58.580> all<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.510> housing<00:05:00.140> are

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
completely dark all of the housing are

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.350 
completely dark all of the housing are
completely<00:05:01.010> bright<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:01.940> get<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:02.300> sort

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
completely bright so you get this sort

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.290 
completely bright so you get this sort
of<00:05:02.540> conceptual<00:05:03.530> cebra<00:05:04.100> of<00:05:04.280> shade<00:05:04.700> and<00:05:04.970> sun

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
of conceptual cebra of shade and sun

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.410 
of conceptual cebra of shade and sun
shade<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.260> Sun<00:05:08.260> so<00:05:09.260> define<00:05:09.950> not<00:05:10.280> only<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.730> the

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
shade and Sun so define not only the the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.680 
shade and Sun so define not only the the
6x<00:05:11.870> cigarette<00:05:12.260> from<00:05:12.410> one<00:05:12.560> side<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:13.010> also<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
6x cigarette from one side but also the

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.020 
6x cigarette from one side but also the

the frontal elevation of lightness and

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.230 
the frontal elevation of lightness and
darkness<00:05:19.390> so<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:22.430> essentially<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:22.940> can<00:05:23.090> say

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
darkness so so essentially you can say

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.460 
darkness so so essentially you can say
