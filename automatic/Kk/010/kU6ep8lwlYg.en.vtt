00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.789
 have agreed that after 20 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.890
 anniversary of the yes as in 2009 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.230
 I could do an after session of 9 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:31.130
 from morning to one in the afternoon the first 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:34.489
 day of the year then I found the 2009 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.760
 2010 where end of the year there are about six 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.760
 hours 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 come back and cut 45 in the end we go with 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.150
 the colleagues was an open group me 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.790
 I mean at the level of when I die 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.190
 that they loved then suddenly 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.010
 I started to fail a speaker I decided 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.859
 pull forward 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.800
 and perfect more or less already the 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.010
 loudspeaker sound and I say which one I already 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 stay 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:15.270
 I always remember that, so I do not say ah 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 well yes yes yes I had 22 times and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.940
 He starts talking since he has 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.009
 known good that is doing well 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.649
 like a book but that could also be 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.070
 a documentary 'los y azÃºcar' 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.030
 I also thought an idol 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.030
 of adolescence 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.159
 do not 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 and we said come give us the phones 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.929
 and such and then we were the first 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.939
 meeting with eddie and let's see talking 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.990
 and then there we realized in those 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.850
 first meetings 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.030
 that we had no fucking idea of what 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 today we are going to hide 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.960
 well you know curiously frank 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 he died on the same day as the anniversary of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.290
 operation of jose antonio cousin of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.310
 rivera 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.319
 as a candle 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 then we say that when was it was 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.030
 a healthy universe you could talk about 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.160
 all 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.100
 and turn over all two hundred 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.480
 times and then there we enter in a year 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.770
 of research recorded with a camera 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.800
 that is not of the quality is that with 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.069
 this name nobody nobody would know 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.840
 fernando fernando has been in a series 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.690
 of social political situations 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:49.970
 and musicals then I do not know what you 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:52.819
 it seems this idea that part five 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.370
 as it would be an exact capillary and if I have 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.690
 maybe there are ten chapters yes that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.280
 let's go to declare it then 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.849
 also each one as we imagined this 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.129
 with this work to date we have 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.049
 five years because then on the road we 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.060
 we have found with each one with my 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.010
 history that we have been father for giving 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.010
 Here staff york 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.609
 and this he commented upon being named 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.849
 and has hovered until the exasperation has 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.150
 prolonged until Russia has been prolonged 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.920
 until it has been necessary to almost give away 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.920
 More than 300 hours of videos
