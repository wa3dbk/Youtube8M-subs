 very nice coating what we 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.050
 interested in getting started with such a 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.879

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.190

 it's not just christmas day 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.090
 or your birthday that you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.840
 will occupy no no but indeed the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 whole month 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.100
 the software is complete archi I have 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.610
 found no impossible combination to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 achieve 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 you have to ask yourself what one 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 can do so complete and well it's 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.990
 simply a keyboard entirely 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280
 programmable no key is set to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 the gap you can give them the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.700
 function that you want by the way 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.800
 by a simple letter to the keys 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 multimedia but that's not all and 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.820
 no it would be too easy if not more 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 of that you will be able to give to each 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.180
 function or key a colors 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.650
 respective or colorimetric 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.110
 whole for the keys 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.360
 selected I can seem blurry then 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.500
 let's start with a little example imagine 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 that I wish illuminated but touches 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.670
 zqsd in red permanently but the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 see appear in white during a 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 action taken on league of legends 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 for example well I 'll only have to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420
 spend five little minutes to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.380
 set everything up and I'm ready to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.060
 attack his henchmen 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 you understood me nothing is impossible 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.620
 with that at 70 rgv apart maybe a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 only thing to buy it without the 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.860
 purse do the head you 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.450
 you are such a keyboard can not be 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.759
 affordable by sir and madam all the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.990
 world therefore had about 150 euros 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.970
 to have it in your hands 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.739
 many other options are still at 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 go as you go back where we 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.400
 find a bios mode that will help 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.750
 disable the multimedia keys by 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.239
 example to ensure compatibility 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 with other older computers 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.690
 I may have one little complaint about 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 to do is the connection 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.890
 detachable on this case 70 16 gb which 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.110
 yet were present on the cac 70 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.880
 if not once the software in hand we 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.470
 come to our ends to set it up to 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.730
 our wishes even if I have to confess 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.860
 after four good hours of use 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 I have not succeeded in everything yet 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.459
 applied and understand the use of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 some functions again and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.640
 as I can advise you to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 every time think about your needs 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 before embarking on such a purchase 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.709
 which may be for some more 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.420
 handicapping than anything else why 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.769
 did I employ disabling all 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.080
 simply because the touch of the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.120
 keyboard is far from innocuous on the one 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.200
 here the red switches are present for 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.519
 those who do not know 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.080
 the next term the links in the 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.600
 description will surely enlighten you 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.220
 so knowing that red switches make 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.319
 part of those who request the least 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.329
 press to activate the 45 g key 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.519
 exactly we have so at the exit 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.290
 a very high sensitivity a finger that 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.209
 skips when writing and you are good 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.739
 to rewrite your sentence this being 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.630
 a reaction at first but that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.950
 can quickly turn into an advantage because 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.660
 with good practice I can you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.579
 ensure that even critics will 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.530
 not as fast as you understand so 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.239
 good to finish that you have to be a hooker 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.160
 pc to be able to transform all these 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.810
 small disadvantages in advantage I 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.850
 think to have finally finished with this 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.470
 product rather beefy to describe all 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.850
 the information is in descriptions 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.859
 do not forget to leave your opinions your 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.390
 remarks on the video as well as the name 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.829
 of your keyboard in the comments 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.269
 but until you do everything 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.470
 I tell you take care of yourself 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.470
 see you next time 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.070
 after
