Hello everybody this is Sitti from SittiphatGaming
and I am here today going to talk to you guys

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.449
today about two upcoming games that I know
that you guys like myself are very excited

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.449
for.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.059
November has been a crazy month of gaming
where big titles are coming out every single

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.059
week!

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.610
Next week on Tuesday November 18th the long-awaited
GTA V and Far Cry 4 will be coming to next

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.720
generation consoles.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
However, I know that most of us have already
bought many games and will probably spend

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.471
more than $100 in this superfluous month of
November for gaming, which begs to ask the

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:21.060
question whether or not you should buy both
GTA V and Far Cry 4?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.890
Both are very similar in many ways, but at
the same time very different.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.570
Not too long ago, Rockstar announced (probably
by the inspiration of the modding community)

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.720
that GTA V, will be available in first person
with beautiful newly designed interiors in

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.119
all vehicles.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.950
This begs to ask another question has GTA
V become a better version of Far Cry?

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.220
Like Far Cry 4, GTA V now has the first-person
option, living, breathing animals, and of

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.299
course both are in open worlds.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.439
Even though both are again set in an open
world environment, I think they are still

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.969
very different from where you have the bright,
bustling city of Los Santos to the high mountains

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.060
of Kyrat.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.909
This one thing to me already makes both games
unique in its own way.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.580
Also, I can’t forget to mention are you
tired of GTA and prefer the “newer” Far

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.580
Cry?

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.580
So overall, what do you guys think?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.500
Has GTA V become the better Far Cry?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.310
Do you prefer the fresher, new Far Cry compared
to GTA?

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.920
Which one are you going to buy?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.150
Both, just one, or even neither?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.090
Please leave your comments and opinions in
the description down below and I’ll let

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.790
you guys continue to watch the rest of the
little trailer compilation of both GTA V and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.739
Far Cry 4 that I made to help you guys compare,
contrast, and decide which one to buy.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:07:04.800
This is Sitti from SittiphatGaming and I'll
see you on the other side.
