game but they're really focusing on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
game but they're really focusing on
making<00:00:51.930> sure<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.309> this

making sure that you know that this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
making sure that you know that this
isn't<00:00:53.670> another<00:00:53.969> call<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> duty<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
isn't another call of duty it's going to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.750 
isn't another call of duty it's going to
be<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> blend<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.829> tactical<00:00:56.340> play<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
be a blend of tactical play and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
be a blend of tactical play and
fast-paced<00:00:57.120> gameplay<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.649> that's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
fast-paced gameplay and I think that's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
fast-paced gameplay and I think that's
really<00:00:58.859> cool<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.489> something<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.180> kind

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
really cool with something that we kind

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
really cool with something that we kind
of<00:01:00.449> need<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:00.870> call<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> duty<00:01:01.710> spine<00:01:01.980> but

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of need because call of duty spine but

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
of need because call of duty spine but
it<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> mindless<00:01:03.180> shooter<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> lot<00:01:03.870> of

much<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:21.060> got<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.390> excited<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
much that really got me excited for the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
much that really got me excited for the
game<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.290> mean<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.950> gunplay<00:01:23.369> looks<00:01:23.670> really

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
game I mean the gunplay looks really

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
game I mean the gunplay looks really
solid<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.780> thing<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> worries<00:01:25.830> me

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
solid that's my thing that worries me

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
solid that's my thing that worries me
the<00:01:26.189> most<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.640> new<00:01:26.759> games<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> gunplay

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the most in new games is is the gunplay

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.010 
the most in new games is is the gunplay
going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.860> solid<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.659> know<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.990> thing

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to be solid and you know one thing

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
going to be solid and you know one thing
I<00:01:31.229> noticed<00:01:31.259> from<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> game

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I noticed from this is that is the game

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
I noticed from this is that is the game
types<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.329> focusing<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.900> new<00:01:34.020> game

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
types are really focusing on new game

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.569 
types are really focusing on new game
types<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> top<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> screen<00:01:35.250> here

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
types look at the top of the screen here

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.190 
types look at the top of the screen here
I've<00:01:35.939> slowed<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:37.020> some

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I've slowed it down so you can see some

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.179 
I've slowed it down so you can see some
of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> weapons<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
of the weapons you know you see the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.090 
of the weapons you know you see the
aks-74u<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.140> there<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.829> says

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
aks-74u you can see there that it says

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
aks-74u you can see there that it says
enemies<00:01:41.579> left<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> obviously<00:01:42.509> going

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
enemies left so this is obviously going

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
enemies left so this is obviously going
to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> new<00:01:43.500> game<00:01:43.799> type<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.280> probably

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
to be a new game type it's probably

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
to be a new game type it's probably
going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.909> similar<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.509> defender<00:01:45.990> point

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
going to be similar to a defender point

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
going to be similar to a defender point
until<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.649> run<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> tickets<00:01:47.250> type

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
until they run out of tickets type

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
until they run out of tickets type
scenario<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.630> could<00:01:48.780> even<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> co-op

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
scenario or it could even be a co-op

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
scenario or it could even be a co-op
mission<00:01:50.189> I'm<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.579> sure<00:01:50.850> there's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.540> still

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
mission I'm not sure there's a lot still

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
mission I'm not sure there's a lot still

I hated launching the game from my
browser<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.900> grew<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.080> me<00:02:15.230> over<00:02:15.590> time<00:02:15.770> and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
browser but it grew on me over time and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
it it's pretty pretty useful from time

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.540 
it it's pretty pretty useful from time
to<00:02:27.320> time<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.650> I'm<00:02:27.800> not<00:02:27.980> gonna<00:02:28.100> say<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.520> I

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.970 
to time now I'm not gonna say that I
like<00:02:28.790> browser<00:02:29.120> launching<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:30.620> for<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.830> most

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
like browser launching but for the most

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.949 
like browser launching but for the most
part<00:02:31.100> battlelog<00:02:31.940> wasn't<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.480> bad<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.930> know

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
part battlelog wasn't that bad you know

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
I got used to it to the point where you
