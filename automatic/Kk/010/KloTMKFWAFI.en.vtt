Dutch<00:01:56.520> braid<00:01:56.900> after<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> cross<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.409> strands

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
Dutch braid after I cross the strands

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
Dutch braid after I cross the strands
about<00:01:58.950> five<00:01:59.159> times<00:01:59.430> i'm<00:01:59.790> taking<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> middle

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
about five times i'm taking the middle

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.390 
about five times i'm taking the middle
strand<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.020> splitting<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.590> into<00:02:01.770> two<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
strand in splitting it into two and

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.250

braid you typically take thin strands of
hair<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.670> outside<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.269> braid<00:02:15.480> but

for the inverted fishtail braid you want

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.670 
for the inverted fishtail braid you want
to<00:02:17.849> take<00:02:18.060> thin<00:02:18.360> strands<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.989> hair<00:02:19.049> from<00:02:19.500> the

inside<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.280> braid<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:21.269> I'm<00:02:21.360> taking<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
inside of the braid so I'm taking a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
inside of the braid so I'm taking a
small<00:02:22.140> piece<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.530> hair<00:02:22.739> from<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> inside<00:02:23.069> of

the braid and crossing it over to the
back<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.470> braid<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.890> combining<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.520> with

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
back of the braid and combining it with

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880 
back of the braid and combining it with
the<00:02:26.790> opposite<00:02:27.240> section<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.810> repeating<00:02:28.650> these

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the opposite section I'm repeating these

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.470 
the opposite section I'm repeating these
steps<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.310> about<00:02:29.610> another<00:02:29.760> eight

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
steps for about another eight

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:41.250 
steps for about another eight
silvers

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.720 

after<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:42.440> I'm<00:02:42.710> taking<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.190> section<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.670> hair

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
after this I'm taking a section of hair

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.340 
after this I'm taking a section of hair
from<00:02:43.940> each<00:02:44.210> strand<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.780> create<00:02:45.080> three

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
from each strand to create three

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.960 
from each strand to create three
sections<00:02:45.800> again<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:46.550> I'm<00:02:46.670> repeating

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
sections again and then I'm repeating

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.640 
sections again and then I'm repeating
the<00:02:47.240> same<00:02:47.420> technique<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.840> create<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.440> Dutch

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the same technique to create a Dutch

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.400 
the same technique to create a Dutch
braid<00:02:48.680> like<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.280> did<00:02:49.460> at<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> beginning<00:02:49.820> after

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
braid like I did at the beginning after

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.020 
braid like I did at the beginning after
another<00:02:51.410> five<00:02:51.710> crossovers<00:02:52.430> or<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.760> I'm

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
another five crossovers or so I'm

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.730 
another five crossovers or so I'm
sectioning<00:02:53.600> my<00:02:53.720> hair<00:02:53.900> into<00:02:54.080> two<00:02:54.200> strands

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
sectioning my hair into two strands

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.590 
sectioning my hair into two strands
again<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.280> creating<00:02:55.730> another<00:02:56.060> inverted

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
again and creating another inverted

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.210 
again and creating another inverted
fishtail<00:02:56.870> braid<00:02:57.320> until<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.710> can't<00:02:58.010> braid

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
fishtail braid until I can't braid

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:11.520 
fishtail braid until I can't braid
anymore

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.630 

once<00:03:12.530> I've<00:03:12.680> reached<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.099> end<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.310> my<00:03:13.370> braid

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
once I've reached the end of my braid

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.550 
once I've reached the end of my braid
I'm<00:03:13.819> tying<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.239> off<00:03:14.450> with<00:03:14.810> two<00:03:15.019> small<00:03:15.290> hair

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
I'm tying it off with two small hair

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.369 
I'm tying it off with two small hair
elastics<00:03:16.040> now<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:17.269> is<00:03:17.569> my<00:03:17.840> favorite<00:03:18.110> part

those long sections of hair that we

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.710 
those long sections of hair that we
separated<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.700> beginning<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.239> wrap<00:03:45.540> them

with<00:03:49.319> bobby<00:03:49.440> pins<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:50.610> will<00:03:50.790> make<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.060> braid

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
with bobby pins this will make the braid

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.990 
with bobby pins this will make the braid
look<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.540> little<00:03:51.780> more<00:03:51.900> polished<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:53.519> add<00:03:53.700> a
