 that also does not make appointments 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.890
 Do you think your kids would know how to 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.300
 But a banzer will not have that 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.450
 know her like a video game, the 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.080
 afterwards also works on it otherwise 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.110
 what's the right thing but we had 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.210
 the best parties because he has too 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.310
 more time to prepare 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.320
 hung around with our fat hours 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.119
 then my second slope was no 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.249
 topic but we had no stress in 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.569

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.339
 the bike through the area 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.929
 always in the fresh air when he is 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.819
 healthy 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.260
 Today only in cycling everything needs 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.129
 others ask the city of the am 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.339
 heart and in the summer itself in the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.429
 Internet 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.989
 that's what we are in favor of europe to the fullest 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.469
 enjoyed the music throughout 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.469
 driven area 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.209
 that with the schweriner to boogie ok 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.859
 eat 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.510
 but then we have a friendly 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.070
 met and met europe 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.070
 have active is wonderful 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.510
 the eyes also unbelievably flow 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.240
 peace dove right because we yes 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.970
 actually a peace that was one 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.490
 real topic and Chernobyl has us 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.220
 that was such a turning point in 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.960
 our lifes 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.360
 we have chosen to be conscious 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.640
 have value in which we developed at that time 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.110
 Today, I'm still important 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.290
 think our youth today people the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.610
 need exactly this and we would have 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.230
 they are still on it but we 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.670
 We must realize that he still 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.250
 draufhaben themselves are the felt 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.010
 something a generation at the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.020
 turn on turn on 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.020
