beef<00:01:43.180> we're<00:01:43.689> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.900> cook<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.259> for<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.220> little

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
beef we're going to cook it for a little

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.280 
beef we're going to cook it for a little
while<00:01:45.430> just<00:01:45.580> on<00:01:46.150> each<00:01:46.330> side<00:01:46.659> because<00:01:47.049> what<00:01:47.259> I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
while just on each side because what I

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.810 
while just on each side because what I
want<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.619> do<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.130> not<00:01:48.250> really<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.520> sear

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
want to do is it's not really a sear

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.310 
want to do is it's not really a sear
because<00:01:49.180> we've<00:01:49.360> got<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:49.750> much<00:01:49.869> distance

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
because we've got so much distance

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.160 
because we've got so much distance
between<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.770> fire<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:52.060> rag<00:01:52.330> but<00:01:52.689> but

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
between the fire and the rag but but

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.660 
between the fire and the rag but but
it's<00:01:53.290> still<00:01:53.619> going<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.009> caramelize<00:01:54.310> the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
it's still going to caramelize the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
it's still going to caramelize the
outside<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:55.090> little<00:01:55.330> bit

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
outside a little bit

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.679 
outside a little bit
and<00:01:55.920> give<00:01:56.399> us<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> nice<00:01:56.670> crust<00:01:57.119> flavor<00:01:57.420> lock

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and give us a nice crust flavor lock

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.599 
and give us a nice crust flavor lock
some<00:01:57.929> of<00:01:58.020> those<00:01:58.109> juices<00:01:58.380> inside<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.310> chuck

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
some of those juices inside this chuck

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.459 
some of those juices inside this chuck
roast<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:00.929> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.079> put<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
roast then we're going to put it in a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.130 
roast then we're going to put it in a
pan<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> braise<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.759> all<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.600> doing<00:02:03.990> is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
pan and braise it so all I'm doing is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.749 
pan and braise it so all I'm doing is
just<00:02:04.229> putting<00:02:04.619> making<00:02:04.950> sure<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.429> put<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
just putting making sure that I put it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.819 
just putting making sure that I put it
on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> rack<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:07.049> over<00:02:07.350> where<00:02:07.469> my<00:02:07.619> hot

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
on the rack right over where my hot

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.830 
on the rack right over where my hot
coals<00:02:08.099> are<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.179> probably<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.660> give

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
coals are and I'm probably going to give

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.059

check on it maybe flip it over to the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.119 
check on it maybe flip it over to the
other<00:02:12.629> side<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.440> color<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.830> want
