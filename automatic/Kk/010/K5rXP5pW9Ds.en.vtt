00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.530
 2013 for one-year hunting optics 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.269
 of extraordinary innovations and the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.220
 term is not abused this time 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.840
 extraordinary innovations refer 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 to speed up shooting times 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.289
 to the increase of precision in instruments 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 that offer integration between optics 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.560
 electronics and measurement of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.240
 unprecedented distance has 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 a mechanical reliability that one is not 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.550
 never seen in hunting scopes 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 all together for the hunter in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 something really extraordinary me 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.030
 I refer to the possibility of pressing a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 button on a rangefinder or binoculars 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.930
 with the rangefinder 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.640
 and in three tenths of a second to have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 directly by blowing all the turrets 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.080
 ballistic the number of clicks to give 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.809
 to the ballistic tower that is on the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.610
 eyeglass top using telescopes 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.020
 of which we can trust blindly 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.640
 keep the clicks and excuse the game of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.640
 words blindly for an optical 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.810
 before or up to this point it was 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.149
 possible to have a rangefinder that gave 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.469
 the distance maybe correct with respect to the 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.909
 site angle 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.799
 then tables had to be used 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.670
 that converted this distance into 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.200
 click will give a ballistic turret or in 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 distances corresponding to references up 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.939
 these turrets or on the ballistic network 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.429
 and then one had to hope and no one would 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 trust your own clicks that the clicks of 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.729
 own telescope were proof of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.869
 bomb today with the new geo reduced for 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.869
 42 hdb 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 it can be for the first time in history 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.520
 of an optical instrument to interact with 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.990
 the optical instrument or thanks to the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.880
 micro sd card like those of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.009
 mobile phones to be inserted here 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.180
 can be saved on this tab 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.479
 micro sd 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.030
 the data of the ball you use and then 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.649
 when you press the button to measure 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:07.000
 the distance you get a lot 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.789
 simple than distance and then in base 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.800
 to the ball used at the site corner 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.120
 at the same temperature and distance 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 atmospheric pressure then with the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.860
 absolute maximum precision the number of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.810
 click to give to your turret 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.880
 Ballistics There are five units of measurement 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.569
 possible therefore any they have 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.569
 clear is fine 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.600
 and the extraordinary innovation here is that 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.190
 when I have this data I no longer have 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 I don't need ballistic turrets 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.470
 need to check though if it changes 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.520
 the angle what happens with respect to clicks 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.170
 I simply take the data and it 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.630
 I apply my ballistic turret 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 now this can be done if I do 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.740
 I blindly trust the click system 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.080
 the appointment of singlets know 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.360
 than most telescopes from 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.290
 fighters have click systems and they are 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.760
 born of a design from decades ago when 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.459
 on the non- site turrets you did n't have to 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.110
 absolutely put your hands when i 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.370
 calibers were much less driven than 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.840
 those of today 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.000
 and when the distances pull a lot 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.570
 minor 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.210
 the like a magnus as well as like airplanes 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.240
 that is about to come out on the market right now 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.720
 May the newly-born telescopes 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.810
 and therefore with a new conception and the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.540
 unique and not afraid to say the only ones in the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.950
 hunting glasses market yes 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.600
 mind you say from hunting because if 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.600
 we take the rifle scopes or from 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.950
 military obviously from a point of view 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.680
 mechanics are are different though that a 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.880
 eyewear typically used today 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.830
 He never has an internal system 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.540
 click that has a mechanic like 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.930
 this one we have the heart of 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.350
 mouse click tower or 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.820
 of arrays there is no single piece 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.190
 of the whole tower that is not of 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.040
 metal and all the mechanics that it is 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.800
 moves in steel 60 on the board of 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.230
 rockol the ring as hard as possible 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.150
 external clicks 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.820
 comes into contact with this wheel 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.560
 very high here we talk in general about 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.209
 plastic wheels toothed with 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.010
 ball bearings that cannot 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.750
 guarantee the keeping of the clicks here 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.940
 we have a very simple mechanism for 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.030
 which when you click a tooth a 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.890
 tip falls and falls into the tooth 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.040
 next on the outer ring is 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.240
 impossible that does not take a click 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.710
 let's talk about inner tubes in the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.120
 telescope for appointment which a 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.650
 unlike those existing on the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.660
 market that are suspended on springs for 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.790
 cushion the scope of the recoil today with 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.919
 the metals of today and the technology of 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.870
 assembly and the machines that are today the 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.940
 tolerances instead is possible and so 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.010
 it happens in the magnus to have internal tubes 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.960
 stuck in the outer tube 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.400
 this guarantees the stability of the pattern 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.050
 even those calibers more driven with i 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.550
 muzzle brakes etcetera etcetera thing 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.840
 which is impossible to guarantee to others 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.490
 appointment rowers 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.320
 plus we have a standard tube 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.480
 military more often than all the others 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.960
 hunting tubes a millimeter and a half 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.550
 all these things here cost 70 80 grams 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.620
 more than others who have 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.030
 clarified appointment so I do not 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.650
 come and tell the stupidity that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.850
 the problem with the glasses is weight 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.800
 when there are 80 g of difference then 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.410
 to sum up why I spoke 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.930
 in the beginning it was pompously 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.970
 extraordinary innovations and an era 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.690
 revolutionary that begins this year 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.889
 because actually today we have 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.190
 distance measurement tools 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.440
 that allow in a very short time e 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.169
 at distances up to 2 kilometers 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.810
 even to have directly from the 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.580
 tool based on your own ball already 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.650
 the number of clicks and to give the turret 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.870
 ballistics and the telescope 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.880
 appointments that allow you to trust 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.039
 absolutely also hunting and therefore 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.860
 not just at an estate polygon 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.500
 absolute of the precision of the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.840
 telescope and an absolute seal 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.039
 of the mechanical click system if 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.780
 these are not innovations 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.160
 extraordinary me in ten years of 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.539
 optical industries I have never seen one 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.539
 something like that even remotely
