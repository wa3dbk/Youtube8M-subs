you

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.010 

young<00:00:14.430> age<00:00:14.610> group<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.090> think<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.629> health<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
young age group I think the health and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.109 
young age group I think the health and
Anil<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.500> enough<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.070> it'll<00:00:17.640> come<00:00:17.910> back

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
Anil is enough that it'll come back

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.480 
Anil is enough that it'll come back
it'll<00:00:18.779> come<00:00:18.960> back<00:00:18.990> normal

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it'll come back normal

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.420 
it'll come back normal
as<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:21.090> age<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.630> process<00:00:22.110> is<00:00:22.430> somewhat

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
as we age that process is somewhat

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.300 
as we age that process is somewhat
attenuated<00:00:23.700> I<00:00:24.380> think<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> nail<00:00:25.980> bed

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
attenuated I think if the nail bed

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.600 
attenuated I think if the nail bed
itself<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.180> lifted<00:00:27.750> off<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> has<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> sub<00:00:29.099> ungol

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
itself is lifted off and has a sub ungol

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.210 
itself is lifted off and has a sub ungol
hematoma<00:00:30.509> in<00:00:30.869> other<00:00:31.020> words<00:00:31.259> collection<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
hematoma in other words collection of

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.720 
hematoma in other words collection of
blood<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:33.300> blood<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:34.110> drained<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
blood that blood has to be drained there

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.190 
blood that blood has to be drained there
are<00:00:35.850> several<00:00:36.059> ways<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.020> just

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
are several ways to do that you can just

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.139 
are several ways to do that you can just
make<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> hole<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:37.980> nail<00:00:38.250> bed<00:00:38.520> itself<00:00:38.910> which

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
make a hole in the nail bed itself which

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.740 
make a hole in the nail bed itself which
really<00:00:39.360> doesn't<00:00:39.750> hurt<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.750> safety

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
really doesn't hurt you can use a safety

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
really doesn't hurt you can use a safety
pin<00:00:42.930> or<00:00:43.110> something<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> let<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pin or something like that and let the

they fall off very common here in

they fall off very common here in
Arizona<00:01:32.749> if<00:01:33.749> a<00:01:33.899> nail<00:01:34.109> falls<00:01:34.649> off

Arizona if a nail falls off
spontaneously<00:01:35.819> for<00:01:36.149> for<00:01:36.479> whatever<00:01:36.689> reason

spontaneously for for whatever reason
the<00:01:38.459> nail<00:01:39.149> will<00:01:39.389> come<00:01:39.569> back<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the nail will come back because the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
the nail will come back because the
matrix<00:01:42.090> where<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.329> nail<00:01:42.600> grows<00:01:42.899> from<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
matrix where the nail grows from is the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
matrix where the nail grows from is the
portion<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.209> probably<00:01:46.139> still<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.439> good

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
portion that will probably still be good

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.819 
portion that will probably still be good
the<00:01:47.279> problem<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.819> we<00:01:47.969> see<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.619> nail

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the problem that we see is that the nail

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.230 
the problem that we see is that the nail
bed<00:01:50.459> itself<00:01:50.969> being<00:01:51.749> unprotected<00:01:53.060> starts<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
bed itself being unprotected starts to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.899 
bed itself being unprotected starts to
change<00:01:54.899> shape<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.889> the<00:01:56.069> nail<00:01:56.279> that's<00:01:56.490> coming

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
change shape so the nail that's coming

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.289 
change shape so the nail that's coming
in<00:01:57.619> rides<00:01:58.619> across<00:01:58.859> this<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.700> tongue<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
in rides across this like tongue and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.349 
in rides across this like tongue and
grooves<00:02:00.539> type<00:02:01.349> like<00:02:01.619> surface<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:03.209> it

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
grooves type like surface and if it

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.279 
grooves type like surface and if it
catches<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.499> off<00:02:04.829> line<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.389> it<00:02:06.539> will<00:02:06.689> dig

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
catches or is off line then it will dig

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.350 
catches or is off line then it will dig
into<00:02:07.499> the<00:02:07.740> nail<00:02:07.889> and<00:02:08.039> you'll<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.360> ingrown

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
into the nail and you'll get a ingrown

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.839 
into the nail and you'll get a ingrown
toenail<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.560> term<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.310> called<00:02:11.459> own

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
toenail and term for that is called own

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.020 
toenail and term for that is called own
eco<00:02:12.120> gripe<00:02:12.930> Phocis<00:02:13.440> or<00:02:14.040> crypto<00:02:14.580> sious<00:02:14.849> and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
eco gripe Phocis or crypto sious and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.059 
eco gripe Phocis or crypto sious and
when<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.959> happens<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.680> might<00:02:16.890> get<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
when that happens then we might get a

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.059 
when that happens then we might get a
secondary<00:02:17.730> bacterial<00:02:18.330> infection<00:02:18.890> first<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
secondary bacterial infection first I

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.240 
secondary bacterial infection first I
think<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.280> make<00:02:20.520> sure<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.209> clean<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
think you make sure that it's clean and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
think you make sure that it's clean and
