00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 or the people of youtube since the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.700
 cowboy and welcome a new gameplay 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.349
 of the call of duty modern warfare 3 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 after so much time I'm worthy to play 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.870
 this fucking game again after 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 more or less almost 10 months to leave 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 due to the output of whites 2 and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.660
 really because I had the balls at 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.119
 dish will play you very, very bad 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 multiplayer and I decided to go back yesterday just 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.260
 to record this example today 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.699
 since we're going to talk about conductives and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.320
 what I expect in relation to the day of 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 tomorrow the presentation of the multiplayer 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 of the call of duty ghosts and I think that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.930
 it was the fourth game he played 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 I really played very little because they gave me 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 eager to take out which shit and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 you are going to notice how he keeps playing 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.770
 people after 10 months people with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.719
 murdered people from my team that was camping 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 people launchers with booths and with 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 all those crap that only we 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.739
 they frustrated the game for hours 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 I think it was not very good I took a 19 6 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.649
 really nothing more serious this game 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.010
 because it was one of the best appointments that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.239
 take out the worst but simply 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 I bring you this example and just for 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.360
 remind them that this game is about 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.750
 infinity ward is the last game that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.730
 pulls out 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.010
 and with respect to the collective that is the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.570
 that is coming let's see how it is and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 we all hope they are much better 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 that is modern warfare 3 and a little 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.300
 better than white 2 because also the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.490
 White 2 many people are no longer 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.050
 playing that sold it and I wanted it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.180
 get out of top et cetera etcetera 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.440
 etcetera to make this video dedicate 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.060
 yesterday a couple of minutes 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.740
 thinking about what he really wanted in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.570
 this call of duty boss which is the number 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.670
 10 of the saga I hope it is very but 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.560
 very good and just the day of arriving 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.930
 the people of gametrailers that are the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.000
 managers within so many companies of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.009
 videogames in trying the game before 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.680
 come out I think they're going to be the day of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 tomorrow the presentation also and I was 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.710
 watching a video they did about what 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.509
 that they just wanted you not to 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 I was and what they want me to be 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.680
 in this new title of the saga of call 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.450
 of duty talked about the issue of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.000
 customization they want to make the game 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.399
 as more more personalized so that each 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.619
 player is identified or is for example 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.240
 if I put on an emblem that someone else does not 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.160
 have to be impossible that the other 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.110
 have it that the weapons have a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.330
 camouflage for one and that another one either 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.769
 you can get the shit out of the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.060
 camouflages payment the people were 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.470
 outraged with that I understand 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 perfectly for what 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.220
 camouflages that are practically 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.440
 repeated or some and most do not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.150
 they were so good and well that was for 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.370
 one side later with respect to the maps 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750
 they are much more destructive than 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.010
 maps are much more dynamic and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.200
 just that is something that is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.270
 confirmed that at least all 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 maps are going to have something dynamic maybe 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.060
 does not dry a rock and cuts the step in 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.830
 a part of the map or I do not know things that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.350
 can put to change a little the 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.000
 environment not of the map and another thing that 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.400
 they talked that I thought it was very cool and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.680
 would be very good to put it is the subject 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 of the team score tricks that is this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.970
 well that each player of a team 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.650
 have to do something in particular to 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.450
 get a specific streak through 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.730
 example if we want to take for example not 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.370
 a what to be that one of the team 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 catch the flag see that another capture 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.450
 the flag causes one to kill four 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.700
 consecutive and so it would be an idea 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.020
 very original or was it based for 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.340
 play in team 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.560
 I do not think obviously that they put it in 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.600
 all modes is more I do not think what 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.760
 put because the call of duty is a 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.580
 more game to play in freedom a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.680
 player can kill himself 30 and the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.359
 rest of the equipment that is well pt 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.920
 and win the game the same not like everyone 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.109
 They know how all call players 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.670
 of duty we know what can happen to us and for 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.560
 last other things that were named the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.049
 theme of the knives that fix the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 knives that are disgusting no command 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.829
 and no knife talks to two and that 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.810
 Of course there are no vehicles because it is not 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.459
 something original of the call of duty in this 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.849
 appearance beats the edge far exceeds 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.099
 it is obvious and the truth that I would hate to be 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.650
 playing with tanks or traveling 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.810
 long long map paths to 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.370
 kill some and good that those but 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.200
 me regarding the presentation of the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.299
 Wednesday before starting them 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.790
 I mean they were giving the hi 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.099
 hard stick they put a photo with respect 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.829
 to the parents some parts we have for 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.629
 example and we see the scavenger other than 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.459
 it seems that we can stab him at his 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.780
 see us and another that we can recharge 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.609
 while we run this is not 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.169
 confirmed there is no confirmed pair 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.120
 it is an image that is made at random 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.099
 surely the single design of the pairs 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.079
 that the color will be used in the 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.699
 multiplayer mode and they also put a 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
 brief trailer of less than a minute 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.910
 where they are going to do the different 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.199
 presentations of this game 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.030
 multiplayer for example we have the 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.830
 gamescom in germany then we have 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.960
 another event in brazil this one 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.909
 Wednesday on the angels between 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.349
 fabric and so on and all the places where 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.689
 is going to be presented before the 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.129
 launch of this game of course 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.569
 well what I expect with respect 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.699
 to this game first do not go back to the 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.189
 of strikes I obviously do not want to see a 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.129
 martyrdom out there a hand of the maimed by 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.960
 there but not even in fart we had enough 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.300
 in modern warfare 3 I hope this 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.909
 do not come back anymore the black of 12 pulled this out and 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.919
 it was a great but great breakthrough but as 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.259
 everything good afterwards comes something 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.550
 bad in the call of duty cous i hope that 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.810
 do not do the same for example in the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.270
 white 2 we have a seeker of 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.370
 whites the famous seeker to which both 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.129
 irritates us and obviously I hope that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.599
 take out all the attacks mind that falls 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.520
 in the game experience for example 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.840
 Dual band are not say it is not so 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.699
 used in comparison to the search engine 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.830
 whites who abuse her all day 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.710
 with a search engine for whites especially in 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.900
 the light machines and it's irritating not 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.509
 there is always a pass, especially 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.270
 moments when there is never a 20 25 24 x 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.520
 7 Always always use a search engine of 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.199
 white is impossible to escape from it and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.830
 I hope they do not put any attachment 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.300
 soto 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.040
 obviously I also want new 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.470
 graphics that surprise me that fly me 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.900
 the head not like the campaign that was 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.490
 something we've already seen are practically the 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.320
 modern warfare 3 graphics or 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.840
 white two boys change the engine 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.580
 graphic please come play 4 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.680
 and the xbox one is coming you have to change 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.030
 the graphical engine already if it is not now in 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.860
 this title that is the one that comes but 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.170
 I want you to surprise me conductive 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.940
 graphically after the theme of the 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.310
 dynamic maps seem like a great idea 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.230
 let's see how they implement that 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.600
 of the dynamic maps I saw it a lot in the 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.090
 killzone is taken of course from 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.100
 another game of that genre and finally 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.880
 I want to tell you about the weapons that 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.150
 weapons are many that there is a lot of balance 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.700
 if there is a person using an ak-47 and me 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.700
 I'm using a cr both he and I 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.220
 we can kill not that the cr always wins 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.590
 or that the ak-47 always win hands 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.820
 hand that is a balance with respect to 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.220
 the gusts I expect something completely 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.620
 new that avenges the nuclear again 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.510
 fashion tactics the nook or as 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.860
 want to call them I hope he comes back and 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.320
 to make the video the theme of the 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.840
 parents I want there to be much more happen more 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.880
 or less 15 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.430
 that at the most you can put four or 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.050
 five pairs in the same class and that there 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.970
 different combinations for example that 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.710
 would enter mentioned some of this by 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.110
 example the flash jacket that there is one 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.120
 to prevent explosives and another to 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.340
 prevent bullets or that those bullets do 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.350
 least harm I thought it was a good idea that 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.610
 make different combinations and for 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.440
 example was thinking about the topic of 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.380
 ghost that they can do for example 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.630
 a strange combination that per per 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.940
 example allows you to hide in zones 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.310
 outdoors in open areas but 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.320
 to show you on the map when you're 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.479
 In a house like this, they get complicated 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.610
 the theme of the champion that would be a great 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.350
 idea not infinity ward against fear for 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.090
 please so folks if they like this 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.010
 video leave law and favorites as always 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.360
 let's hope that infinity ward does not 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.340
 dazzle with the presentation of 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.810
 multiplayer and to the day Thursday also 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.540
 presents another game also mode 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:33.169
 multiplayer the presentation of 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.539
 algete as well as multiplayer for the first 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:37.430
 time I'm more excited for a gta than 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:39.199
 for a call of duty acidity I hope that the 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.610
 break the trailer of the gta was 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.990
 Awesome 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.450
 let's hope that the call of duty is that that 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.470
 height practically and we said the best 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.660
 for these two titles 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.700

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.590
