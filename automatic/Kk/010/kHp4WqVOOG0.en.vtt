 welcome my name is falcon and today i

 tell you about the movie signal 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.750
 that fuck him so dull tightened 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.420
 tedious and completely empty picture i 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.040
 no longer seen refrain from 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.320
 going to the cinema for this movie 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.390
 Well, the picture called guilty 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.339
 star tears squeeze and flax i have a melodrama 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.769
 for girls, but there plays shailin woodley 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.750
 and who played mary jane watson in 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.610
 new spider-man only you her there 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.159
 see since all the scenes with her 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 cut out to heras doggy I suggest 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.759
 reflect on why 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.220
 film new spiderman high 

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:04.290
 tension or or myosin spider-man 2 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.619
 turned out so what happened 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 and could it be better the answer is simple up 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.670
 the film could be much better on my 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.100
 I judge the look by the fact that they were 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.079
 published data that the script 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.689
 film authorship Roberto Orsi 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.060
 the original script has been heavily modified 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.250
 on this subject a great movie made cassi 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.110
 soft reference you will find in the description i 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.329
 I will not dwell on 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 the volume that was changed will simply list 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.250
 key points and so the first should 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.590
 Max Maxillon's mother was present 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.050
 who considered her son a nonentity 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 what explains his kind of madness and thirst 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.549
 attention was spelled literate 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 the cause of Max's nervous breakdown being already 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 electro public is also a surprise in 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.510
 Peter gave his original script 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.940
 harry osborne's blood creating thereby 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.830
 his enemy and in the script was not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.600
 that crap related to how goblin 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.909
 electro unite only with 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.580
 using the phrase I need you irina there 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.619
 almost no more detail with all 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.930
 changes in the script you can 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.909
 read and in the role of what bruises but a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.670
 we will try to find the answer 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.679
 why all these changes were made to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.790
 scripts and then another from the movie what for 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.090
 prices have cut 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 we will also consider them as a whole in response to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.010
 question why script redrew and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.170
 very simplified obvious company sony 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.599
 unduly interfere in production 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.580
 process and fear of failure as well as 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.530
 trying to compete with disney they 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.900
 took a number of hasty and not always 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.609
 surefire making the first film was also 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.610
 pretty cut and despite 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.650
 impressive 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.840
 uranium fell on him too and big 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.240
 a wave of indignation where you deli top 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.830
 Peter Parker unfinished and ptr why are you 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.530
 trying to be like the dark 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.420
 Knight Nolan and others and fearing for fate 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.610
 new movie company management 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.800
 made a contribution and went on about 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.740
 splashing saliva fans can not 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.540
 was making a new regiment costume not canon 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.730
 Here you have the exact same costume as in 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.040
 comic book too many dark moments 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.410
 Here you have clowns over the edge for 1 and myself 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.840
 styles of competing on the part of the humor 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.020
 this is shailene woodley some kind of unpainted 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.180
 scary we cut it to hell with the truth 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.130
 then white explained it like that 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.170
 the decision was made not to distract 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.120
 viewers attention from tragedy and not 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.010
 Spider-man callous 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.900
 a freak that starts to stare 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.780
 on a neighbor with a hammer exactly before 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.940
 the death of his girlfriend and his refusal 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.450
 dying friend apparently not to do it 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.739
 soulless freak some you double 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.110
 citizen standards in 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.570
 further why sony makes the same mistake 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.850
 as in the third movie reimi shoves 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.459
 too many villains movie again 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.380
 there are two reasons for competition with marvel 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.580
 after all looking at the success of the avengers all 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.100
 now trying to create 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.920
 you universe with a bunch of characters turn 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.600
 by the way sit down and and the second reason 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.120
 toy money or rather income from 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.510
 sales of toys based on the movie more 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.310
 villains more figures more money however 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.060
 mutilated mts cyan aryas no matter 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.280
 confined 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.980
 from movie raised still dofiga scenes 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.080
 who in my opinion did it 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.820
 more logical somewhat deeper the presence of these 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.370
 the scenes would make some claims 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.920
 who were voiced to the bo plan 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.130
 new spider-man 2 link where 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.200
 link in the description so cut the whole 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.130
 the scene at the end where the live appears 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.169
 Richard Parker 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.630
 son is characterized by excellent acting 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.690
 Garfield game 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.419
 what did you want to explain wouldn't say that you 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.310
 want to say where you were seems to me 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.690
 here and it just cut right 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.090
 even though the moment of good has gone 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.740
 Andrew's performances , but the plane crashes 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.700
 was much better explained in 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.700
 cut scene 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.070
 why is it cut unclear flash thompson 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.080
 and also completely cut out of the picture 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.510
 it is not clear why he interfered with someone 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.420
 Well, and here is the mother of electro, here you can 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.400
 it was completely leave 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.380
 today is a special day you want me 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.000
 say something special to my 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.580
 special day and dork it already 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.620
 perfectly characterizes the hero makes him 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.320
 deeper and madness max becomes 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.180
 it is clear to the viewer that this is too gloomy 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.620
 we don't want to raise the issue 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.190
 nurture in our entertaining 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.560
 film we need to show it here it is 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.990
 root of all misfortunes max dillon but let's go 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.210
 Further apparently the scene of the murder of an employee 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.370
 morgue also seemed too cruel 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.950
 okay with dark moments everything is clear 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.320
 why cut out this scene remember i 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.480
 resenting how he knows 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.820
 how does this suit work if it is familiar 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.490
 with him nothing but that's where he comes from 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.260
 took part in its development this 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.320
 prototype of new military armor 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.320
 oh this is an amazingly wonderful movement 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.310
 joints this exoskeleton full 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.560
 life support and why not 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.390
 was leave in the film in general you still 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.610
 many interesting things to see in this scene 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.080
 completely unclear why from her 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.730
 got rid of there and 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.440
 about parents Peter and there is a small 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.480
 the explanation seems to be all detective 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.270
 parental component 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.280
 Parker pretty much simplified and they 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.500
 got rid of the great shots that 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.170
 demonstrate the transformation of harry in 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.680
 goblin in more detail essentially there was 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.960
 whole 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.600
 action scene that's grief and where's the goblin 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.080
 hangs lyuly all protection well you already 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.980
 know about imminent level soon 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:26.020
 security please do not reach these 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.480
 heights to fall deep 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.400
 like this is not completed constantly change 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.190
 the worst side and even in the process 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.230
 filming the script ruined the movie and now 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.510
 knowing the original script having looked 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.300
 cut scenes can be safely said that 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.730
 It could get a good movie and went 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.290
 unfortunately the worst blockbuster of this year 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.370
 and one of the worst movies about 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.560
 Spiderman 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.840
 the tape got so mixed 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.360
 reviews on her poured so much 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.490
 critics that sony is frightened 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.570
 failure of the third part moved her 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.850
 the premiere in 2016 for 2018 and their 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.680
 fears are not in vain since the second 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.620
 the film showed itself worse 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.870
 The first sony hope that in 2018 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.780
 passions subside not many are unhappy 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.150
 will forget their impressions of 2 paintings 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.610
 I really hope that they also work and 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.710
 above errors at the same time link to the movie with 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.050
 all cut scenes in the description 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.360
 by the way the trailer is also full of moments 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.000
 which was not in the film not 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.130
 cut scenes che generally for crap there 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.770
 happening the creators generally understood 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.200
 what exactly they want to blind alas but 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.940
 the second movie they ruined in principle 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.040
 worthy restart who wouldn't 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.770
 spoke but you had a falcon 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.770
 don't think about the signal yet
