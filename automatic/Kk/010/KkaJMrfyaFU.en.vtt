and I was doing research before this

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.770 
and I was doing research before this
video<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.490> was<00:04:38.120> on<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.300> computer<00:04:38.449> for<00:04:38.720> a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
video and I was on the computer for a

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.740 
video and I was on the computer for a
while<00:04:38.840> checking<00:04:39.530> stuff<00:04:39.770> out<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:41.180> found

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
while checking stuff out and I found

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.230 
while checking stuff out and I found
that<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.139> lot<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.680> foods<00:04:42.979> I<00:04:43.190> eat<00:04:43.430> are<00:04:43.669> foods

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
that a lot of the foods I eat are foods

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.559 
that a lot of the foods I eat are foods
that<00:04:44.569> claim<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.560> be<00:04:45.800> very<00:04:46.220> good<00:04:46.669> for<00:04:47.120> healthy

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
that claim to be very good for healthy

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.659 
that claim to be very good for healthy
hair<00:04:47.720> growth<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.349> that<00:04:48.530> might<00:04:48.800> also<00:04:49.069> be<00:04:49.280> why<00:04:49.639> my

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
hair growth so that might also be why my

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.800 
hair growth so that might also be why my
hair<00:04:50.150> tends<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.570> grow<00:04:52.120> faster<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.330> guess<00:04:53.539> and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
hair tends to grow faster I guess and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.080 
hair tends to grow faster I guess and
yeah<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:54.949> I<00:04:55.009> will<00:04:55.250> share<00:04:55.430> them<00:04:55.610> with<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.910> so

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
what's that from The Amanda Show I think

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.879 
what's that from The Amanda Show I think
it's<00:05:11.240> from<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.479> girls<00:05:11.659> room<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.169> I<00:05:12.500> knew<00:05:12.860> that

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
it's from the girls room and I knew that

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.860 
it's from the girls room and I knew that
eggs<00:05:13.370> contained<00:05:13.880> a<00:05:13.970> lot<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.150> protein<00:05:14.630> which<00:05:14.840> is

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
eggs contained a lot of protein which is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.249 
eggs contained a lot of protein which is
very<00:05:15.680> very<00:05:16.370> very<00:05:17.150> good<00:05:17.300> for<00:05:17.659> your<00:05:17.750> hair<00:05:18.020> your

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
very very very good for your hair your

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.839 
very very very good for your hair your
hair<00:05:18.289> is<00:05:18.440> pretty<00:05:18.560> much<00:05:18.740> composed<00:05:19.159> of<00:05:19.370> keratin

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
hair is pretty much composed of keratin

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.149 
hair is pretty much composed of keratin
and<00:05:20.240> keratin<00:05:20.720> is<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:20.930> protein<00:05:21.110> made<00:05:21.800> up<00:05:21.979> of

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
and keratin is a protein made up of

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.749 
and keratin is a protein made up of
amino<00:05:22.460> acids<00:05:22.909> so<00:05:23.599> when<00:05:24.229> you<00:05:24.409> are<00:05:24.620> eating<00:05:25.220> eggs

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
amino acids so when you are eating eggs

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.420 
amino acids so when you are eating eggs
and<00:05:26.240> you're<00:05:26.449> gaining<00:05:26.990> this<00:05:27.169> protein<00:05:27.620> then<00:05:28.220> it

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
and you're gaining this protein then it

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.240 
and you're gaining this protein then it
just<00:05:28.789> helps<00:05:29.479> to<00:05:29.800> helps<00:05:30.800> your<00:05:31.009> body<00:05:31.099> produce

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
just helps to helps your body produce

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.570 
just helps to helps your body produce
more<00:05:31.909> keratin<00:05:32.539> so<00:05:33.050> that<00:05:33.770> really<00:05:33.979> helps<00:05:34.340> out

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
more keratin so that really helps out

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.040 
more keratin so that really helps out

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
hair about once a week which is a lot

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.290 
hair about once a week which is a lot
less<00:06:45.290> than<00:06:45.320> I<00:06:45.500> think<00:06:45.560> a<00:06:45.770> lot<00:06:45.950> of<00:06:46.070> people<00:06:46.340> do<00:06:46.580> so

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
less than I think a lot of people do so

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.290 
less than I think a lot of people do so
that<00:06:47.510> could<00:06:48.290> have<00:06:48.410> factored<00:06:49.280> into<00:06:49.430> it<00:06:49.610> as<00:06:49.730> well

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
that could have factored into it as well
