start playing I'm just going to play
something<00:01:47.759> completely<00:01:48.060> random<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
something completely random just to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.630 
something completely random just to
demonstrate

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.320 

you<00:01:55.300> stop<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.600> whenever<00:01:55.870> and<00:01:56.229> then<00:01:57.190> turn<00:01:58.120> off

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
you stop it whenever and then turn off

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.960 
you stop it whenever and then turn off
record<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.140> then<00:02:00.100> play<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.400> back

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.550 

whatever<00:02:06.970> got<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.570> problem<00:02:07.810> with<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.319> if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
whatever got a problem with this is if

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.040 
whatever got a problem with this is if
you<00:02:08.710> don't<00:02:08.890> perfectly<00:02:09.310> like<00:02:09.929> coordinate<00:02:10.929> it

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
you don't perfectly like coordinate it

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.090 
you don't perfectly like coordinate it
then<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.350> get<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.590> might<00:02:11.709> get<00:02:11.830> like<00:02:11.980> an

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
then you get it might get like an

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500 
then you get it might get like an
overlap<00:02:12.520> like<00:02:12.730> if<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:13.000> would<00:02:13.180> just<00:02:13.330> kept

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
overlap like if I would just kept

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.750 
overlap like if I would just kept
playing<00:02:13.720> after<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.500> stopped<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.580> all<00:02:15.700> it
