 other animals as well as host to 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.960
 associated plants species that of what 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.619
 otherwise they would require a habitat

 who live in the foliage of trees 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.489
 we always act in defense of 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.590
 ecological balance being this the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.700
 hope for our ticos
