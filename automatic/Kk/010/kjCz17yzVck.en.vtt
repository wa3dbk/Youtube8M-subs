00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.870

 bar with buns or bananas 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.130
 it actually takes 20 30 full tanks 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.960
 maybe even 40 minutes to this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.370
 tank is emptied so far that the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.550

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.219
 Significant amounts of fat to burn 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
