today I will be showing you how to

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.670 
today I will be showing you how to
simulate<00:01:30.159> stamina<00:01:30.909> at<00:01:31.000> Minecraft<00:01:31.509> so<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.409> made

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
simulate stamina at Minecraft so I made

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.010 
simulate stamina at Minecraft so I made
a<00:01:32.710> video<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.460> week<00:01:33.640> ago<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:33.940> how<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.240> do<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.690> but

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
a video a week ago on how to do this but

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.260 
a video a week ago on how to do this but
I<00:01:35.049> completely<00:01:35.500> revamp<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.039> system<00:01:36.090> added<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
I completely revamp the system added the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.870 
I completely revamp the system added the
XP<00:01:37.630> bar<00:01:37.840> as<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.229> stamina<00:01:39.100> bar

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
XP bar as the stamina bar

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.340 
XP bar as the stamina bar
I'm<00:01:40.240> created<00:01:40.630> for<00:01:40.750> now<00:01:40.869> actually<00:01:41.110> wouldn't<00:01:41.259> be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
I'm created for now actually wouldn't be

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.499 
I'm created for now actually wouldn't be
able<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.619> see<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.130> consider<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.360> thing

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
able to see it and consider this thing

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.090 
able to see it and consider this thing
isn't<00:01:43.689> working<00:01:43.930> right<00:01:44.229> now<00:01:44.409> or<00:01:44.439> isn't<00:01:44.979> on

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
isn't working right now or isn't on

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.440 
isn't working right now or isn't on
right<00:01:45.340> now<00:01:45.520> then<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:45.880> wouldn't<00:01:46.090> go<00:01:46.149> see<00:01:46.360> it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
right now then you wouldn't go see it

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.440 
right now then you wouldn't go see it
anyways<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:48.130> gonna<00:01:48.280> go<00:01:48.490> ahead<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:49.060> show

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
anyways so I'm gonna go ahead and show

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.480 
anyways so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you<00:01:49.509> how<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.810> build<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:50.289> what<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.220> will<00:01:51.340> need

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
you how to build this what you will need

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.340 
you how to build this what you will need
is<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.729> redstone<00:01:52.119> clock<00:01:52.240> hooked<00:01:52.720> up<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:53.050> three

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
is a redstone clock hooked up to three

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.969 
is a redstone clock hooked up to three
command<00:01:53.740> blocks<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:55.479> uses<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:55.979> same

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
command blocks this uses the same

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.070 
command blocks this uses the same
function<00:01:57.399> Sat<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.119> one<00:01:58.569> centimeter<00:01:58.990> from

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
function Sat and one centimeter from

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.910 
function Sat and one centimeter from
scoreboard<00:01:59.770> so<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:01.060> one<00:02:01.299> tests<00:02:01.899> if<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.709> have

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
scoreboard so this one tests if you have

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.859 
scoreboard so this one tests if you have
walked<00:02:03.250> more<00:02:03.670> than<00:02:03.729> thirty<00:02:04.090> five<00:02:04.270> centimeters

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
walked more than thirty five centimeters

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.910 
walked more than thirty five centimeters
up<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.200> 70<00:02:05.530> centimeters<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:07.299> one<00:02:07.769> tests<00:02:08.769> if

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
up to 70 centimeters this one tests if

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.529 
up to 70 centimeters this one tests if
you<00:02:09.130> walk<00:02:09.429> from<00:02:09.640> zero<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.090> thirty<00:02:10.299> four

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
you walk from zero to thirty four

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.750 
you walk from zero to thirty four
centimeters<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.319> then<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.430> sets<00:02:12.670> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
centimeters and then this just sets it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.330 
centimeters and then this just sets it
back<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:13.060> zero<00:02:13.330> once<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.170> whole<00:02:14.980> entire

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
back to zero once the whole entire

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.930 
back to zero once the whole entire
process<00:02:15.790> has<00:02:16.120> ended<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> when<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.400> tests<00:02:18.850> to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
process has ended so when it tests to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.120 
process has ended so when it tests to
see<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.360> you've<00:02:19.480> walked<00:02:19.750> over<00:02:20.380> 35

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
see that you've walked over 35

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.520 
see that you've walked over 35
centimeters<00:02:21.970> then<00:02:22.660> they'll<00:02:22.930> activate<00:02:23.260> this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
centimeters then they'll activate this

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.470 
centimeters then they'll activate this
command<00:02:23.920> block<00:02:24.070> which<00:02:24.430> sets<00:02:24.790> your<00:02:25.030> walk<00:02:25.269> to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
command block which sets your walk to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.610 
command block which sets your walk to
zero<00:02:25.750> again<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.820> gives<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:28.150> 10<00:02:28.600> XP<00:02:29.019> points<00:02:29.470> or

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
zero again and gives you 10 XP points or

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.560 
zero again and gives you 10 XP points or
XP<00:02:30.400> orbs<00:02:30.760> or<00:02:30.880> whatever<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.150> want<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.299> call<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
XP orbs or whatever you want to call it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.530 
XP orbs or whatever you want to call it
it<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:32.560> goes<00:02:33.040> around<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.670> powers<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.239> so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
it then goes around and powers this so

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.960 
it then goes around and powers this so
turns<00:02:34.870> off<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.680> comparator<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:36.940> I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
turns off the comparator this is what I

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.880 
turns off the comparator this is what I
had<00:02:37.090> trouble<00:02:37.420> with<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.750> took<00:02:37.870> like<00:02:38.140> half<00:02:38.410> an

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
had trouble with it took like half an

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.789 
had trouble with it took like half an
hour<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.160> figure<00:02:39.459> out<00:02:39.609> how<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.799> and

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
hour to figure out how to do this and

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.830 
hour to figure out how to do this and
then<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.280> one<00:02:42.489> over<00:02:42.519> here<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.359> just<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
then this one over here is just the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.430 
then this one over here is just the
opposite<00:02:44.200> if<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.280> walked<00:02:45.549> less<00:02:45.970> than<00:02:46.440> 34

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
opposite if you have walked less than 34

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.860 
opposite if you have walked less than 34
centimeters<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.790> I'll<00:02:48.970> power<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:49.420> go<00:02:49.690> back

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
centimeters then I'll power this go back

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.220 
centimeters then I'll power this go back
to<00:02:50.019> zero<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.850> lose<00:02:52.120> two<00:02:52.329> levels<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.900> just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
to zero and you lose two levels I just

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.289 
to zero and you lose two levels I just
put<00:02:53.350> two<00:02:53.500> there<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.769> so<00:02:54.100> just<00:02:54.370> gets<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:55.000> rid

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
put two there and so just gets all rid

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.190 
put two there and so just gets all rid
of<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.690> them<00:02:55.780> completely

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
of all of them completely

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.069 
of all of them completely
now<00:02:56.560> after<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:57.070> take<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.310> delay<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:58.269> will<00:02:58.329> tell

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
now after one take of delay it will tell

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.360 
now after one take of delay it will tell
you<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.230> make<00:02:59.350> sure<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.769> don't<00:02:59.890> run<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.250> up

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
you to make sure you don't run so up

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.520 
you to make sure you don't run so up
here<00:03:00.609> is<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> time

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
here is a time

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.910 
here is a time
and<00:03:01.620> get<00:03:02.490> rid<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.850> your<00:03:03.570> levels<00:03:03.930> completely<00:03:04.470> so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and get rid of your levels completely so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.040 
and get rid of your levels completely so
now<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.580> very<00:03:05.970> customizable<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.930> like

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
now this is very customizable just like

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.550 
now this is very customizable just like
glass<00:03:07.260> design<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:09.150> change<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.230> redstone

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
glass design you can change the redstone

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.350 
glass design you can change the redstone
cocktail<00:03:10.950> very<00:03:11.280> long<00:03:11.460> or<00:03:11.640> have<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.790> resort<00:03:12.210> you

whenever you lose out to be basically

whenever you lose out to be basically
wanna<00:03:16.920> test<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:18.660> couldn't<00:03:18.930> change<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:19.320> much

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
wanna test you couldn't change how much

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.960 
wanna test you couldn't change how much
have<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.770> walk<00:03:20.010> or<00:03:20.220> how<00:03:20.340> much<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.610> don't<00:03:20.790> have

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
have to walk or how much you don't have

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.180 
have to walk or how much you don't have
to<00:03:21.120> walk<00:03:21.300> for<00:03:21.540> let's<00:03:21.720> get<00:03:21.900> active<00:03:22.080> we<00:03:23.040> could

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
to walk for let's get active we could

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.430 
to walk for let's get active we could
change<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.610> debuff<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.450> one<00:03:25.200> thing<00:03:25.350> you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
change the debuff and one thing you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.930 
change the debuff and one thing you
might<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.620> noticed<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:26.610> happens

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
might have noticed is that what happens

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.540 
might have noticed is that what happens
if<00:03:27.120> you're<00:03:27.270> running<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.900> jumping<00:03:28.490> now<00:03:29.490> you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
if you're running and jumping now you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.380 
if you're running and jumping now you
could<00:03:29.760> also<00:03:29.910> hook<00:03:30.240> up<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:31.230> stat<00:03:31.950> jump<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.120> if

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
could also hook up to a stat jump so if

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.790 
could also hook up to a stat jump so if
you<00:03:33.510> jump<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.840> certain<00:03:34.020> amount<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.320> times<00:03:34.530> it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
you jump in certain amount of times it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680 
you jump in certain amount of times it
would<00:03:34.860> also<00:03:35.100> activate<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.850> mechanism<00:03:36.480> and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
would also activate this mechanism and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.420 
would also activate this mechanism and
you<00:03:36.720> could<00:03:37.050> actually<00:03:37.200> make<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.620> go<00:03:37.709> faster<00:03:38.220> by

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
you could actually make it go faster by

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.640 
you could actually make it go faster by
hooking<00:03:38.700> up<00:03:38.880> both<00:03:39.030> them<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.050> run<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
hooking up both them so if you run a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.020 
hooking up both them so if you run a
certain<00:03:40.920> amount<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.160> distance<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.820> jump

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
certain amount of distance and you jump

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.360 
certain amount of distance and you jump
at<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> same<00:03:42.330> time<00:03:42.570> your<00:03:43.080> stamina<00:03:43.380> will<00:03:43.709> go<00:03:44.010> up

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
at the same time your stamina will go up

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.020 
at the same time your stamina will go up
faster<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.650> pretty<00:03:46.860> much<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.489> hope

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
faster so that is pretty much it I hope

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.699 
faster so that is pretty much it I hope
you<00:03:48.150> guys<00:03:48.209> enjoyed<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:48.840> redstone<00:03:49.170> invention
