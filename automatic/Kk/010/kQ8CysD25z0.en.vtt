it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.570> strange<00:01:52.140> place<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> build<00:01:53.130> such

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it's a very strange place to build such

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.490

a<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.649> crazy<00:01:55.649> apartments<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.880> so

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I thought they would have built it at

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
I thought they would have built it at
much<00:02:00.210> better<00:02:00.509> place<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.960> downtown<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
