 Today I want to give you a book 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.940
 Imagine that the reader takes on 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.250
 an expedition to the land of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.860
 nature spirits of elves fairies and kobolde 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 and this book wrote 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.230
 the park is called fairy dust my life 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.420
 with the elves 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.320
