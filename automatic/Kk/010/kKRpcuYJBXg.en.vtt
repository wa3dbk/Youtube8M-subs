 kevin shea countryside 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.430
 I can not wait to see the snow-covered hills 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.860
 good to have left the heat behind 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.169
 humidity 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.870
 and the mosquitoes 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.220
 this is life 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.260
 October 14th 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 this is the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 the colors of the geese walk through the woods this morning of a deer 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.390
 what a beautiful animal looks like its horns like a crown is undoubtedly the king of 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.170
 forest 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.750
 Canada is paradise think that suffering so many years 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.750
 in that hell that is holy faith 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.950

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.910
 what a joy 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.200
 I woke up everything was covered in snow it looked like a postcard came out 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 to shovel the snow and I was 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.060
 So happy that I roll over her 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.260
 then we play a snowball war with the neighbors 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.160
 jackelin to live here 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.120
 the motor grader step clean the street 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.620
 December 22th 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.840
 it snowed again last night 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.140
 When I finished hitting the motor grader again 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.970
 and again in front of getting married not all dirty snow 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.400
 I'm a little tired of shoveling snow 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.320
 she gave me my cousin santa fe and went with the family to the spa of guadeloupe 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.620
 December 25th 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620
 Merry Christmas 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.620
 I have my hands full of fell because of the shovel 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.959
 I think the cuckold of the motor grader 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.450
 I went to him and as soon as it was over, he came back and filled me with snow all 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.499
 again 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.499
 I shit on the motor grader 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.489
 and in it but what was managed 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.919
 December 31 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.159
 the boludo of the news became wrong again 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.999
 instead of 30 centimeters fell 98 serbia 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.339
 here there is no way to celebrate the new year nobody can leave his house 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.889
 the snow tip 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.289
 I'm tired and I feel very alone 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.189
 I called my cousin again and the queer did not want to attend because he was in the 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.079
 pool 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.919
 surely after basing a piglet in the yard and I here without being able to poke the 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.199
 nose 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.559
 February 20 today I went out to go to the supermarket 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.229
 on the way he was granted a fucking deer and trying to activate it 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.549
 I ate a tree market at that animal point 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.669
 the arrangement of the car will leave me a luke and a half 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.650
 I am convinced that God wanted the deer to carry some 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.029
 the hunters should have killed him 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:29.349
 March 2 yesterday I slipped on the ice and I broke a prawn 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.499

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.499

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.439

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.439

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.750

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.559

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.769
 15 th of May 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.469

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:14.849
 lonely 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.709
 tomorrow I return for holy faith I do not see the time to arrive to be able to enjoy 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.759
 moisture, heat and mosquitoes 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.060
