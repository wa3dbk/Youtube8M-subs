00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
is a faster way to do that and that is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
is a faster way to do that and that is
by<00:00:42.450> pouring<00:00:42.899> boiling<00:00:43.440> water<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.700> washed

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
by pouring boiling water over the washed

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.350 
by pouring boiling water over the washed
pinto<00:00:45.750> beans<00:00:46.160> they<00:00:47.160> plump<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:48.030> fast

pinto beans they plump up really fast

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
pinto beans they plump up really fast
and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> wait<00:00:49.890> overnight<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and you don't have to wait overnight you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
and you don't have to wait overnight you
can<00:00:50.940> cook<00:00:51.180> them<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.570> you're<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.989> hurry<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
can cook them if you're in a hurry so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.660 
can cook them if you're in a hurry so
that's<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.699> i<00:00:53.730> did<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.390> pinto<00:00:54.930> beans

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
that's what i did with these pinto beans

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.479 
that's what i did with these pinto beans
they<00:00:56.670> cooked<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.270> an<00:00:57.510> hour<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
they cooked for about an hour and

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
they cooked for about an hour and
remember<00:00:59.489> don't<00:01:00.300> salt<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:01.109> until<00:01:01.770> you're

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
remember don't salt them until you're

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
remember don't salt them until you're
finished<00:01:02.190> cooking<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.600> important

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
finished cooking that's really important

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
finished cooking that's really important
because<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.820> toughen<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.450> up

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
because if you do can toughen them up

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.100 
because if you do can toughen them up
and<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.140> take<00:01:07.320> forever<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:10.020> I'm
