00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
first and then I obviously would start

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.319 
first and then I obviously would start

all plastic and so a lot of people lean
towards<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.230> because<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
towards this just because of the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
it's the same ceramic yep conical number

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.180 
it's the same ceramic yep conical number
the<00:03:26.840> difference<00:03:27.230> is<00:03:27.380> between<00:03:27.530> these<00:03:27.920> other

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
the difference is between these other

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.340 
the difference is between these other
than<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.519> material<00:03:29.030> of<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.209> exterior<00:03:29.510> this

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
than the material of the exterior this

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.090 
than the material of the exterior this
has<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.769> smaller<00:03:31.160> volume<00:03:31.639> that<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.910> can

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
has a smaller volume that it can

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.940 
has a smaller volume that it can
for<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.000> ground<00:03:34.210> coffee<00:03:34.450> as<00:03:35.140> well<00:03:35.470> as<00:03:35.650> for<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
for the ground coffee as well as for the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.300 
for the ground coffee as well as for the
holding<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.840> comes<00:03:41.290> off<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.770> like<00:03:41.890> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
holding this comes off just like that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.840 
holding this comes off just like that
that's<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.540> that's<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.870> pro<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.530> con<00:03:44.850> if

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
that's it that's a pro and a con if

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.790 
that's it that's a pro and a con if
you're<00:03:46.000> not<00:03:46.150> precise<00:03:46.540> enough<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:47.380> might<00:03:47.500> find

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
you're not precise enough you might find

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.300 
you're not precise enough you might find

mm-hm so go ahead and turn it the other

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.290 
mm-hm so go ahead and turn it the other
way<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:43.890> other<00:04:44.890> fine<00:04:45.340> Branton<00:04:45.820> that's<00:04:46.030> that's

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
way the other fine Branton that's that's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.060 
way the other fine Branton that's that's
probably<00:04:46.660> good<00:04:46.810> right<00:04:46.990> there<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.830> go<00:04:47.890> that's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
probably good right there you go that's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.830 
probably good right there you go that's
that's<00:04:48.730> more<00:04:48.940> than<00:04:49.120> good<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.360> I'll<00:04:49.450> back<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.660> up

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
that's more than good so I'll back it up

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.070 
that's more than good so I'll back it up
just<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.260> tad<00:04:50.730> and<00:04:51.730> on<00:04:52.420> this<00:04:52.600> piece<00:04:52.810> basically

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
just a tad and on this piece basically

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.910 
just a tad and on this piece basically
just<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:54.460> there<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.970> lock<00:04:55.660> it<00:04:55.840> in<00:04:55.990> okay<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:56.740> that

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
just is there to lock it in okay so that

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.310 
just is there to lock it in okay so that
that<00:04:57.520> now<00:04:57.760> prevents<00:04:58.480> this<00:04:58.600> from<00:04:58.660> moving<00:04:58.990> so

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
that now prevents this from moving so

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.710 
that now prevents this from moving so
you're<00:04:59.680> denying<00:04:59.950> setting<00:05:00.430> won't<00:05:00.910> change<00:05:01.300> then

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
you're denying setting won't change then

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.750 
you're denying setting won't change then
you<00:05:01.750> put<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.050> lid<00:05:02.260> on<00:05:02.440> aniss<00:05:03.310> little<00:05:03.550> piece

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
you put the lid on aniss little piece

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.820 
you put the lid on aniss little piece
screws<00:05:04.030> down<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.230> know<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.410> takes<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:05.710> it

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
screws down so you know it takes so it

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.260 
screws down so you know it takes so it
takes<00:05:06.100> a<00:05:06.190> little<00:05:06.340> bit<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.550> play<00:05:06.790> around<00:05:06.940> but

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
takes a little bit of play around but

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.160 
takes a little bit of play around but
it's<00:05:07.570> pretty<00:05:07.810> easy

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
it's pretty easy

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.810 
it's pretty easy
how<00:05:08.530> are<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:08.860> gonna<00:05:08.980> change<00:05:09.280> your<00:05:09.370> time<00:05:09.640> you
