 is just generating a good 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.800
 amount of cloudiness that could 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.690
 give in the next period to 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120
 Precipitations that go from strong to very

 our territory where there is an area 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.610
 very very unstable that we will have 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.289

 So much speed slightly 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.010
 low solar radiation ceiling and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.840
 temperatures are oscillating between 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.760

 also cloudiness as 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.519
