00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
of maokai do you think that he's just a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.470 
of maokai do you think that he's just a
really<00:00:15.980> Opie<00:00:16.280> top<00:00:16.460> laner<00:00:16.700> or<00:00:16.910> do<00:00:17.240> you<00:00:17.330> think

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
really Opie top laner or do you think

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.790 
really Opie top laner or do you think
that<00:00:17.600> he<00:00:17.720> really<00:00:17.930> suits<00:00:18.140> your<00:00:18.289> guys<00:00:18.440> display

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
that he really suits your guys display

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.070 
that he really suits your guys display
style<00:00:19.070> why<00:00:19.220> do<00:00:19.280> you<00:00:19.460> always<00:00:19.580> pick<00:00:19.820> him<00:00:20.050> um

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
style why do you always pick him um

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.170 
style why do you always pick him um
maokai<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:21.890> probably<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.550> strongest<00:00:22.700> tank

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
maokai is probably the strongest tank

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.870 
maokai is probably the strongest tank
right<00:00:23.360> now<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:23.810> because<00:00:24.800> we<00:00:25.220> Lane<00:00:25.430> swap<00:00:25.640> so

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
right now and because we Lane swap so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.670 
right now and because we Lane swap so
much<00:00:26.060> she's<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:26.360> really<00:00:26.780> strong<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:27.110> link<00:00:27.440> swap

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
much she's a really strong a link swap

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.640 
much she's a really strong a link swap
so<00:00:28.180> we<00:00:29.180> have<00:00:29.450> a<00:00:29.480> really<00:00:29.930> high<00:00:30.230> priority<00:00:30.620> for

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
so we have a really high priority for

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.790 
so we have a really high priority for
him<00:00:30.860> right<00:00:30.950> now<00:00:31.360> okay<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.540> um<00:00:32.989> recently<00:00:33.379> there

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
have been a lot of toppling hecarim x'

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.549 
have been a lot of toppling hecarim x'
and<00:00:35.480> they<00:00:35.570> haven't<00:00:35.780> really<00:00:36.020> been<00:00:36.050> doing<00:00:36.440> as

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
and they haven't really been doing as

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.169 
and they haven't really been doing as
well<00:00:36.710> i<00:00:36.770> know<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.489> guys<00:00:37.610> recent<00:00:38.059> like

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
well i know that you guys recent like

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.939 
well i know that you guys recent like
you<00:00:38.359> have<00:00:38.539> played<00:00:38.809> him<00:00:38.960> mid<00:00:39.170> lane<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.499> that's

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
you have played him mid lane and that's

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.020 
you have played him mid lane and that's
worked<00:00:40.129> out<00:00:40.190> really<00:00:40.249> well<00:00:40.460> for<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:40.820> do<00:00:40.940> you

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
worked out really well for you do you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.880 
worked out really well for you do you
think<00:00:41.179> that<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.600> top<00:00:41.929> hecarim<00:00:42.350> is<00:00:42.589> not

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
think that the top hecarim is not

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.860 
think that the top hecarim is not
working<00:00:43.640> good<00:00:43.909> because<00:00:44.210> it's<00:00:44.329> not<00:00:44.510> good<00:00:44.690> in

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
working good because it's not good in

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.000 
working good because it's not good in
that<00:00:44.989> lane<00:00:45.199> or<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:45.559> think<00:00:45.710> that<00:00:45.859> people

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
that lane or do you think that people

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.739 
that lane or do you think that people
aren't<00:00:46.219> taking<00:00:46.609> advantage<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.210> him<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:47.570> what

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
aren't taking advantage of him like what

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:48.790 
aren't taking advantage of him like what
do<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:47.839> think<00:00:47.929> is<00:00:48.109> going<00:00:48.260> wrong<00:00:48.440> with<00:00:48.499> top

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
do you think is going wrong with top

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.299 
do you think is going wrong with top
backroom

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
backroom

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.419 
backroom
I<00:00:49.339> think<00:00:50.329> top<00:00:50.899> hakam's<00:00:51.530> actually<00:00:52.190> really

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
I think top hakam's actually really

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.479 
I think top hakam's actually really
strong<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:54.350> competitive<00:00:54.949> it's<00:00:55.100> kind<00:00:55.399> of

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
strong but in competitive it's kind of

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.669 
strong but in competitive it's kind of
hard<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:55.940> use<00:00:56.089> incorrectly<00:00:56.780> like<00:00:57.199> he's<00:00:57.409> really

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
hard to use incorrectly like he's really

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.149 
hard to use incorrectly like he's really
playing<00:00:57.859> dominant<00:00:58.309> champion<00:00:58.539> but<00:00:59.859> in<00:01:00.859> terms

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
playing dominant champion but in terms

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.040 
playing dominant champion but in terms
of<00:01:01.339> teamfights<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.239> stuff<00:01:02.539> if<00:01:02.690> he<00:01:02.780> doesn't

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
of teamfights and stuff if he doesn't

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.380 
of teamfights and stuff if he doesn't
have<00:01:03.170> those<00:01:03.289> items<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.949> he'll<00:01:04.430> die<00:01:04.640> instantly

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
have those items and he'll die instantly

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.899 
have those items and he'll die instantly
so<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:06.320> he<00:01:06.470> ever<00:01:06.500> falls<00:01:06.890> behind<00:01:07.040> these<00:01:07.370> kind<00:01:07.850> of

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
so if he ever falls behind these kind of

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.709 
so if he ever falls behind these kind of
useless<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:08.900> he's<00:01:09.110> still<00:01:09.380> not<00:01:09.620> a<00:01:09.650> bad<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:11.420> I

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
useless but he's still not a bad and I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.060 
useless but he's still not a bad and I
know<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.170> guys<00:01:12.380> have<00:01:12.560> blast<00:01:12.829> shadow
