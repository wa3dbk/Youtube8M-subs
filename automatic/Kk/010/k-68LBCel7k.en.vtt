00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
this is yellow train it's what I use

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.100 
this is yellow train it's what I use
pretty<00:00:02.399> much<00:00:02.520> exclusively<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.419> fight<00:00:03.659> algae

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
pretty much exclusively to fight algae

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.420 
pretty much exclusively to fight algae
and<00:00:04.230> all<00:00:04.350> my<00:00:04.500> accounts<00:00:04.770> I've<00:00:05.009> using<00:00:05.279> for

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
and all my accounts I've using for

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.080 
and all my accounts I've using for
several<00:00:05.549> years<00:00:05.940> it's<00:00:06.120> very<00:00:06.330> effective

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.810 

you<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.809> all<00:00:12.930> see<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.170> swim<00:00:13.440> Treen<00:00:13.830> which<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
you can all see you swim Treen which is

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.609 
you can all see you swim Treen which is
the<00:00:14.880> copper<00:00:15.180> base<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.840> I'd<00:00:15.959> like<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.320> use<00:00:16.439> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the copper base but I'd like to use the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.200 
the copper base but I'd like to use the
yellow<00:00:16.680> train<00:00:17.070> first<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.090> usually

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
yellow train first and it's usually

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
yellow train first and it's usually
effective<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> generally<00:00:19.650> don't<00:00:19.770> use<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
effective and I generally don't use this

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.920 
effective and I generally don't use this
and<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:20.610> absolutely<00:00:21.090> necessary<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.810> is

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
and that's absolutely necessary which is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.359 
and that's absolutely necessary which is
rarely<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:22.950> over<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> yellow

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
rarely do I use this one over the yellow

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.700 
rarely do I use this one over the yellow
train<00:00:23.759> okay<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> couple<00:00:24.900> things<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.320> note<00:00:25.529> when

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
train okay a couple things to note when

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.780 
train okay a couple things to note when
using<00:00:25.890> yellow<00:00:26.160> train

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
using yellow train

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.880 
using yellow train
it<00:00:27.090> will<00:00:27.300> eat<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> chlorine<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.619> pool<00:00:28.859> is

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it will eat the chlorine in your pool is

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.820 
it will eat the chlorine in your pool is
actually<00:00:29.570> bromine<00:00:30.570> sodium<00:00:31.170> bromine<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> the

actually bromine sodium bromine is the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.680 
actually bromine sodium bromine is the
same<00:00:32.070> thing<00:00:32.519> that<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> tablets

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
same thing that they use in the tablets

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.170 
same thing that they use in the tablets
and<00:00:33.900> hot<00:00:34.230> tubs<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.519> side<00:00:35.699> effects<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and hot tubs one of the side effects of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.060 
and hot tubs one of the side effects of
course<00:00:36.449> is<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.379> used<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> point<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:37.949> your

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
course is that it used to point out your

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.350 
course is that it used to point out your
pool<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.519> got<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> make<00:00:38.910> sure<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.239> use

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
pool so you got to make sure you use

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.610 
pool so you got to make sure you use
chlorine<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.019> use<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.110 

I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> also<00:00:47.550> make<00:00:47.760> sure<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
I'm going to also make sure there's a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520 
I'm going to also make sure there's a
good<00:00:48.210> chlorine<00:00:48.539> level<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> pool<00:00:49.199> when<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
good chlorine level in the pool when you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
good chlorine level in the pool when you
start<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> process

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
start it the process

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
start it the process
if<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.360> shock<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> pool<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.770> some

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
if not you can shock the pool with some

cleaning level up you want to start with
a<00:00:56.820> good<00:00:56.940> chlorine<00:00:57.269> level<00:00:57.600> before<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.019> start

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a good chlorine level before you start

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
a good chlorine level before you start
using<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.620> yellow<00:00:58.769> train<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.339> your<00:00:59.460> pool<00:00:59.640> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
using the yellow train in your pool so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
using the yellow train in your pool so
chocolate<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.839> that's<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.949> good

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
chocolate if we need to that's a good

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
chocolate if we need to that's a good
level<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.399> chlorine<00:01:02.610> right<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.659> zero

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
level of chlorine right now it will zero

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
level of chlorine right now it will zero
out<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> chlorine<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.830> pool<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.489> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
out the chlorine in this pool with this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
out the chlorine in this pool with this
treatment<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> brush<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> algae

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
treatment we're going to brush the algae

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
treatment we're going to brush the algae
I'm<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> small<00:01:08.540> algae<00:01:09.540> brush

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I'm going to use this small algae brush

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
I'm going to use this small algae brush
so<00:01:10.440> this<00:01:10.590> pool<00:01:10.770> has<00:01:10.920> some<00:01:11.100> yellow<00:01:11.280> algae

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
so this pool has some yellow algae

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.749 
so this pool has some yellow algae
basically<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.290> area<00:01:14.009> here<00:01:14.220> by<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.399> tile

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
basically in this area here by the tile

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.249 
basically in this area here by the tile
line<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.899> in<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.500> small<00:01:16.649> step<00:01:17.100> area

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
line and in this little small step area

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
line and in this little small step area
you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.350> also<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.940> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you can also see here in this also this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.150 
you can also see here in this also this
side<00:01:21.450> area<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.679> going<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:22.920> ahead<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
side area I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.719 
side area I'm going to go ahead and
brush<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.490> out

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
brush that out

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.100 
brush that out
okay<00:01:24.060> went<00:01:24.270> ahead<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.539> brush<00:01:24.690> down<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:24.990> can

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
okay went ahead and brush down you can

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.570 
okay went ahead and brush down you can
still<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.800> yellow<00:01:26.250> residue

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
still see a little bit of yellow residue

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
still see a little bit of yellow residue
depends<00:01:27.149> on<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.330> aggressive<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.840> algae<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
depends on how aggressive the algae is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.570 
depends on how aggressive the algae is
and<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.530> much<00:01:28.649> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.800> actually<00:01:29.009> brush<00:01:29.310> off

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
and how much you can actually brush off

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.639 
and how much you can actually brush off
at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> first<00:01:30.149> treatment<00:01:30.660> I'm<00:01:31.440> gonna<00:01:31.590> go

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
at the first treatment I'm gonna go

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.160 
at the first treatment I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> force<00:01:32.039> them<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> cap<00:01:33.110> okay<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
ahead and force them in the cap okay so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.719 
ahead and force them in the cap okay so
I<00:01:34.289> have<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> cap<00:01:34.679> foulness<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.520> amount

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I have the cap foulness is the amount

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.059 
I have the cap foulness is the amount
I'm<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> actually<00:01:36.360> use<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:37.470> treat<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
I'm going to actually use to treat the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.950 
I'm going to actually use to treat the
algae<00:01:38.789> in<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.210> area<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.690> pool

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
algae in this little area of the pool

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.110 
algae in this little area of the pool
but<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:40.950> big<00:01:41.100> area

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.030 

I<00:01:49.240> want<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.870> do<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:50.050> sprinkle<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.830> yellow

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
I want to do is sprinkle the yellow

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.330 
I want to do is sprinkle the yellow
screen<00:01:51.430> over<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.880> spot<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> algae<00:01:53.020> zap

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
screen over the spot for the algae zap

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.260 
screen over the spot for the algae zap
immediately<00:01:54.340> come<00:01:54.490> right<00:01:54.640> behind<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:55.090> with

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
immediately come right behind it with

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.560 
immediately come right behind it with
liquid<00:01:55.720> chlorine<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.290> pour<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
liquid chlorine and pour it in and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.910 
liquid chlorine and pour it in and
you'll<00:01:58.720> actually<00:01:58.810> see<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.290> water<00:01:59.410> change

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
you'll actually see the water change

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.500 
you'll actually see the water change
color<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:00.760> see<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.150> actually

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
color you can see that it actually

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.080 
color you can see that it actually
turned<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:02.050> bright<00:02:02.740> yellow<00:02:02.920> color<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.820> area

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
turned a bright yellow color in the area

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.680 
turned a bright yellow color in the area
where<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.300> poured<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:05.440> chemicals<00:02:06.120> I'm<00:02:07.120> gonna

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
where I poured the chemicals I'm gonna

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.180 
where I poured the chemicals I'm gonna
do<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.870> same<00:02:08.050> thing<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.320> this<00:02:08.440> side<00:02:08.770> where

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
do the same thing on this side where

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.300 
do the same thing on this side where
they<00:02:09.280> have<00:02:09.430> this<00:02:09.550> algae<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:12.040> I'll<00:02:12.130> go<00:02:12.220> ahead

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
they have this algae and I'll go ahead

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.770 
they have this algae and I'll go ahead
and<00:02:12.490> pour<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.760> means<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.240> whole<00:02:13.360> gallon<00:02:13.720> of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and pour that means a whole gallon of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.810 
and pour that means a whole gallon of
chlorine<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.130> mix<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.430> with<00:02:15.460> this<00:02:15.640> yellow

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
chlorine and I mix it with this yellow

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.890 
chlorine and I mix it with this yellow
string<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:16.630> area<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.630> again<00:02:19.780> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
string here in this area and again you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.950 
string here in this area and again you
can<00:02:20.020> see<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.230> chemical<00:02:20.500> reaction<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
can see the chemical reaction as the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.260 
can see the chemical reaction as the
sodium<00:02:22.960> bromide<00:02:23.110> yellow<00:02:24.040> train<00:02:24.460> mixes<00:02:25.060> with

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
sodium bromide yellow train mixes with

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.330 
sodium bromide yellow train mixes with
the<00:02:25.450> chlorine<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.770> gives<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.070> yellow

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the chlorine and gives it that yellow

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.050 
the chlorine and gives it that yellow
tint<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> very<00:02:30.370> strong<00:02:30.640> chemical

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
tint and this is a very strong chemical

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.640 
tint and this is a very strong chemical
so<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> sufficient<00:02:31.660> amount<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.470> kill

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
so that was a sufficient amount to kill

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.990 
so that was a sufficient amount to kill
the<00:02:32.770> algae<00:02:32.920> with<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.460> one<00:02:33.610> gallon<00:02:33.760> of

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the algae with the one gallon of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.240 
the algae with the one gallon of
chlorine<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.350> again<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.620> want<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.830> use<00:02:35.890> fresh

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
chlorine and again you want to use fresh

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.830 
chlorine and again you want to use fresh
chlorine<00:02:36.640> from<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.880> pool<00:02:37.090> store<00:02:37.330> nothing<00:02:37.510> from

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
chlorine from a pool store nothing from

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.050 
chlorine from a pool store nothing from
Walmart<00:02:38.290> or<00:02:38.710> Home<00:02:39.010> Depot<00:02:39.190> type<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.910> don't

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
Walmart or Home Depot type you don't

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.280 
Walmart or Home Depot type you don't
know<00:02:40.120> how<00:02:40.240> long<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.540> been<00:02:40.570> on<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.810> shelf<00:02:41.110> so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
know how long it's been on the shelf so

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.830 
know how long it's been on the shelf so
go<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> your<00:02:41.680> local<00:02:41.770> pool<00:02:42.040> store<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> fresh

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
go to your local pool store get a fresh

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.440 
go to your local pool store get a fresh
case<00:02:43.840> or<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> gallon<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.710> chlorine<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.490> for

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
case or a gallon of chlorine and for

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.610 
case or a gallon of chlorine and for
weekly<00:02:46.750> maintenance<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.200> could<00:02:47.320> put<00:02:47.440> about

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
weekly maintenance you could put about

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.380 
weekly maintenance you could put about
this<00:02:47.770> amount<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.280> there<00:02:48.520> which<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:49.030> small

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
this amount in there which is a small

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.630 
this amount in there which is a small
amount<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.770> yellow<00:02:50.890> tree<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.250> every<00:02:51.400> week

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
amount of the yellow tree and every week

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.100 
amount of the yellow tree and every week
and<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:51.910> will<00:02:52.090> help<00:02:52.240> keep<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.630> algae<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:52.990> of

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
and that will help keep the algae out of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.320 
and that will help keep the algae out of
your<00:02:53.200> pool<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.640> see<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.970> chemical

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
your pool and you can see the chemical

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.949 
your pool and you can see the chemical
reaction<00:02:55.660> has<00:02:55.810> dissipated<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:57.010> fading

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
reaction has dissipated and it's fading

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.120 
reaction has dissipated and it's fading
and<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.110> had<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> more<00:02:59.440> extensive<00:02:59.709> area<00:03:00.070> of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and if you had a more extensive area of

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.530 
and if you had a more extensive area of
algae<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.730> would<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.090> double<00:03:01.239> up<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
algae you would have to double up the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.060 
algae you would have to double up the
treatment<00:03:01.870> maybe<00:03:02.260> another<00:03:02.470> gallon<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.860> liquid

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
treatment maybe another gallon of liquid

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.430 
treatment maybe another gallon of liquid
chlorine<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.760> another<00:03:04.020> Capital<00:03:05.020> yellow

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
chlorine and another Capital yellow

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.370 
chlorine and another Capital yellow
train<00:03:06.270> just<00:03:07.270> used<00:03:07.480> your<00:03:07.570> judgment<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
train just used your judgment as you

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.680 
train just used your judgment as you
measure<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.070> pool

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.480 

and<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> very<00:03:17.130> effective<00:03:17.460> way

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
and so this is a very effective way

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.850 
and so this is a very effective way

and I use I've been using for several

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.480 
and I use I've been using for several
years<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> only<00:03:24.160> thing<00:03:24.250> I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
years and this is the only thing I

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.330 
years and this is the only thing I
basically<00:03:24.910> use<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.660> eliminate<00:03:26.650> algae<00:03:27.070> in<00:03:27.280> the
