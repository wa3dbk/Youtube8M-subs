committed any kind of tragedies it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.389 
committed any kind of tragedies it
didn't<00:00:35.399> flow<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> scenes<00:00:37.620> led<00:00:38.219> into

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
didn't flow the way the scenes led into

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
didn't flow the way the scenes led into
each<00:00:38.640> other<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.410> character

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
each other and the way the character

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.930 
each other and the way the character
progressed<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.640> such<00:00:42.230> um<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:44.219> wasn't<00:00:44.820> feeling

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
progressed and such um I wasn't feeling

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.720 
progressed and such um I wasn't feeling
it<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:46.230> didn't<00:00:46.920> find<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> totally<00:00:47.280> believable

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it I I didn't find it totally believable

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
it I I didn't find it totally believable
and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.250> pendulum

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and I think it kind of the pendulum

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.389 
and I think it kind of the pendulum
swung<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.180> forth<00:00:51.600> too<00:00:51.840> much<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:56.129> being

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
swung back and forth too much that being

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.279 
swung back and forth too much that being

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
which is believable and character but

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.070 
which is believable and character but
then<00:04:48.919> there's<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.310> one<00:04:49.610> scene<00:04:49.970> as<00:04:50.270> we<00:04:50.960> go

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
then there's this one scene as we go

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.629 
then there's this one scene as we go
into<00:04:51.229> act<00:04:51.440> 3<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:53.949> think<00:04:54.949> breaks<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.400> story

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
into act 3 that I think breaks the story

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.510 
into act 3 that I think breaks the story
and<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:58.040> my<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:59.750> my<00:04:59.780> humility<00:05:00.229> I<00:05:00.590> didn't<00:05:01.340> pick

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
and to my to my humility I didn't pick

off her trees and her Brooke dries up
and<00:05:23.889> you<00:05:24.889> know<00:05:25.010> it's<00:05:26.979> when<00:05:27.979> viewed<00:05:28.340> as<00:05:28.610> part<00:05:28.940> of

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
and you know it's when viewed as part of

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.070 
and you know it's when viewed as part of
the<00:05:29.240> parody<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.740> works<00:05:31.270> but<00:05:32.270> in<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:32.599> context

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
the parody it works but in the context

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.520 
the parody it works but in the context
of<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.200> story<00:05:33.410> it<00:05:33.710> kind<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:34.039> breaks<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.639> story

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
of the story it kind of breaks the story

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.230 
of the story it kind of breaks the story
because<00:05:37.479> it<00:05:38.479> feels<00:05:38.840> like<00:05:39.050> years<00:05:39.349> have<00:05:39.650> passed

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
because it feels like years have passed

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.080 
because it feels like years have passed
like<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:42.740> feel<00:05:42.979> like<00:05:43.010> fluttershy<00:05:43.430> hasn't

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
like you feel like fluttershy hasn't

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.060 
like you feel like fluttershy hasn't
spoken<00:05:44.479> to<00:05:44.630> her<00:05:44.810> friends<00:05:45.260> and<00:05:45.380> years<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:45.950> has

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
spoken to her friends and years and has

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.089 
spoken to her friends and years and has
become<00:05:46.310> a<00:05:46.370> shut-in<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:47.500> that's<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.680> little<00:05:48.830> bit

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
become a shut-in and that's a little bit

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.140 
become a shut-in and that's a little bit
too<00:05:49.250> dark<00:05:49.580> for<00:05:51.220> maybe<00:05:52.220> not<00:05:52.400> for<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.580> show<00:05:52.789> but

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
too dark for maybe not for the show but

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.719 
too dark for maybe not for the show but
for<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.419> seem<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:54.800> takes<00:05:55.039> it<00:05:55.190> in<00:05:55.310> kind<00:05:55.490> of

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
for that seem it takes it in kind of

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.800 
for that seem it takes it in kind of
wrong<00:05:56.539> direction<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:58.300> then<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.419> know<00:05:59.539> pink

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810
