00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.810
 and we were watching 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.580
 for everyone and here that portrayed all the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.760
 controversy yesterday especially in 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.390
 this male competition 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.520
 I want to tell all the people that 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.930
 you are made to understand more 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.870
 clear you and also our 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.610
 audience 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.680
 if there is something 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.690
 that we do not favor us or them 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.460
 it hurts as production is who wins 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.279
 the season 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.750
 so I want to verify from now on 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.489
 the production does something to favor or 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.250
 harm someone to us that does not 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.470
 he goes or comes to us manage to worry that his 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.510
 role as tvm officials as 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.840
 competitors and everyone runs for their 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.980
 profession 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 second he made the video exhaustively 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 forget 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 and I would like to say then maybe it has 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.620
 indication comes next after 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 please perform then so that to me 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 side 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 because we were reviewing the video 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 production team there is something to say 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.250
 something important to say that is I am 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.259
 free we thoroughly review all the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.240
 cameras that we have here the conference 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.390
 one and a thousand times with the entire team 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.950
 7th street that makes this program and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.700
 there was clearly an error yesterday in the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.710
 end men 's competition where 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.409
 saw Mr. ter living and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 We gave by winners and we hit this error 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.039
 we are going to rectify it in this minute 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.800
 giving as winner of the competition to 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.600
 Mr. Txarli dic 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.990
 who goes to the experience of the day 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.990
 I lie 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.360
 perfect thank you very much the bone is 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.990
 very clear 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.090
 It is important to mention also 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.890
 and as you can see here there is no 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.939
 machine that has a guy installed 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.659
 to be seeing that what happened to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.780
 centimeters centimeters 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.030
 the referees make mistakes all 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.189
 we make mistakes the posts too 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.469
 they make mistakes there was the possibility 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.210
 rectify it thank you very much and I want to 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.100

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.429
 Thank you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.050
 something else and in this I want to be super 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.940
 emphatic 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.260
 yesterday you said all the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.840
 competitors took out the mask we 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.800
 we take the crest for the triumph 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.990
 I want to tell you that they are not only 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.730
 you who take the crest here 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.040
 there is a team behind that camera 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.820
 is on the crest as you say 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.820
 so you can do well 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.650
 so that you can do well and be 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.990
 more and more famous do well 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.200
 weekends the events 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.500
 botox 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.239
 the game team that is composed 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.590
 by marcelo dinner for text by harry 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.330
 by pancho for the magnificent ones 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.640
 pedrito by all 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.140
 they do take out the one because 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.730
 are hammering is up to now for 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.850
 create all kinds of competition this 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.160
 lesson of the rule and all that 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.800
 If they make a mistake we apologize 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.990
 but there is no intention of 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.180
 favor or harm someone 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.590
 the other and this I say on a personal basis 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.810
 he does not even ask the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.540
 production 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.489
 I as an animator of the program, I'm not going to 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.020
 accept that you disrespect the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.050
 work team I will not accept 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.640
 because because I said it until the 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.470
 tiredness and this is a family and when 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.840
 I say it's a family 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.460
 it's not a literary figure, this is not 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.830
 a real family and when you 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.340
 disrespected at home dad you 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.690
 a king arrives 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.670
 and a strong challenge 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.880
 for the same thing effectively like this 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.330
 sir costs charlin and is the legitimate 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.510
 winner from by themes 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.569
 but nevertheless 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.680
 yesterday not only I listen as the Lord 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.760
 txarli disco has been respect 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.459
 seriously to one of the posts 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.590
 and that independent of the fever of the 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.980
 moment to what is happening with the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.379
 competition we will not tolerate 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.030
 we review the images of the error of the 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.330
 judges as well as we review the 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.620
 images of charly mica error and here 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.840
 we pay righteous for sinners 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.319
 Mr. Charlie Beck, you are aware 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.840
 of this review in the absence of 5 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.599
 here 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.489
 charly yesterday did not want to go to define 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.260
 much beyond but he lacked respect 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.510
 seriously one of the judges when 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.579
 I was in the heat of competition 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.680
 when I say badly it is badly 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.320
 I will not go where else 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.330
 I want to say that there was also the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.759
 possibility that charly saw that i am 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.020
 judge will talk and as a good family 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.460
 have tried to solve all that type 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.289
 of problems and I hope it reaches a 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.960
 fourth on the part of both the drawings 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.660
 however there is a clear sanction 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.390
 in the face of this type of eventualities 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.950
 charly saw that effectively winner that 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.780
 it is indisputable he already said it if the judge 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.360
 However, there was a sanction for 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
 you for the fact seriously missed the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.780
 respect to one of our judges and about 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.370
 everything beyond our posts as 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.040
 fellow work that was ultimately 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.689
 a teammate a penalty that 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.849
 you will be notified a punishment happened 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.679
 for now we leave it like this the production 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.499
 will be responsible for saying the sanction and that 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:11.610
 punishment charly you are the winner but 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:15.529
 I think he is aware that he 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.529
 they saw punishment for that lack of respect 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.400
 and I think this is a very good 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.020
 opportunity to apologize to the 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.720
 people 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.020
 that I made feel uncomfortable that I made feel 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.910
 bad yesterday the only thing I can say that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.250
 Yesterday 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.460
 I knew that I was the winner I knew 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.760
 at all times and when they said 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.620
 that I was not the winner I put myself 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.300
 desperate I think I was 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.250
 desperate ebro 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.250
 because I thought that the crest 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.889
 and I deserved the victory and I'm not 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.199
 justifying my bad actions are already 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:03.110
 but I want to ask that apology to the 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.110
 people and those people know who they are 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.190
 and nothing more 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.930
 I want to hang up the word of charly and 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.060
 bir take advantage of apology to all 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.220
 street 7 fans for the mistake that 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.890
 we committed this program leads 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.270
 more than 900 chapters over 3 years and I 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.700
 it seems a little unfair I want to say what 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.620
 that there are still people who think that 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.000
 this is fixed or if it were 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.560
 arranged this program says lasted with 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.690
 lucky six months I say it from now like 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.400
 has happened with another program this is not 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.070
 arranged there is a clear intention of 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.020
 help the guys in this competition 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.490
 and if there is something that we are going to 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.320
 fix and we are going to put black hand to 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.610
 work is to help all 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.110
 guys fulfill their dreams because we see 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.940
 how they fight garlic every day for 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.380
 get your goals in that way poke 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.800
 black hand and let's fix whatever 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:55.680
 in the competition they go precisely 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.680
 to that we go with vision or federico co
