by the way is what you need is that for
the<00:01:58.890> key<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> key<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.420> side<00:02:00.630> but

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the key if the key is on this side but

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
the key if the key is on this side but
that's<00:02:01.079> something<00:02:01.170> else<00:02:01.409> anyway<00:02:01.740> I'll<00:02:02.340> go

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that's something else anyway I'll go

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.330 
that's something else anyway I'll go
back<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> our<00:02:03.210> person<00:02:04.130> we're<00:02:05.130> by<00:02:05.310> ourselves

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
back to our person we're by ourselves

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580

and<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and it's going to be right here this is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.279 
and it's going to be right here this is
where<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.069> motor<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> slime<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.599> not
