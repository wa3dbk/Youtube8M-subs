00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:51.600 

that<00:01:39.790> looks<00:01:40.090> very<00:01:40.390> promising

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.460 

I<00:01:54.510> guess<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:56.370> had<00:01:57.370> some<00:01:57.990> concerns<00:01:58.990> with

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
I guess the I had some concerns with

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.070 
I guess the I had some concerns with
their<00:01:59.590> 906<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.610> think<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:00.910> was<00:02:01.030> for<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.360> 4.3

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
their 906 I think it was for the 4.3

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.700 
their 906 I think it was for the 4.3
bootloader<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.610> downloaded<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.710> 905

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
bootloader so I just downloaded the 905

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.870 
bootloader so I just downloaded the 905

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
version KitKat bootloader and ran the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.050 
version KitKat bootloader and ran the
autoroute<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.510> it's<00:02:11.110> booting<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.060> wait

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
