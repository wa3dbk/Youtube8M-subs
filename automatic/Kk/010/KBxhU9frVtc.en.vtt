back today with sniper immortal items
caught<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:12.380> what<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.769> moonkin<00:00:14.730> gun<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.929> it

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
caught the what the moonkin gun so it

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.840 
caught the what the moonkin gun so it
looks<00:00:16.379> really<00:00:16.619> badass<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> grenade

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
looks really badass like a grenade

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.990 
looks really badass like a grenade
launcher<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> shotgun<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.279> stuff<00:00:20.580> but

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
launcher like a shotgun and stuff but

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.259 
launcher like a shotgun and stuff but
it's<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:21.779> too<00:00:22.320> big<00:00:22.680> for<00:00:22.980> snipe<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.490> think<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
it's really too big for snipe I think so

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.210 
it's really too big for snipe I think so
as<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> first<00:00:25.050> q<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.740> either<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.609> is

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
as for the first q you can either it is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.510 
as for the first q you can either it is
the<00:00:29.220> skew<00:00:30.230> how<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> say<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.070> skew

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the skew how do you say this the skew

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.430 
the skew how do you say this the skew
animation<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.210> different<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> 01<00:00:34.730> and

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
animation is different from the 01 and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
animation is different from the 01 and
custom<00:00:37.440> skill<00:00:38.010> skin<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> also<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.780> can

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
custom skill skin is also there we can

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.580 
custom skill skin is also there we can
see<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> q<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.530> no<00:00:40.649> longer<00:00:41.420> next<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.540> be

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
see the q is no longer next would be

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.869 
see the q is no longer next would be
next<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> ultimate<00:00:44.250> there's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
next to be the ultimate there's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
next to be the ultimate there's
assassinate<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.960> different<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.820> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
assassinate that is different for the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.529 
assassinate that is different for the
skew<00:00:48.090> also<00:00:48.450> time<00:00:49.320> instead<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.760> email<00:00:51.390> on

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
skew also time instead of the email on

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.860 
skew also time instead of the email on
top<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.379> change<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> big<00:00:53.489> big<00:00:54.239> scope<00:00:54.600> over
