00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.869
 good 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.679
 hello everyone my name is khan and we're 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.890
 in the whole naruto shippuden chapter 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:30.489
 ultimate ninja storm generations and this 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.779
 week we have gara with who has 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.670
 asked in my good friend course the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.890
 centaur 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.170
 by the way I want to show you this information 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.059
 which is very curious if we select this 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.579
 corner and then we select what 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.769
 it's mari's team and this kangaroo 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.600
 we can see that we created the group of almost 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.960
 change but on the other hand if 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.440
 we select this other is who we see 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.149
 selecting the same characters 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.399
 that we're going to the sand brothers 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.229
 but I think that for the reason of this 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.719
 video we are going to do is select what 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.350
 which is the first skin and create the power 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.059
 almost that so let's go to it 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.580
 and now in this example, let's go there 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.460
 against the great team of akatsuki e 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.900
 we started with very powerful hitachi by 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.470
 true 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.570
 ciao Let's see why I knew going 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.970
 to give a beating coming later but 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.100
 look let's control a little bit because 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.370
 this one goes up and then then and use 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.660
 a little special power let's not go 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.620
 let's use the calculation so that what 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.050
 distract 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.600
 has distracted a lot here is in these and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.000
 caixa 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.020
 if their little bodies always spaced 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.020
 use to escape 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 he feels the power of gar and now he can 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.250
 special is the time is the time 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.659
 it's time to play 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:56.299
 and it's escaping 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.630
 but we're going to give you land we have these 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.630
 countries 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.390
 as you can see it has many attacks 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.220
 efficient sand and launch it to fly 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.110
 but the bad thing is that if they go very fast 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 to the energy so we are very 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.350
 important I think I have the team 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.180
 always prepared for with we want 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.680
 recharge it this energy 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.780
 so let's see if we can now 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.780
 give him the powerful attack kit 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.870
 perfect we have it in our hands and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.689
 feel what crushing is I think 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.010
 that that is the sand tomb so what 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.269
 we have done very well and we are going to put a 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.250
 trapdoor here so that it is not us 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.349
 easily and we can attack him with the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.930
 sand that is a special face attack 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.930
 to that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.810
 control here this helps while 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.320
 meanwhile or not do not get mad do not you 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.340
 angry because if you also go to work and 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.990
 you make me these low do not go and give 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.660
 dale dale dale that are the many hits 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.070
 and we're almost going to put in we 're going to beat no 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.230
 that we do not lose anything because it is very 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.800
 important to arrive almost intact in the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.800
 last fight 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.060
 please please die now 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.070
 good guys 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.960
 I'm sweating like being line but 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.810
 well let's talk a little bit about the 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.240
 desert comes from the hidden area of 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.490
 sand and when I was little in the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.480
 your mom's belly your dad what you wanted 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.400
 be a lethal and perfect weapon, not like that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.770
 that what he did was introduce the beast 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.340
 of a tail in the body to deny this 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.319
 beast we already know it is sugar 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.599
 unfortunately for this all life 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.060
 I was very scared so what 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.140
 mistreated and did no less already know 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.209
 as always all the villages 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.670
 unfortunate of these of naruto always 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.489
 they treat the poor characters badly and 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.220
 It will obviously give what happened to him 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.860
 that he began to hate all these people like that 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.830
 who does not want to be left other than to return 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.060
 be bad we can put that so this 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.769
 The character is also very curious because 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.840
 is a one of the favorites in the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.269
 creators of the series since it makes a 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.569
 small contrast with naruto like all 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.169
 we know this the two have been rejected 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.519
 technically for the same reason so 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.610
 is a very important character for the 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.430
 series since these as we know right now 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.560
 in the series right now he's the commander of the 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.820
 army being skillful and pósito 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.220
 I recommend but right now what is the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.960
 anime or I guess the manga but 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.220
 honestly I do not see the manga so 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.500
 I recommend them in the snow because 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.389
 The only one you saw was recommended to you 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.800
 to see what the series avoids when it was 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.960
 girl 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.750
 let's go into angry mode and 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 let's give it with all our power 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.000
 because we need to win this gameplay 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.360
 taking 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.010
 energy and let's give it and we 're going to 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.800
 give him truce we all know that if you 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.230
 we give truce over come and they lament you 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.240
 on the whole face 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.240
 so feel the power of the sand of 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.480
 gala 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.700
 and let's get closer 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.740
 as you can see it is really powerful 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.250
 but unfortunately, in my opinion, it is 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.540
 well as wound about him dale 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.390
 with the sand because we need to win 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.310
 this gameplay ok we have gone the power 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.950
 special so we still have 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.960
 hope that I can do what it is 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.480
 the victory of this game is very 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.780
 necessary because seriously guys 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.820
 I need to win 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.860
 I need to deconcentrate and be 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.990
 perfect perfect guys I'm very happy 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.150
 because it was really costing me 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.440
 much as I said or gara is a 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.970
 little complicated to use since it is a 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.470
 Very slow character 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.930
 but I think that if you learn to do the 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.690
 combos at the right time it knows 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.510
 very well honestly it goes very well 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.389
 than from practicing a little before 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.340
 use it and afterwards you can a little 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.380
 fail with him really is a character 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.270
 very funny like me to me in what 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.760
 personal I love face is a character 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.320
 very well designed and in the history then 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.880
 yes the truth is that it is a great role 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.310
 so well I hope you have them 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.050
 liked and that they continue seeing what 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.160
 it's two chapters in the challenge 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.580
 remember to keep losing your 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.380
 characters and here I am and well then that 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.100
 been thank you very much and see you next time 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.100
