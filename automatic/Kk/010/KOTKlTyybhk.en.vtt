nicely but if you turn all the way put
it<00:03:12.170> all<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.350> way<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> lock<00:03:12.829> you'll<00:03:13.370> bleed

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
it all the way to the lock you'll bleed

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.009 
it all the way to the lock you'll bleed
off<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:13.940> much<00:03:14.060> speed<00:03:14.359> that<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.630> stern<00:03:14.840> wants

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
off so much speed that the stern wants

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.270 
off so much speed that the stern wants
to<00:03:15.170> kind<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.380> pitch<00:03:15.560> around<00:03:15.709> but<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.100> never

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
to kind of pitch around but it never

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.910 
to kind of pitch around but it never
quite<00:03:16.489> gets<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.030> point<00:03:17.829> when<00:03:18.829> you're

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
quite gets to that point when you're

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.319 
quite gets to that point when you're
accelerating<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.609> bow<00:03:19.730> will<00:03:19.910> come<00:03:20.030> up<00:03:20.120> about

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
accelerating the bow will come up about

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.090 
accelerating the bow will come up about
five<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.750> seven<00:03:20.900> degrees<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.650> did<00:03:21.829> not<00:03:21.950> lose

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
five to seven degrees and I did not lose

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.440 
five to seven degrees and I did not lose
sight<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.549> horizon<00:03:22.670> at<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.180> throughout

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
sight of the horizon at all throughout

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.170 
sight of the horizon at all throughout
the<00:03:23.600> entire<00:03:23.870> acceleration<00:03:24.850> when<00:03:25.850> I'm<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the entire acceleration when I'm in the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.759 
the entire acceleration when I'm in the
seated<00:03:26.480> position<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.989> think<00:03:27.049> that<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.410> engine

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
seated position I think that you engine

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.199 
seated position I think that you engine
control<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> little<00:03:28.250> bit<00:03:28.579> high<00:03:28.819> but<00:03:29.060> if

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
control is a little bit high but if

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.059 
control is a little bit high but if
you're<00:03:29.359> up<00:03:29.540> on<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> bolster<00:03:30.109> now<00:03:30.709> it's<00:03:30.889> much

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
you're up on the bolster now it's much

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.400 
you're up on the bolster now it's much
more<00:03:31.280> comfortable<00:03:31.519> there's<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.630> nice<00:03:32.810> arm<00:03:33.139> rest

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
more comfortable there's a nice arm rest

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.410 
more comfortable there's a nice arm rest
so<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.769> rest<00:03:34.100> your<00:03:34.280> arm<00:03:34.489> while<00:03:35.180> you're

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
so you can rest your arm while you're

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.270 
so you can rest your arm while you're
using<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.019> controls<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.620> make<00:03:37.069> nice

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
using the controls and make nice

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.500 
using the controls and make nice
incremental<00:03:37.940> changes<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.480> like<00:03:38.630> that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
incremental changes I like that

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.089 
incremental changes I like that
well<00:03:41.080> that's<00:03:41.230> our<00:03:41.379> full<00:03:41.620> test<00:03:41.920> and

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
well that's our full test and

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.550 
well that's our full test and
