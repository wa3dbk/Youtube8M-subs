trying a tattooist lipo pack just for
giggles<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.360> did<00:00:36.360> burn<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.110> stock<00:00:37.440> motor

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
giggles I did burn out the stock motor

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340 
giggles I did burn out the stock motor
last<00:00:38.040> time<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> ran<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> lipo<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
last time I ran a lipo in this if you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
last time I ran a lipo in this if you
burn<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> again<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.160> not<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.610> fast<00:00:41.940> I've

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
burn that again I'm not really fast I've

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
burn that again I'm not really fast I've
already<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> brushless<00:00:43.350> system<00:00:43.829> line<00:00:44.010> up

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
already got a brushless system line up

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
already got a brushless system line up
to<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:46.200> want<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.680> what

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to go in here so I just want to see what

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
to go in here so I just want to see what
the<00:00:46.950> lipo<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.640> does<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.120> far<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.450> speed

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the lipo actually does as far as speed

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
the lipo actually does as far as speed
wise<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.289> yeah<00:00:49.829> let's<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> look<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.640> what

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
wise so yeah let's have a look see what

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.470 
wise so yeah let's have a look see what
this<00:00:50.850> guy's<00:00:51.059> got

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
this guy's got

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
this guy's got
all<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.800> well<00:00:53.520> tracks<00:00:53.850> teaching<00:00:55.489> I'm<00:00:56.489> not

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
all right well tracks teaching I'm not

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.830 
all right well tracks teaching I'm not
quite<00:00:56.879> sure<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.449> ticking

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
quite sure what that little ticking

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
quite sure what that little ticking
noise<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:59.719> anyways<00:01:01.190> let's<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.460> we

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
noise is but anyways let's see what we

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.859 
noise is but anyways let's see what we
get

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.770 

you<00:01:08.869> got<00:01:09.020> 40<00:01:10.210> that's<00:01:11.830> not<00:01:12.830> too<00:01:13.040> bad<00:01:13.540> let's<00:01:14.540> go

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
you got 40 that's not too bad let's go

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.060 
you got 40 that's not too bad let's go
again<00:01:15.400> that<00:01:16.400> eats<00:01:16.670> kilometres<00:01:17.150> an<00:01:17.420> hour<00:01:17.509> all

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
again that eats kilometres an hour all

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.649 
again that eats kilometres an hour all
the<00:01:19.070> steering<00:01:19.549> is<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> little<00:01:20.090> lazy

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
the steering is a little lazy

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.999 
the steering is a little lazy
I<00:01:20.690> find<00:01:21.259> myself<00:01:22.570> correcting<00:01:23.619> or<00:01:24.619> over

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
I find myself correcting or over

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.770 
I find myself correcting or over
correcting<00:01:25.430> because<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.970> servo<00:01:26.420> just<00:01:26.630> takes

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
correcting because the servo just takes

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.950 
correcting because the servo just takes
forever<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.080> get<00:01:27.259> back<00:01:27.440> into<00:01:27.619> Center<00:01:34.509> 39<00:01:35.509> all

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
forever to get back into Center 39 all

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.810 
forever to get back into Center 39 all
right<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:39.160> probably<00:01:40.160> where<00:01:40.399> it's<00:01:40.580> going

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
right that is probably where it's going

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.719 
right that is probably where it's going
to<00:01:40.910> be<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.619> don't<00:01:42.619> think<00:01:42.950> it's<00:01:43.250> going<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.490> be<00:01:43.580> any

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
to be I don't think it's going to be any

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.940 
to be I don't think it's going to be any
faster<00:01:44.179> than<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.450> let's<00:01:44.720> try<00:01:44.869> one<00:01:45.080> more<00:01:45.110> time

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.349 

forty-five

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
forty-five

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.310 
forty-five
it's<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.899> bit<00:01:54.109> of<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.289> jump

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.200 

I'll<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.220> more<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.030> might<00:02:00.180> be

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I'll do one more I think that might be

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.710 
I'll do one more I think that might be
an<00:02:00.390> odd<00:02:00.510> one<00:02:00.660> out<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.080> let's<00:02:01.650> try<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.980> again

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.690 

what<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.940> can't<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:12.040> he<00:02:13.040> cannot<00:02:13.460> be<00:02:15.490> now<00:02:16.490> we<00:02:16.550> have

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
what I can't be he cannot be now we have

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.880 
what I can't be he cannot be now we have
to<00:02:16.790> do<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.970> again

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.830 

forty-eight<00:02:25.890> again<00:02:26.159> well<00:02:26.370> okay<00:02:26.909> so<00:02:27.120> meet<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
forty-eight again well okay so meet the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.869 
forty-eight again well okay so meet the
high<00:02:27.989> forties<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.739> seems<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.189> first<00:02:29.370> two<00:02:29.610> runs

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
high forties it seems the first two runs

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.800 
high forties it seems the first two runs
will<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.329> warm<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:31.489> it's<00:02:32.489> kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.790> weird<00:02:33.090> got

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
will just warm up it's kind of weird got

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.899 
will just warm up it's kind of weird got
faster<00:02:34.349> real<00:02:35.159> faster

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
faster real faster

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.630 
faster real faster
I<00:02:36.379> think<00:02:37.379> not<00:02:37.500> too<00:02:37.680> bad<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.099> right<00:02:38.280> let's<00:02:38.459> put

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
I think not too bad all right let's put

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.100 
I think not too bad all right let's put
the<00:02:38.670> lipo<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.510> see<00:02:39.689> if<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.959> blow

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the lipo in there and see if we can blow

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.390 
the lipo in there and see if we can blow
that<00:02:40.200> stock<00:02:40.650> Maya<00:02:40.890> door<00:02:41.069> up

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
that stock Maya door up

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.119 
that stock Maya door up
all<00:02:42.329> right<00:02:42.540> okay<00:02:43.019> see<00:02:43.260> all<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.530> get<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:43.860> with
