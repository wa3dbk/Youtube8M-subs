00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.999
 or the youtube peÃ±a here manuel bad in 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.450
 word of the two 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:10.749
 today I present the seraphim weapon patriot 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.690
 a sniper rifle which we can 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:16.000
 buy on 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.660
 the seller of seraphim objects or 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.660
 we can stumble sela to master and the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.970
 invincible 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.070
 The truth is that this rifle 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.869
 sniper reminds me of another there 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.420
 very similar but good let's see it 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.390
 for now 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.090
 patriot vale is often name is like that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.790
 the patriot let's see 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.610
 has a good damage the truth is that yes 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.250
 very very good damage the truth the precision 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.260
 and that is missing fire rate 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.690
 very good loading speed 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.600
 good charger size 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.059
 to be of clear vlado but attention damage 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.250
 burns is not very important but if 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.510
 the probability of elementary effects 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.489
 of this weapon is very high 30% 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.920
 our voice will never be silenced has 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.680
 a good zoom and a hundred percent 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.670
 120 percent more damage per 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.800
 critical impact let's see it in action 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.200
 here in the distance it's worth 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.290
 I'm aiming a little shooting at 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.350
 little bit and you're already seeing it 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.000
 the truth is that what weapons does it look like 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.170
 more it looks a lot like the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.790
 a rifle sniper aid voucher is very 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.530
 seemed very very similar that is the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.830
 qualities that this rifle has 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.870
 sniper remember this in the df in 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.360
 Captain Scarlett, I already told you 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.030
 how to get it is in all 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.170
 elementary effects less in the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 explosive and apparently good and both with 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.229
 the sniper rifle that bought it 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 with crazy unemployment forgiveness on the way has 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.840
 the same operation has to be 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.470
 used medium to short distance because 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.310
 the long- distance truth the charger 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.530
 let's go and we're going to waste it 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.420
 but that's what I'm saying on average 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.630
 as for example active what they have seen 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.290
 before a short distance is great and 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.150
 if we look for the weak points 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.650
 very much very much better here is another 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.650
 example of shots like this 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.670
 not the truth is that it does not work well 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.100
 well it does not work in case we are 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.230
 attacked very very close and we do not want 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.740
 or use the peephole that we could do 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.710
 We could use it as a 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.050
 normal submachine gun if it would be very good 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.340
 idea also use it as a submachine gun 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.380
 normal in case the enemies 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.120
 were very close in case of the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.420
 enemies very far as here for example 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.880
 and that this one is not moving no no 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.490
 it is advisable to use already the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.760
 I'm saying of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.260
 cut mid-distance if possible 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.150
 because as long distance 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.280
 imagine the bullets that we are going to have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.770
 to lose and see that this enemy is 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.400
 still in miren 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:19.300
 well nothing we know effects I've 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.820
 advised how to use it so that 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.970
 classes is clear preference to be a 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.830
 good sniper rifle the truth is 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.510
 which is good for all classes but 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.310
 who will benefit most who 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.900
 I will get more out of it is like 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.570
 always but with his tree full of 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.550
 sniper the others will already take them 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.050
 a little more they will get a little less 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.650
 but good 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.530
 at the time of continuing to compare what has been said 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.260
 if we look for a legendary weapon which 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.260
 have the same or almost the same qualities 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.110
 same the liquid is the same doing 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.690
 that this weapon for me to suspend in the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.060
 test you already know that seraphim weapons will 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.000
 I have compared them to legendary weapons 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.370
 in almost all videos not to say 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.130
 which is Incas not to say they continue 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.990
 all so nothing in preference between 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.050
 get a help and get this 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.739
 sniper rifle there is that is easier 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.170
 get help so nothing if you 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.110
 they are asking all the enemies 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.480
 all all are all going to fall very 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.300
 easily cope with this rifle 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.610
 sniper we are seeing it true 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.400
 if half short distance is used all 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.490
 the enemies all the bad are going to be the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.680
 enemies that move very close to 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.470
 and we move very quickly 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.510
 style to stalkers are enemies 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.310
 static or move little like 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.450
 pirates 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:51.480
 healthy toxic or here the crystals and 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:55.230
 vices these also in the name then 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.300
 Nothing is ideal and as I was saying in 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.950
 case of the enemies are very close 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.140
 it is used as a machine gun 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.160
 normal and you're here you are seeing it 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.710
 true 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.400
 what said this weapon for me deserves the 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.400
 sorry no 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.500
 go and get help is much more 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.480
 easy compared to getting to 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.450
 this is because they know that master and 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.550
 invincible is a character of much 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.220
 very careful and one of the most bosses 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.110
 difficult of this game good nothing like 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.100
 I always say thank you for having seen me and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.100
 a hug to all
