00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.380 
blowing out so that's why I like it so
much<00:02:04.229> okay<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.009> here's<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> fire<00:02:05.610> steel<00:02:05.910> this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
much okay so here's the fire steel this

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.620 
much okay so here's the fire steel this
puts<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.080> 5000<00:02:07.890> degree<00:02:08.130> flame<00:02:08.630> it

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
puts out about a 5000 degree flame it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.210 
puts out about a 5000 degree flame it
comes<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> striker<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.890> attached

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
comes with a striker that's attached

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
comes with a striker that's attached
with<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> cord<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.420> wanted<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.019> could

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
with a cord if you wanted to you could

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.070 
with a cord if you wanted to you could
cut<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:15.900> knife

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
cut this out and just use it or knife

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.070 
cut this out and just use it or knife
and<00:02:16.549> strike<00:02:17.549> strike<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.269> fire<00:02:18.480> steel<00:02:18.720> itself

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
and strike strike the fire steel itself

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.410 
and strike strike the fire steel itself
with<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.620> your<00:02:19.769> knife<00:02:19.920> blade<00:02:20.190> however<00:02:20.820> this

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
with with your knife blade however this

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.120 
with with your knife blade however this
is<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> hundred-dollar<00:02:22.049> knife<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.920> don't

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
is a hundred-dollar knife and I don't

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940 
is a hundred-dollar knife and I don't
want<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.549> do<00:02:24.060> anything<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.660> damage<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.709> i

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
want to do anything to damage it so i

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.560 
want to do anything to damage it so i
think<00:02:26.130> i'll<00:02:26.340> use<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.880> striker<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.299> comes

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
think i'll use the striker that comes

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.229 
think i'll use the striker that comes
with<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.040> two<00:02:29.280> sides<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.790> make<00:02:30.000> sure

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
with it there are two sides to make sure

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.910 
with it there are two sides to make sure
that<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.720> right<00:02:30.959> side<00:02:31.230> facing<00:02:31.470> its

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
that you have the right side facing its

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.610 
that you have the right side facing its
marked<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.299> know<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.870> let's

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
marked up so that you know and let's

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:49.200 
marked up so that you know and let's
just<00:02:34.769> see<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.070> can<00:02:35.250> get<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:36.980> flame<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.220> this

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.110 

well<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:50.480> definitely<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.990> good<00:02:51.140> spark<00:02:51.470> but

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
well it's definitely a good spark but

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.280 
well it's definitely a good spark but
not<00:02:54.700> really<00:02:55.700> easily<00:02:56.240> able<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.810> light<00:02:57.050> this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
not really easily able to light this

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:17.020 
not really easily able to light this
cotton<00:02:58.040> ball<00:03:15.250> okay<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.310> I'm<00:03:16.489> trying<00:03:16.730> both

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
cotton ball okay so I'm trying both

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.750 
cotton ball okay so I'm trying both
shorter<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.080> longer<00:03:18.320> strokes<00:03:21.220> almost

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:35.720 

starting<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.880> smolder

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.580 

well<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:37.030> could<00:03:37.600> probably<00:03:37.630> get<00:03:38.020> this<00:03:38.170> going<00:03:38.440> if

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
well I could probably get this going if

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.950 
well I could probably get this going if
I<00:03:38.740> spend<00:03:39.730> enough<00:03:39.940> time<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.210> it<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.870> be

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
I spend enough time on it but to be

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.440 
I spend enough time on it but to be
honest<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.530> I'll<00:03:42.310> take<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.580> bit<00:03:42.820> in<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
honest with you I'll take a bit in the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.870 
honest with you I'll take a bit in the
cotton<00:03:43.750> balls<00:03:43.930> first<00:03:44.680> I'm<00:03:45.220> not<00:03:45.340> giving<00:03:45.640> up<00:03:45.700> on

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
cotton balls first I'm not giving up on

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.700 
cotton balls first I'm not giving up on
this<00:03:46.030> however<00:03:46.270> I<00:03:46.630> think<00:03:46.930> what<00:03:47.260> I'll<00:03:47.320> do<00:03:47.470> is

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
this however I think what I'll do is

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.390 
this however I think what I'll do is
I'll<00:03:48.120> try<00:03:49.120> using<00:03:49.780> some<00:03:50.070> tinder<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.250> can

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
I'll try using some tinder that I can

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.430 
I'll try using some tinder that I can
find<00:03:51.640> around<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.910> forest<00:03:52.270> floor<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.780> see<00:03:53.350> if

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
find around the forest floor and see if

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.310 
find around the forest floor and see if
this<00:03:53.590> works<00:03:53.770> with<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:54.820> but<00:03:55.540> for<00:03:56.020> now<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.170> think

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
this works with that but for now I think

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.380 
this works with that but for now I think
I'll<00:03:56.590> stick<00:03:56.770> with<00:03:56.830> this<00:03:57.040> one<00:03:57.300> for<00:03:58.300> obvious

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
I'll stick with this one for obvious

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.660 
I'll stick with this one for obvious
reasons<00:03:59.020> so<00:03:59.230> we've<00:03:59.740> got<00:03:59.950> smoke<00:04:00.220> we've<00:04:00.490> got

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
reasons so we've got smoke we've got

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.450 
reasons so we've got smoke we've got
fire<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.570> think<00:04:01.720> I'll<00:04:01.930> take<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.200> fire<00:04:02.460> hope

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
fire so I think I'll take the fire hope

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.000 
fire so I think I'll take the fire hope
you<00:04:03.580> enjoyed<00:04:03.850> it
