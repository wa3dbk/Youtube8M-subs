 entering the summer even more from here 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 Little we will enter the summer then 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.869
 I know it will soon get very hot 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.060
 I decided to do this makeup then 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.890
 For you who lives in the river for you? 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 a kiss and stay with tutorial 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.390
 Good people, the first thing that I go 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.610
 to do then to start is to pass the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.250
 facial moisturizer and if I am using 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.799
 nivea software windows 7 well levinho 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.350
 to face body and hands 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.990
 So it moisturizes me so well I was in the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.549
 my face usually I think important 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.799
 we always treat the skin before 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.229
 get the makeup and how we are 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.850
 no beron mp is already a little bit of use 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.740
 It does not have to be a very moisturizing 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 Heavy so everything in that ninja's 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.479
 now I'm going to apply a base the base I 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.549
 I chose this makeup was based on 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.560
 mate da can said berenice 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.180
 already my korea 2 I think I missed it 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 A little dark for me but like me. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.250
 'm more tanned will now work out 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.920
 I had body, I think it's very ideal, you. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.560
 use a matt base now in summer because 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.780
 there is no danger of dripping or becoming 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.700
 oily in your 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 face during the day then open with this 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.400
 base all over my face I like 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.020
 stay with your hands 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.420
 Now let's go to a corrective I'm 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.180
 using this one from mac to my color that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.950
 want to know how to start 20 is I bought 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.350
 this new one is that he has the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.020
 bank different from those 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.850
 so I thought it was better and now I bought it on 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.040
 right color because I do not know if you have seen 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.989
 but I had bought it when I traveled a 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.630
 little darker then he got 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.270
 buy now and I'll apply 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.560
 it in my dark circles and 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.019
 anything else I wanted 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.269
 cover this collective he has a 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.260
 very good coverage so excellent 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.820
 spreads super easy and it lasts so much 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.160
 both collective 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.319
 now let's apply the touch is to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 standardize all this and leave the skin 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.430
 with a finish more mars I think 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.489
 for hot days what was essential 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.830
 to seal all makeup make hold 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.709
 even the creamy products to the block I 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.630
 I'll use the jasmine's and you and me. 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.720
 I will apply it with this brush that 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.120
 rode fighter now south west 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.459
 I decided to choose a darker tone more 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.470
 closed by bronze and not so rosy 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.450
 I think it gets cooler but the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.350
 west is at your discretion you use what 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.630
 you want 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.530
 Good, I'll use a bet for the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.320
 Brown 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.700
 I apply make-up blush on 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.500
 cheekbones 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.290
 a cool tip is after you get a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.290
 so fiber brush to spread 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.519
 The blush is better and it gives a finish 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.959
 Softer 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.049
 good now that our skin is already 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.060
 Let's go to the eyes and how to 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.549
 make-up for you to use in the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.489
 day by day I'm going to get this rosinha here 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.470
 which is a very light pink and I will apply 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.269
 for all my mobile work with a 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.030
 apply brush to shade well 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.600
 A little friend who makes the sound to fix it, okay? 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.640
 good 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.739
 the color is also at your discretion you 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.570
 You can choose more light colors 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.250
 so I 'm picking rosinha but if 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.500
 You do not want anything very colorful, do you? 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.630
 can pick up a light brown one color 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.140
 more cream will look beautiful too 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.640
 and then I'll get that brown here, what? 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.220
 You can see that it's what I use the most. 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.200
 of the palette it is already well spent opa esse 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.310
 here I'm going to use a vanishing brush 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.070
 brush of 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.169
 deeds fla very chubby to mark the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.540
 concave and gives a depth in the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.910
 contest for me just to have a shadow on 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.669
 eyelid and smoky on the concave already 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.020
 Makeup looks beautiful so I really like it 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.970
 to wear this makeup mainly 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.750
 When I'm without creativity then 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.470
 Rosinha with the street gets super cute 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.690
 leave in the house a little more 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.760
 implemented and I'll get a brush 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.910
 as well mosey day you point it's a 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.710
 culture of kit and I'll make a dash 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.990
 I'll get the same one I used to 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.440
 mark the concave and I will do as if 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.419
 it would be a good thing to score under the gaze 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.220
 of the children about thought it was a bit 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.870
 less incremental I think it stays 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.060
 It's beautiful this way 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.400
 now just bend your belts and apply 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.100
 pretty eyelash mask 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.310
 I am using is of falseness of lineu 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.740
 loves only that super long lashes and 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.780
 leaves a very natural effect then well 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.760
 also cool for day to day and now 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.950
 to finish the makeup we go 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.000
 I passed a lipstick and I chose to send the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.250
 Mac who is a nude medium very daring in 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.100
 truth and looks great so I'll pass on 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.590
 My mouth is very creamy and there, just to 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.300
 close the makeup is only result hope 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.720
 that you liked to see how I 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.039
 I did this makeup for hot days and 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.910
 I really hope that the strike has 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.910
