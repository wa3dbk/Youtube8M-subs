00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.240
 if reindeer provides 24 hours of a game 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.139
 transcendental for the aspirations of the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 eleven caldas as the group as Saturn 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.610
 well come quite motivated we just 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.780
 to finish the practice and to the last 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.300
 food that match and good 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.820
 finalizing details is not the idea is 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.000
 is to have a well-grouped team a 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.550
 equipment that has 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.440
 the lines well close that is important 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.080
 in handling the ball and having 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.940
 a quick exit because those are three 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.040
 fundamental aspects to the party of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960
 but tomorrow we will find that is 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.780
 find the musical of tomorrow the front 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.400
 good after seeing part after the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.739
 court in a tribune that is encouraging me 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.170
 from your team very close tomato we're going to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.030
 have to withstand the pressure of 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.379
 followers and good and in football 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.570
 showgirls is what we saw the last 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.160
 party of them is also more 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.540
 dynamic to recover the ball in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.010
 opposite field where we have to be 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.750
 smart ponders that play long 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.940
 play long when you have to go out playing 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.740
 cut we have to do it is also a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.259
 ideal scenario conducive to play good 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.520
 soccer and good we have to have a lot 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.130
 watch out for the still ball 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.070
 They are great they are good at the game 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.250
 aerial and good and we have to have a lot 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.250
 concentration 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.200
 not giving a lost ball there is where 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.000
 we have to be well concentrated that 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.710
 that is the formula no no and we do not believe 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.540
 lower not try to hurt them 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.850
 try to look 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.940
 penetrate that defense that you sometimes see 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.710
 slow to do our collective football with 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.090
 a little more elaboration of game in 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.980
 half of the court that is a task 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.410
 correct is what they are 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.290
 they are things that in tomorrow we are going to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.570
 find us in the match 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.260
 regarding the group that acted in Colombia 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.840
 variants are expected to continue the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.079
 same payroll goes the same play area 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.939
 let's say let's say the 4-4-1-1 that 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.090
 is being established for tomorrow not 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.329
 has signs but if not a change 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 enters josé luís moreno from central was going to 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.280
 play jonathan lopera of flyers for 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.230
 win a little more aggressiveness in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.299
 half court so a little more game 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.760
 aerial both offensively and 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.110
 defensively because because Jose Luis 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.459
 it helps us and it helps 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.760
 take advantage of the good time you live 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.160
 jonathan in football not 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.440
 so I think the important thing 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.110
 we have to try to get the most 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.819
 profit because he knows with the ball is 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.530
 popular forward location for that 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.120
 has good air play then we win 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.890
 with josé luís and we won with jonathan 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.880
 also in the middle of the song because 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.989
 you already have international experience 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.480
 and has competed where to eradicate 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.489
 the key to get us a result 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.190
 favorable manizales all do not leave us 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.620
 intimidate him for the rival for the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.209
 pressure of the public not to have the character 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.640
 necessary to enter the field and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.069
 fight and fight it here because it's here 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.499
 where where that difference is marked 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.040
 they did not daunt and neither with the 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.040
 nervous
