00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.310 

okay<00:00:57.770> this<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:58.850> how<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.090> tank<00:00:59.390> looks<00:00:59.600> no<00:00:59.870> at

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
okay this is how the tank looks no at

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.030 
okay this is how the tank looks no at
the<00:01:00.440> moment<00:01:03.309> as<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.460> can<00:01:04.640> see<00:01:05.860> cleared<00:01:06.860> up

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
the moment as you can see cleared up

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:22.270 
the moment as you can see cleared up
nicely<00:01:13.570> just<00:01:14.570> give<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.930> bit<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.350> look<00:01:21.280> we

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
nicely just give you a bit of a look we

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.330 
nicely just give you a bit of a look we
make<00:01:22.640> her<00:01:23.800> have<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.950> air<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:26.110> two<00:01:27.110> filters<00:01:27.590> all

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
make her have the air on two filters all

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.810 
make her have the air on two filters all
I've<00:01:28.490> done<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:32.860> have<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.070> filter<00:01:34.430> set<00:01:34.700> at

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
I've done is I have the filter set at

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.530 
I've done is I have the filter set at
different<00:01:34.940> heights

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.730 

hopefully<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.690> keep<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.170> clean

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.300 

so<00:01:48.340> far<00:01:49.260> hasn't<00:01:50.260> mean<00:01:50.470> too<00:01:50.650> much<00:01:50.830> problems

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
so far hasn't mean too much problems

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.350 
so far hasn't mean too much problems
definitely<00:01:52.180> think<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.950> two<00:01:54.250> Plex<00:01:54.670> will<00:01:55.150> have

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
definitely think the two Plex will have

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.500 
definitely think the two Plex will have
to<00:01:55.540> go<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:57.100> I'm<00:01:57.340> trying<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.640> go<00:01:57.880> another<00:01:58.090> tank

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
to go so I'm trying to go another tank

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.880 
to go so I'm trying to go another tank
sorted<00:01:58.960> for<00:01:59.140> them<00:01:59.229> at<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.409> moment

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
sorted for them at the moment

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.789 
sorted for them at the moment
which<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:00.940> why<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.450> have<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.200> stuff<00:02:02.500> up<00:02:02.650> in<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
which is why I have this stuff up in the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.820 
which is why I have this stuff up in the
corner<00:02:03.220> because<00:02:03.700> they<00:02:03.970> seem<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.650> spend<00:02:05.650> most

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
corner because they seem to spend most

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.870 
corner because they seem to spend most
of<00:02:06.040> their<00:02:06.130> time<00:02:06.990> uprooting<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:11.730> suppose<00:02:12.730> you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
of their time uprooting but suppose you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.290 
of their time uprooting but suppose you
can't<00:02:13.150> blame<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.660> for<00:02:13.720> it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.710 

good<00:02:19.300> all<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.780> all<00:02:21.630> I'm<00:02:22.630> happy

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.040 

so<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.760> give<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> quick<00:02:33.120> look<00:02:33.300> let

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so just if you give you a quick look let

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:47.140 
so just if you give you a quick look let
me<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:35.040> underneath<00:02:42.260> two<00:02:43.260> filters

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.540 

that's<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.330> they're<00:02:48.510> both<00:02:48.690> doing<00:02:49.550> thousand

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
that's how they're both doing thousand

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.720 
that's how they're both doing thousand
liters<00:02:50.880> per<00:02:51.090> hour<00:02:51.410> or<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:52.770> say<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:55.410> one

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
liters per hour or so they say this one

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.610 
liters per hour or so they say this one
is<00:02:58.100> mainly<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.690> filter<00:03:00.690> pads<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.440> one

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
is mainly just filter pads and this one

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.310 
is mainly just filter pads and this one
is<00:03:05.870> bio<00:03:06.870> bonds<00:03:07.730> ceramics<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.080> haven't<00:03:10.080> put<00:03:10.200> any

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
is bio bonds ceramics I haven't put any

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.830 
is bio bonds ceramics I haven't put any
carbon<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:13.670> seems<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.820> lot<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.090> what<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.510> read

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
carbon in seems a lot of what I read

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020 
carbon in seems a lot of what I read
says<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.440> maybe<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.950> planted<00:03:17.340> tanks<00:03:17.640> carbon

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
says that maybe for planted tanks carbon

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.100 
says that maybe for planted tanks carbon
isn't<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.420> good<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.110> left<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
isn't so good so I left that out and I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.770 
isn't so good so I left that out and I
have<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:22.860> lading<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.370> timers

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.690 

I<00:03:34.340> got<00:03:35.340> some<00:03:35.580> pure<00:03:35.940> region<00:03:36.330> where<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> didn't

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
I got some pure region where I didn't

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.210 
I got some pure region where I didn't
battalion<00:03:38.700> aidar<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:40.410> can<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.830> give<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
battalion aidar you can just give it a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.130 
battalion aidar you can just give it a
few<00:03:41.430> weeks<00:03:41.750> see<00:03:42.750> how<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> tank<00:03:43.230> cold<00:03:44.240> so<00:03:45.240> all

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
few weeks see how the tank cold so all

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.160 
few weeks see how the tank cold so all
in<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:48.440> think<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.709> looks<00:03:49.890> pretty<00:03:50.100> okay<00:03:51.170> for

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
in all I think it looks pretty okay for

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.240 
in all I think it looks pretty okay for
a<00:03:52.200> first<00:03:52.500> attempt<00:03:54.709> taking<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.770> change<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
a first attempt taking a change in the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:06.440 
a first attempt taking a change in the
lights<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:58.620> LEDs

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:17.740 

all<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.319> fish<00:04:07.500> seem<00:04:07.800> quite<00:04:08.459> happy<00:04:09.349> relaxed

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:30.290 

so

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.000 

there<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.199> go<00:04:34.460> see<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.490> again<00:04:35.789> soon
