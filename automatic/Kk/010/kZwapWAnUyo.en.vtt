00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.279
 if you lead the words google Duster 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.620
 translate then he will translate it as 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.750
 duster of this different salik about approach 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 of our today's car namely 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.480
 Renault Duster or how on the road to him still 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 they say 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.780
 duster this car is not popular 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 only in cis countries 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.699
 but in Europe and we are interested in what 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.699
 is popular and justified ago 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.770
 include clothes for this with Renault Duster 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.690
 everything is fine 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.030
 Of course not written by a handsome man 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.460
 would you call his appearance anyway 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.900
 harmonious does not repel and most often 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.300
 budget for cars is 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.170
 something awkward indistinct made of 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.520
 of what was 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.740
 and the duster design is actually 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.869
 was designed from scratch it was originally 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.880
 conceived so as it turned out well you and 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.740
 Orcs give the car brutality and 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.690
 muscularity thanks to them getting 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.060
 looks more than it actually is 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.310
 picture complement roof bars and 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.170
 off-road high ground clearance open 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.200
 trunk don't get your hands pretty 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.600
 difficult but it is spacious and makes 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.520
 almost 500 leaders and if you fold the rear 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.270
 the seats then it will increase by more than three 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 times in this niche is located the jack a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.390
 if you raise the floor we see the full 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 spare wheel 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.570
 getting inside 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.550
 start to understand let's start with save 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.050
 manufacturers 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.150
 Salon almost poses and pumped their 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.560
 previous generation slogan from 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.870
 electronics providing comfort 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.800
 only this cassette supporting 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.440
 everywhere flash drives 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.300
 Well, air conditioning climate control from about 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.300
 such is not in any of the complete sets 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.350
 If you take the most budget version here 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.450
 such a pillow will be glad to see you 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.880
 safety and cigarette lighter exactly 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.410
 such machines interests many people as 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.240
 claim automaker such 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.700
 cars just a couple percent of 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.320
 total mass produced by duster and people 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 you have to choose the richer version 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.180
 for example, we should probably 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.750
 mention that hard everywhere 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.570
 plastic 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.280
 interior design qualys he ergonomics 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.620
 some control units causes 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.110
 bewilderment for example beep to in gazelles 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.730
 is on the lever under the steering wheel 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.650
 adjustable mirrors under the handbrake and buttons 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.110
 power windows on the center console 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.880
 but on the other hand a budget crossover 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.830
 and below on to see the abundance of skin and 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.440
 chrome here everything is done to please 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.510
 practicality let the plastic hard but not 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.090
 squeaks and nice-looking cal on 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.280
 resistant seats wiping cancer 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.200
 gnomes quickly get used punished 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.150
 Logan owners moved to 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.550
 back sofa we see that there is nobody on it 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.500
 relief but there are three head restraints so 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.690
 that 3 adults a place here with 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.790
 Convenience and enough space left 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.890
 head but the tunnel on the floor is not at all 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.930
 high if the basic version looks 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.730
 up older causes censures in more 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.040
 expensive versions painted in body color 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.459
 bumpers alloy wheels and rails on 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.630
 the roof 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.630
 we have no questions like sailors 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.260
 when buying anther you can choose 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.620
 several engine options and can 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.890
 be petrol 16 or 2 liters capacity 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.780
 102 or 135 horsepower either diesel 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.510
 unit with a small herd under the hood 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.910
 90 horses just so worth us that 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.870
 country machine is put only on version 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.180
 front wheel drive 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.380
 if you want a car with a plug 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.950
 rear wheel drive then you will have 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.800
 constantly my become a pen 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.580
 why there is no version 4 on 4 and with a gun 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.580
 unknown 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.540
 we have a four-wheel drive car and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.810
 respectively with manual gearbox 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.000
 ik-6 but transmissions 1 through 4 are made in 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.040
 very short when driving in the city of flowers 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.200
 lesson traffic light is not very convenient but on 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.090
 the track quickly reaches 5 6 already on 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.780
 speeds of 70 kilometers an hour but further and 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.780
 Deshte calmly 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.860
 speaking of gearboxes and me 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.510
 I mean color short 1 transfer 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.280
 off-road replaces lowered and 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.910
 allows you to speed up to six 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.910
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.349
 full drive here is plug 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.909
 migrated here from nissan qashqai 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.860
 the rear wheels will help you up 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.840
 speeds of 60 kilometers an hour and then 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.669
 just disconnect but it is completely necessary 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.900
 enough to drive confidently on primers 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.900
 well, or snow porridge 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.410
 naturally need to adequately evaluate 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.050
 it is not jit with a capital letter and 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.970
 crossover for modest money therefore in 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.889
 swamp or I could drive and should 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.020
 After all, the load can overheat 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.350
 and turn off the rear wheels insist without 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.350
 help 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.509
 it is noticeable that the car was made for 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.430
 measured driving around the city or trips 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.880
 to the country with the whole family any 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.250
 traverse combo and not satisfy 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.050
 pressing the gas pedal you hear how 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.460
 measure or addressing you may still 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.460
 little woman is not behind this truck 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.110
 but all this saves fuel 

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.360
 claimed consumption is without 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.399
 half liters funny on mode on 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.490
 practice turned out to be much more but all 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.680
 equal excellent result 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.479
 so that grief well yes it becomes a car 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.400
 the interest of designs and the original jet 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.289
 the cabin is as simple as the door and therefore 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.090
 must be reliable very wall concept 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.099
 2 yourself absolutely heads minimal 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.630
 configuration only you decide what you need 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.280
 in the car and what not but 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.020
 look don't overdo it 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.479
 We're getting lost but most importantly 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.510
 how gleb advantage in cars it 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.730
 price 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.340
 with you was only looks of and among hares 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.340
 on the site will take into account while
