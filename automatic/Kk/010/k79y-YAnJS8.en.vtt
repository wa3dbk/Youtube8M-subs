these<00:00:57.030> nice<00:00:57.210> oval<00:00:57.570> labels<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.949> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
these nice oval labels also because this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
these nice oval labels also because this
aluminum<00:00:59.550> box<00:00:59.699> comes<00:01:00.210> uncoated<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.989> took<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
aluminum box comes uncoated I took it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
downstairs to the basement and sprayed

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560 
downstairs to the basement and sprayed
it<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.019> nice<00:01:04.260> coat<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.920> krylon<00:01:05.570> spray

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780

paint<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.260> grey<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.159> matched<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
paint in a grey that kind of matched the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
paint in a grey that kind of matched the
aluminum<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.630> wouldn't<00:01:09.869> look<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.380> very

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
aluminum so it wouldn't look a very

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.520 
aluminum so it wouldn't look a very
different<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.360> certainly<00:01:12.659> could<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
different but it certainly could go in a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.679 
different but it certainly could go in a
color<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.520> would<00:01:14.670> look<00:01:14.729> great<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.119> red<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
color it would look great in red it

when you just want everything out at
once<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.440> use<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> nice<00:02:48.250> teaspoon<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.180> fill<00:02:49.710> to

once I use a nice teaspoon to fill to
fill<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.310> then<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.820> kind<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.120> gauge

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
fill it and then you can kind of gauge

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.900 
fill it and then you can kind of gauge
you<00:02:52.870> don't<00:02:52.990> want<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.170> get<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.380> too<00:02:53.620> full<00:02:53.980> camp

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
you don't want to get it too full camp

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.390 
you don't want to get it too full camp
it<00:02:55.090> down<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:56.260> gives<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> nice<00:02:56.980> amount

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
it down and it gives you a nice amount

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.080 
it down and it gives you a nice amount
there<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.090> then<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.740> lid<00:02:59.980> goes<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.490> on<00:03:00.730> it

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
there and then the lid goes right on it

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.810 
there and then the lid goes right on it
now<00:03:01.240> these<00:03:01.420> lids<00:03:01.720> don't<00:03:02.110> fasten<00:03:02.650> down<00:03:03.160> very

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
now these lids don't fasten down very

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.120 
now these lids don't fasten down very
hard<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.590> careful<00:03:05.950> not<00:03:06.070> to

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
hard so you have to be careful not to

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190 
hard so you have to be careful not to
spill<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:07.120> even<00:03:07.420> if<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.660> do<00:03:07.810> you've<00:03:07.990> got<00:03:08.170> a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
spill but even if you do you've got a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.980 
spill but even if you do you've got a
nice<00:03:08.440> surface<00:03:08.830> in<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.340> box<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.970> there<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.900> is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
nice surface in this box and there it is

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.680 
nice surface in this box and there it is
the<00:03:11.260> spice<00:03:11.560> box<00:03:11.890> all<00:03:12.130> assembled<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.060> it

the spice box all assembled and it

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.960 
the spice box all assembled and it
stores<00:03:13.990> very<00:03:14.440> easily<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.760> could

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
stores very easily and you could

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.850 
stores very easily and you could
certainly<00:03:16.300> put<00:03:16.630> spices<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.500> there<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:17.830> you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
certainly put spices on there if you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.479 
certainly put spices on there if you
wanted<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.310> do<00:03:18.459> some<00:03:18.670> contrast<00:03:19.180> painting<00:03:19.780> and

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
wanted to do some contrast painting and

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.460 
wanted to do some contrast painting and
here<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.610> now<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.360> tried<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.930> get<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.110> couple

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
here it is now I tried to get a couple

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.990 
here it is now I tried to get a couple
more<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.709> these<00:03:23.860> from<00:03:24.070> Lee<00:03:24.250> Valley<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:24.820> they

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
more of these from Lee Valley but they

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.050 
more of these from Lee Valley but they
seem<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.360> have<00:03:25.720> changed<00:03:26.500> their<00:03:27.160> inventory

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
seem to have changed their inventory

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.760 
seem to have changed their inventory
just<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.360> little<00:03:28.570> bit<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.260> might<00:03:29.470> have<00:03:29.620> to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
just a little bit so you might have to

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.140 
just a little bit so you might have to
look<00:03:29.920> for<00:03:30.130> them<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.489> internet<00:03:30.970> and

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
look for them on the internet and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.810 
look for them on the internet and
meanwhile<00:03:31.840> Lee<00:03:32.020> Valley<00:03:32.260> has<00:03:32.560> one<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:33.520> is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
meanwhile Lee Valley has one that is

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.030 
meanwhile Lee Valley has one that is
about<00:03:34.060> fourteen<00:03:34.540> dollars<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.380> has<00:03:35.530> seven

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
about fourteen dollars and it has seven

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.930 
about fourteen dollars and it has seven
spice<00:03:37.320> containers<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.640> it's<00:03:39.640> stainless

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
spice containers and it's stainless

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.550 
spice containers and it's stainless
steel<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.570> wouldn't<00:03:40.930> have<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.230> paint<00:03:41.410> it

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
steel so you wouldn't have to paint it

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.110 
steel so you wouldn't have to paint it
but<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.070> course<00:03:42.130> then<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.550> wouldn't<00:03:42.820> get<00:03:42.940> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
but of course then you wouldn't get the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.030 
but of course then you wouldn't get the
variety<00:03:43.300> either<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:44.500> certainly<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.830> good

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
variety either but it's certainly a good
