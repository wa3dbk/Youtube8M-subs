the sort of stand back a little bit in
which<00:00:50.100> case<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.760> essentially<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.270> chop

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
which case you essentially just chop

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
which case you essentially just chop
four<00:00:53.100> chops<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.120> square<00:00:54.510> around<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
but what I like to do is that because

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.880 
but what I like to do is that because
sometimes<00:01:02.120> there's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.600> excess<00:01:04.320> husk

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
sometimes there's a lot of excess husk

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
sometimes there's a lot of excess husk
before<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> reach<00:01:06.030> them<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
before you reach them that so I like to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
before you reach them that so I like to
just<00:01:07.140> shave<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> off<00:01:07.680> first<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.460> what

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
just shave that off first so that's what

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
just shave that off first so that's what
I<00:01:08.640> want<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> show<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> butcher's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I want to show you take a butcher's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
I want to show you take a butcher's
knife<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> best<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
knife that's the best but you can you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
knife that's the best but you can you
can<00:01:12.330> even<00:01:12.479> use<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:13.110> any<00:01:13.200> knife<00:01:13.590> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
can even use really any knife but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820 
can even use really any knife but
easiest<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> heavy<00:01:15.600> knife<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
easiest with a heavy knife and then you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.210 
easiest with a heavy knife and then you
just<00:01:16.979> shave<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> excess<00:01:19.229> husk<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.040> this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
just shave off the excess husk and this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.609 
just shave off the excess husk and this
one<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.790> almost<00:01:20.939> none<00:01:21.409> sometimes<00:01:22.409> there's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
one it was almost none sometimes there's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.969 
one it was almost none sometimes there's
more<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:24.450> shave<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.020> until<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> reach

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
more just shave that off until you reach

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
more just shave that off until you reach
the<00:01:26.189> dinner<00:01:26.400> nut<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> hold

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the dinner nut and then I like to hold

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.260 
the dinner nut and then I like to hold
it<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.520> precise<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it because it's more precise like that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.569 
it because it's more precise like that
but<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.229> could<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> table<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
but you could put it on the table and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.890 
but you could put it on the table and
again<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.509> chop<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> go

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
again just chop around and there you go

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.810 
again just chop around and there you go
then<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:41.299> yank<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.479> open<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
then you just yank it open like that

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.139 
then you just yank it open like that
there<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.850> go

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
there you go

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.170 
there you go
