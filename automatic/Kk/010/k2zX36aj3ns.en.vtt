00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 and 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 and 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 Y 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
 and 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.430
 hello friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.710
 butter for filling of cakes that 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.990
 you can use salads and many others 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.050
 pastry the one that has easter will go 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.460
 very good to make the Easter monkey 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.790
 of the Catalan style that is always done 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.860
 with a sponge cake we are going to need the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.610
 following ingredients 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.610
 the eggs 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.050
 the sugar 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.890
 the butter 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.890
 and water 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.250
 first we are going to declare 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 the eggs 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:15.210
 once we have separated the egg whites 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.040
 of the buds we will reserve the whites and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.150
 We will use the buds for another 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.370
 thing now we'll cut the butter 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.180
 so that it does not go well 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.470
 we already have butter cut because 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 now we will pass a little bit by the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 microwave but before we will assemble the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.689
 clear we will pass the keys in a bowl 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.110
 I to mount the whites before I have not 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.590
 said but I always put a dash of 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.399
 Salt 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.689
 that way they ride us better and we'll start 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.689
 beat slowly 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.300
 well we already have the clear mounted 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.610
 point of snow to know that they are 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.410
 mounted to the point of snow we have to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.170
 turn power over and do not fall 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.820
 then it is when they are ready 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.940
 as will the butter 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.890
 microwave but very little time to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.980
 low temperature 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.030
 and we are going to put anything beginning in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
 half a minute 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.230
 in 10 minutes 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.269
 and we have butter 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.180
 about to ointment what is it that we 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.849
 interesting now we will put a dipper in the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.580
 fire where we are going to make the bolivar 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.580
 for this we will put the water 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.480
 and the sugar 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.480
 and then we'll see a little more 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.219
 we put a thermometer to see when 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.050
 we reach 120 degrees that we will stop 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.800
 right away the fire 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.430
 discovering 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.010
 more when you have already arrived 112 113 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.490
 degrees or so that we see that is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.190
 boiling you see that it is 113 of 114 more 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.060
 or less 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.239
 we'll talk about the fire 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.000
 and now in syrup we will integrate it into 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.300
 the egg whites mounted so very 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.709
 little by little go stirring with as a 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.750
 you see so very little by little and the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.070
 mixing 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.070
 and so little by little 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.880
 as if it were an airplane 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.590
 little by little we mix 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.730
 and finally 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.730
 and we will integrate the butter 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.380
 as we already have it quite undone 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.880
 we can also cut them into pieces and 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.030
 we started to beat now we can in two 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.030
 times 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.520
 we will put the rest 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.940
 and we will continue doing 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.400
 this is the texture that has caught us 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.400
 now of her and now that we were left 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.560
 a little hard we put a few minutes 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.560
 in the refridgerator 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.710
 good friends we have had our 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.480
 butter for the cakes in the 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.810
 refrigerator for one more hour or 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.460
 less and this is the texture that we have 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.470
 have to be able to make the cakes 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.590
 now I'm going to make a 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.990
 sponge cake but this will take on 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.070
 another video I hope and wish that when 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.760
 see 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:11.480
 this butter or leave so good 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.480
 cost
