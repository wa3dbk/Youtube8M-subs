00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello people by Jess and today we 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.150
 We continue to survive and crabs fashion 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.960
 not today we will do today we will do 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.030
 such a thing as 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
 electric bout electric boat she 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.679
 very interesting cool and almost not 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 requires no resources for her 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.330
 movement she's like a regular duck only 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.380
 out there is a plus that it is very fast 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.150
 dynamic here it makes iron color from 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.720
 some stuff now show you so 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 as I began to do it well, almost with 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.309
 scratch is about to make iron ovens 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.170
 did that hardened iron 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.850
 I made a collection of droplets flew please 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.079
 appeal guys then not preserved in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 overall we keep on getting get over 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.539
 hot iron can be like a clock again 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.170
 show here like we take take 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.539
 is our 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 we take our iron usually and we lay down and 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.420
 we get all of hardened iron 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.219
 here we have done here then we have done 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.090
 iron furnaces according to this scheme 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.390
 here and now what should we do next 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 we take an iron stove no we take it like this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 here we put it here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 battery but i'm full 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.610
 Well, let it be so generator turned 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 we have one 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.860
 we take also the generator we put here we put 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 here any tree is not important not important 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.470
 what kind of sticks we take it turned out 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 us water mill them turned out 2 have 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.680
 we can from the mills there does something 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.750
 type of energy but this is not today guys 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.549
 so then the water mill turned out 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.970
 us further we do as hardened and 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:42.780
 insulated copper wire 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.390
 so one thing we need and try so here 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 and it turned out we have electric 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.829
 such a light bulb turned out here 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.270
 we spent everything yes nothing now i 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.350
 all I will put that everything was neat 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.899
 I get back 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.869
 so I leave here probably yes 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.799
 leave so well let's move on now 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.409
 this night quickly and we will go in the morning 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.360
 let's go so to rush speed here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.890
 like how this one can not determine 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.679
 not worth the speedometer but it is much 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.280
 faster and generally I am our wooden ones 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.959
 shops that we have at all 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.540
 analysis of the type we put the right button 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.680
 right the same from alanya outside of us forward this 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.220
 back and just clamp w and first bye 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.050
 do not raskochegarit back and forth can 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.940
 moderators there add 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 Any topics like there like 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.900
 coal which is faster to type but 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.230
 sit down speed is typed instantly 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.910
 that is, in a couple of seconds, that is this 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.190
 speed look how we fly fast 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.100
 browse right how we fly just the same 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.110
 turn left right with the buttons 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.260
 turn the same way we can stumble 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.519
 on the obstacle and we unfortunately 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.280
 Now turning'll crash here is not particularly 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.970
 convenient here now let's turn out more 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.420
 right 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.970
 not to face let go w well here 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.190
 also if you see a type here 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.290
 these here are two cautious forces of these chickens 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 don't stumble on them like right away 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.670
 track down the boat here so follow 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.190
 and immediately if you have it ahead now 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.049
 I'll tell you this topic is called quiet 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.410
 quiet quiet 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.290
 back back click turn around 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.769
 if you are in front of you now 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.220
 I will say 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.989
 like this one that grows well 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.940
 such on the water and you can shoot down cpa 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.680
 easily right away that is they don't seem to be 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.140
 provide and here with turns 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.130
 a little bit so for the hard types here i'm 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.040
 clamp well let's turn around does not want 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.549
 she only turned around when I went out 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.970
 here we are going further and very much 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:51.640
 I wish she could do it there 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.609
 type mods there are some kind of pre-assembly 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.220
 I donâ€™t know something 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:00.880
 look here these things baba whip 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.000
 they are like mines like yes such are not immediately 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.280
 break into slivers here do if 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.370
 someone knows how or well, as the idea of pure MDA 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.360
 throws up such a type of subject to 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.620
 here on this boat 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.920
 It has been a theme like this here as well, 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.910
 our tree cut so say yes of the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.550
 shah theory 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.620
 right and left there are chests of this so you 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.270
 could lay resa and go there for their 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.620
 matters further here we are now faced with 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.450
 to the mouse aware of the terrible I survived here to me 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.190
 boat in hand she immediately hi i mean 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.890
 it disappears nowhere we can 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.710
 go out here to see this but not 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.470
 it is spent well, sort of like it with frequent 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.740
 using can take off just and 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.000
 all hours will park here 100 here 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.350
 speed you noticed very quickly 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.060
 speed so I advise you too 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.460
 try to make such a pen of tradition 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.410
 there are not too many reps on it right now 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.350
 I will show it again like this kraft 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.750
 there is of course like a type of hovering boat 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.710
 but do not generally do have rubber and 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.210
 boats even this is our map that is this 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.850
 now generally some 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.240
 Apparently, but to charge a woman's energy 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.460
 as if 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.740
 Okay, too, interesting here and then we 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.370
 this is already closer to the trolley type 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.810
 some type 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.919
 hack or some kind of round here with us 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:25.160
 such asked these pots communication 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.900
 put this why do I need in general 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.540
 interesting topic very quickly to get 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.669
 date or but also the position here there 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.010
 very quickly get over there and here I 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.710
 ran and flew that is it is certainly a lot 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.680
 time picked up that's well, something like that 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.180
 it's much more convenient and cooler will be here 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.040
 Already recovered everything so that 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.460
 serious and guys finish the series was 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.120
 I hope not very short 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.840
 say this series was guys last 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.590
 here is survival mikroft distemper will 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.440
 new episode 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.490
 so to say the new season will start here with 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.380
 I still understand the assembly as I said 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.450
 so let's see what the quick build 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.979
 may cause interest not yet well I am burning 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.510
 From the version that is, well, I probably will 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.090
 warm on that old version I understand there 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.270
 all allowed or me all the same 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.380
 help someone still get all 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.050
 port to more 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.190
 find 64 as i want either me friends 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.020
 will help 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.700

 so that I take you on one day 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.490
 I have written in this series of wood 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.980
 Ruban so I immediately write down the series then 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.280
 there is if nothing was reported to me 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.050
 as if that's so 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.990
 all the while subscribe to the channel 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.610

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.590
 look absolutely randomly here you are
