100-percent diesel just for testing

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.180 
100-percent diesel just for testing
purposes<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.020> was<00:00:51.170> doing<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:51.650> with<00:00:51.950> my

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
purposes it was doing this with my

purposes it was doing this with my
cooking<00:00:52.940> oil<00:00:53.300> blend<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:57.530> mileage

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.350 

so<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so that's a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
that is
me<00:01:12.450> quite<00:01:12.990> well<00:01:13.020> with

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.470 

have<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.430> finally<00:01:17.820> killed<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.210> injection<00:01:18.659> pump

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.710 

and<00:01:27.480> just<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.050> reference<00:01:29.090> here's<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.390> other

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and just for reference here's my other

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:43.370 
and just for reference here's my other
82<00:01:31.680> Zuzu<00:01:32.160> I<00:01:32.190> mark<00:01:33.260> run<00:01:34.260> perfectly

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.840 

see<00:01:44.380> how<00:01:44.470> much<00:01:44.680> quicker<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.250> returns<00:01:45.640> to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
see how much quicker that returns to

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
see how much quicker that returns to
idle

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.130 

and<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.770> addles<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.340> around<00:01:51.840> 800<00:01:54.720> no<00:01:55.720> exhaust

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and it addles it around 800 no exhaust

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.620 
and it addles it around 800 no exhaust
on<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.410> one<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:56.890> it's<00:01:57.040> nice<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.280> loud<00:02:00.630> but

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
on this one so it's nice and loud but

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.360 
on this one so it's nice and loud but
that's<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.020> way<00:02:02.200> my<00:02:02.440> other<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:02.740> marked<00:02:03.190> was

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
that's the way my other I marked was

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.350 
that's the way my other I marked was
running<00:02:04.080> about<00:02:05.080> two<00:02:05.290> weeks<00:02:05.470> ago<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.360> it's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
running about two weeks ago and it's

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.270 
running about two weeks ago and it's
just<00:02:07.660> been<00:02:07.810> slowly<00:02:08.229> getting<00:02:08.680> worse<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.160> worse

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
just been slowly getting worse and worse
