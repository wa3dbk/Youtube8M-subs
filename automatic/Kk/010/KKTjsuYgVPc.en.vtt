a<00:00:16.619> broken<00:00:17.369> old<00:00:17.789> computer<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> took<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.740> apart

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
a broken old computer so I took it apart

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
a broken old computer so I took it apart
check<00:00:20.400> out<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> power<00:00:20.760> supply<00:00:21.180> which<00:00:21.510> was

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
check out the power supply which was

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.679 
check out the power supply which was
still<00:00:21.869> very<00:00:22.109> functional<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.449> finally<00:00:24.449> made

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
still very functional and finally made

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.210 
still very functional and finally made
myself<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.380> lab<00:00:26.010> power<00:00:26.279> supply<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:29.099> go

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
myself a lab power supply so you can go

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
myself a lab power supply so you can go
online<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.880> instructions<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.810> many

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
online for instructions to many

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.410 
online for instructions to many
different<00:00:31.349> places<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.980> would<00:00:32.940> start<00:00:33.210> at

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
different places I would start at

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.450 
different places I would start at
instructables.com<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.040> lots<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
instructables.com they have lots of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.569 
instructables.com they have lots of
examples<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
examples so I'm not going to do a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.060 
examples so I'm not going to do a
tutorial<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.110> there's<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.530> many<00:00:40.649> already

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
tutorial because there's so many already

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
tutorial because there's so many already
but<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> wanted<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> show<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but I wanted to show you a my kind of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.209 
but I wanted to show you a my kind of
take<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:46.219> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
take on it so as you can see here so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.010 
take on it so as you can see here so
it's<00:00:47.550> plugged<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's plugged in on the back it's got the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.910 
it's plugged in on the back it's got the
master<00:00:49.379> switch<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:54.140> here's<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> little

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
master switch is on and here's a little

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.150 
master switch is on and here's a little
Arduino<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.030> an<00:00:57.149> example<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.930> added<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.620> USB

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
Arduino just as an example I added a USB

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.540 
Arduino just as an example I added a USB
port<00:00:59.600> there<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.020> added<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.649> USB<00:01:02.160> port<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
port there we go I added a USB port to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.420 
port there we go I added a USB port to
mine<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> plug<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.970> lights

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
mine so you can plug it in and it lights

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.670 
mine so you can plug it in and it lights
but<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.210> configured<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
but not only that I configured it so it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.240 
but not only that I configured it so it
will<00:01:14.540> have<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.780> doubles<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.950> world's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
will have this doubles as the world's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
will have this doubles as the world's
largest<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.960> phone<00:01:18.960> iPod<00:01:19.530> charger<00:01:24.920> there<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
largest I phone iPod charger there you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
largest I phone iPod charger there you
go<00:01:28.400> see<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.520> charging

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.310 

so<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.250> USB<00:01:36.670> port<00:01:36.970> here<00:01:37.030> by<00:01:37.660> connecting<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.290> to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
so the USB port here by connecting it to

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.240 
so the USB port here by connecting it to
the<00:01:38.650> purple<00:01:39.310> wire<00:01:40.110> inside<00:01:41.110> that's<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.800> five

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
the purple wire inside that's the five

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.450 
the purple wire inside that's the five
volt<00:01:42.550> standby<00:01:42.910> wire<00:01:43.480> that<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.320> always<00:01:44.980> putting

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
volt standby wire that is always putting

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.660 
volt standby wire that is always putting
out<00:01:45.610> five<00:01:45.940> bolts<00:01:46.470> even<00:01:47.470> when<00:01:47.680> this<00:01:48.100> isn't<00:01:48.490> on

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
out five bolts even when this isn't on

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.570 
out five bolts even when this isn't on
so<00:01:49.150> that's<00:01:49.300> why<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:50.500> access<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:51.100> all<00:01:51.400> the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
so that's why I can access this all the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.100 
so that's why I can access this all the
time<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.900> was<00:01:53.020> pretty<00:01:53.170> handy<00:01:54.120> but<00:01:55.120> I<00:01:55.420> can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
time so that was pretty handy but I can

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.070 
time so that was pretty handy but I can
get<00:01:56.910> ground<00:01:58.410> 3.3<00:01:59.410> volts<00:01:59.770> 5<00:02:00.400> volts<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:01.150> 12

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
get ground 3.3 volts 5 volts and 12

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.800 
get ground 3.3 volts 5 volts and 12
volts<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.890> ran<00:02:03.460> out<00:02:03.610> of<00:02:03.640> these<00:02:03.850> little

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
volts I ran out of these little

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.110 
volts I ran out of these little
connectors<00:02:05.170> cuz<00:02:05.770> um<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.010> could<00:02:06.460> have<00:02:06.610> put<00:02:06.910> a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
connectors cuz um I could have put a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.460 
connectors cuz um I could have put a
negative<00:02:07.930> 12<00:02:08.260> volts<00:02:08.649> also<00:02:09.160> that's<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.470> blue

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
negative 12 volts also that's the blue

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.070 
negative 12 volts also that's the blue
wire<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:11.920> here<00:02:12.130> oh<00:02:12.280> by<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.670> way<00:02:12.790> inside<00:02:13.780> here

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
wire in here oh by the way inside here

was<00:02:53.830> 12<00:02:54.610> volts<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:56.290> here's<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.650> blue<00:02:56.860> one<00:02:57.209> not

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
was 12 volts so here's the blue one not

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.880 
was 12 volts so here's the blue one not
connected<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.690> anything<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.350> left<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.769> in

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
connected to anything but I left it in

there<00:03:00.070> blue<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.670> negative<00:03:01.120> 12<00:03:01.420> volts<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.840> we

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
there blue is negative 12 volts and we

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.470 
there blue is negative 12 volts and we

indicates that all the the voltages are
ready<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.360> supposed<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.570> be<00:04:07.630> three<00:04:07.840> point

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
ready so it supposed to be three point

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:17.210 
ready so it supposed to be three point
three<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.650> close<00:04:12.060> five<00:04:13.060> volts<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.540> spot-on

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.970 

and<00:04:18.220> twelve<00:04:18.700> is<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.940> little<00:04:19.209> high<00:04:19.359> but<00:04:19.630> that's

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
and twelve is a little high but that's

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.510 
and twelve is a little high but that's
it's<00:04:20.980> close<00:04:21.130> enough<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:23.890> see<00:04:24.070> then<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.280> turn

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
it's close enough you see then you turn

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.379 
it's close enough you see then you turn
this<00:04:24.669> off<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:26.340> these<00:04:27.340> stop<00:04:27.610> working<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.300> it

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
this off and these stop working and it

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:40.890 
this off and these stop working and it
slowly<00:04:28.600> goes<00:04:28.840> down<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:37.210> even<00:04:37.390> being<00:04:37.840> off<00:04:39.900> will

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
slowly goes down but even being off will

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.300 
slowly goes down but even being off will
