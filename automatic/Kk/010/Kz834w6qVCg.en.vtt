loose
but<00:00:56.019> being<00:00:57.019> I<00:00:57.379> guess<00:00:58.070> golf<00:00:58.579> loose<00:00:59.420> is<00:00:59.809> a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
but being I guess golf loose is a

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.200 
but being I guess golf loose is a
different<00:01:00.589> feeling<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:02.620> but<00:01:03.620> keeping<00:01:04.210> your

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
different feeling so but keeping your

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.670 
different feeling so but keeping your
muscles<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.720> your<00:01:05.840> tendons<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.409> all<00:01:06.530> the

muscles and your tendons and all the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.020 
muscles and your tendons and all the
ligaments<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.100> everything<00:01:07.430> else<00:01:07.549> loose<00:01:07.820> by

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
ligaments and everything else loose by

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.289 
ligaments and everything else loose by
going<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.390> gym<00:01:08.420> that's<00:01:09.380> definite<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.000> aid

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
going to the gym that's definite and aid

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.840 
going to the gym that's definite and aid
and<00:01:11.439> helping<00:01:12.439> me<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.770> get<00:01:13.039> loose<00:01:13.189> a<00:01:13.340> lot<00:01:13.460> faster

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and helping me I get loose a lot faster

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.880 
and helping me I get loose a lot faster
plus<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.659> fact<00:01:14.869> that<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.140> 90<00:01:15.409> degrees<00:01:15.500> out

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
plus the fact that it's 90 degrees out

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.760 
plus the fact that it's 90 degrees out
doesn't<00:01:16.250> hurt<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:22.119> with<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.149> shorter<00:01:23.509> Club

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
doesn't hurt so with a shorter Club

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.859 
doesn't hurt so with a shorter Club
winds<00:01:24.770> going<00:01:25.009> left<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:25.759> I'll<00:01:26.569> actually

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
winds going left to right I'll actually

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.010 
winds going left to right I'll actually
try<00:01:27.319> and<00:01:27.350> work<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.830> ball<00:01:27.979> back<00:01:28.190> into<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.610> wind

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
try and work the ball back into the wind

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.389 
try and work the ball back into the wind
so<00:01:30.020> that's<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.409> little<00:01:30.830> better<00:01:30.950> control<00:01:31.369> your

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
so that's a little better control your

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.340 
so that's a little better control your
distance<00:01:31.940> and<00:01:32.840> better<00:01:33.319> control<00:01:33.560> your<00:01:33.649> flight

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
distance and better control your flight

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.809 
distance and better control your flight
I'll<00:01:36.350> get<00:01:36.560> my<00:01:36.649> target<00:01:37.039> whether<00:01:37.159> it's<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.399> pin<00:01:37.610> or

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
I'll get my target whether it's a pin or

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.789 
I'll get my target whether it's a pin or
something<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:39.170> I'll<00:01:39.259> just<00:01:39.440> aim<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.619> little

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
something and I'll just aim a little

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.000 
something and I'll just aim a little
right<00:01:39.950> and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
right and

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.070 
right and
put<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.670> club<00:01:41.850> face<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.480> really<00:01:42.900> just

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
put the club face just really just

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.720 
put the club face just really just
swinging<00:01:43.440> from<00:01:43.890> inside<00:01:44.220> out

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
swinging from inside out

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.960 
swinging from inside out
and<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.780> promotes<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.320> draw<00:01:46.530> very<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.790> least

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and that promotes a draw very at least

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
and that promotes a draw very at least
hold<00:01:48.210> shot<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.500> he's<00:01:49.650> going<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
hold shot and he's going that way and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
hold shot and he's going that way and
vice<00:01:50.940> versa<00:01:51.330> for<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.720> win<00:01:52.410> we're<00:01:52.560> blowing<00:01:52.800> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
vice versa for the win we're blowing the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.600 
vice versa for the win we're blowing the
other<00:01:53.010> way<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.540> would<00:01:54.540> aim<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:55.980> it<00:01:56.340> but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
other way I would aim right at it but

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
other way I would aim right at it but
then<00:01:57.140> open<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.230> the<00:01:58.350> club<00:01:58.500> face<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.860> something

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
then open up the club face of something

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.090 
then open up the club face of something
and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.520 
and
and<00:02:00.310> holds<00:02:00.580> off<00:02:00.730> so<00:02:01.350> basically<00:02:02.350> you're<00:02:02.500> just

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and holds off so basically you're just

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.320 
and holds off so basically you're just
spinning<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.370> ball<00:02:03.520> against<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.850> wind<00:02:04.120> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
spinning the ball against the wind to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.170 
spinning the ball against the wind to
hold<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:04.810> online<00:02:05.170> if<00:02:06.100> I'm<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> man<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.880> hold<00:02:07.000> it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
hold it online if I'm a man to hold it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.730 
hold it online if I'm a man to hold it
straight<00:02:07.450> I'm<00:02:08.020> gonna<00:02:08.170> aim<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.290> little<00:02:08.649> bit

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
straight I'm gonna aim a little bit

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.760 
straight I'm gonna aim a little bit
right<00:02:09.149> close<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.179> club<00:02:10.390> face<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.660> little<00:02:10.750> bit

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.110 

and<00:02:17.770> it's<00:02:17.980> staying<00:02:18.280> pretty<00:02:18.550> straight<00:02:18.850> instead

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
and it's staying pretty straight instead

I<00:02:24.250> usually<00:02:25.250> finish<00:02:25.459> off<00:02:25.760> by<00:02:26.150> hitting<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
out really well I could hit easy

I'm<00:02:34.880> supposed<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.180> look<00:02:35.360> for<00:02:35.540> if<00:02:35.630> they're<00:02:35.780> high

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
I'm supposed to look for if they're high

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
I go back to my pitching rotation if I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.730 
I go back to my pitching rotation if I
