00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.059
 hello lately I have been increasingly 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.700
 asking about whether I have a natural 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.619
 hair color and if I paint them with something like that 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.840
 Here I paint them but today I will tell 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.670
 how to do it for you but for 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.770
 start a little advice for those who have hair 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.510
 recently painted with chemical paint 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.400
 review this video a month through 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.180
 one and a half if you do not want to spoil your 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.980
 hair at all 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.050
 besides henna that treats hair 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.390
 condition them and paint when you live because 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.760
 we still need out as to give 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.050
 chocolate smell and shade cinnamon 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.059
 rather for flavor 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.840
 pepper for faster hair growth 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.550
 olive oil to care for them and 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.059
 lemon juice for legends not brightness and 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.860
 persistence in general needles not necessarily but 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.260
 I really like to chemize and watch what 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.149
 Then you get the color from the bottom in the description 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.440
 and placed a large list of spices in 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.309
 which they are divided into groups 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.450
 whichever shade it gives 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.850
 mix all the ingredients we will 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.500
 big iron bowls important in no way 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.780
 case of not taking ceramic or 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.060
 glass and then you are very, very about it 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.610
 regret taking the word first 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.459
 pour 75 grams of the year here at my hair 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.080
 should be enough then add tea 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:21.530
 a spoon of cinnamon 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.510
 fell teaspoons of pepper and a tablespoon 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.400
 cocoa 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 mix well and pour a couple 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.100
 glasses of lemon juice 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.890
 then pour a tablespoon 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.510
 olive oil and mix everything up 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.540
 csvn tsiv sour cream 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.700
 well, or swamp fluid only left 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.620
 wrap a bowl with henna cling film and 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.600
 leave her here for the night but if you 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.370
 there is no time to wait, then you can dilute henna 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.160
 let it stand for 10 minutes with boiling water 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.350
 cause while it is still warm true i would 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.240
 I do not advise you to do this because you 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.130
 the color will go bad before 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.790
 apply them on the hair you need well 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.200
 Rinse shampoo without using a balm and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.990
 when you wash the cana you need the opposite 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.250
 rinse hair with water and apply balsam 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.150
 without using shampoo 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.619
 Now you can and paint and 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.180
 I really don't know how hungry it is 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.490
 shit makes me red 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.710
 not important no really great 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.020
 I know how to make up the pigment shaft 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.790
 nods hair and blah blah blah 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.480
 but just think how liquid 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.430
 swamp color make us ginger 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.500
 In short, if you know a person who is 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.450
 joy would cause you in the mud can 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.770
 feel free to contact him for help in 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.900
 painting your hair 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.530
 but don't worry techno for you this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.300
 revenge and leave the enemy orange palms 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.980
 it now remains to wait a couple of hours but 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.500
 blondes better to wash off no later than 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.270
 about fifteen minutes but the hair is better 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.250
 put on a shower cap 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.930
 and the shoulders will cover the old towel well 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.670
 Well, the time has passed and now it is not necessary 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.050
 wash it all off your head for now 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.200
 the water will not become clear 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.110
 then apply a balm after that 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.910
 count staining for stock exchanges left 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.930
 just wait until the hair is dry 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.819
 to see the result 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.829
 Yes, I know that you can take everything and 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.939
 dry them in five minutes but I won't 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.069
 I have to do this here 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.370
 turned out color plus find healthy 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.870
 hair that you constantly want to touch 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.609
 but then I like it most 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.400
 what you can't predict what 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.090
 shade will turn out it depends on many 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.909
 factors 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.150
 what color source added something to 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.889
 how much the mixture kept and so on but here 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.469
 and all now put like if you 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.329
