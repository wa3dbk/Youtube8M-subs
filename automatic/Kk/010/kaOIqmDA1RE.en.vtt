00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.410
 Y 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.830
 hello to all 726 kids and in this 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.770
 video I will bring a protector of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.189
 screen for your desktop the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.320
 protector itself is going to rain down a 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.599
 storm on our screen and good 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.680
 I see how I have this background and the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:40.550
 true that applying this effect we give 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.590
 a nice touch to the desk so you 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.270
 I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.000
 reign screensaver and good to leave the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.360
 download link worth is this page 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.610
 you simply give it to download and good 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.400
 you have more screensavers and so on 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 you can download 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.130
 good once downloaded and so on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.550
 we execute this file that we 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.550
 will appear 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.250
 and it will charge us 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 this as it says no it's loading 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.110
 the installation wizard will disappear 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.010
 we give the next 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.080
 we say do not install this browser he 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.940
 will you choose? 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.340
 uninstall because there are you I do not 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.750
 managed to install we give the next one 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.960
 new we accept we omit this step you 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.760
 we give to next and now as you can 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 see is downloading and running 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.000
 OK 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.460
 we are going to visit it a little and I think this 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 goes quickie 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.990
 if it's going to take a little 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.730
 well, I would already give it to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.800
 close now 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.399
 and we would lack another assistant 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.459
 installation is worth then we give it to month 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.040
 and we accept and here we select the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.829
 where I want to install it I go 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 to choose another place that I already had 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.790
 assigned for this program 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.810
 month to month and good here tells us to believe 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 an icon on the desktop and what else 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.670
 we leave by default all inÃ©s 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.790
 Finalize 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.740

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.360

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.290
 no one has installed me 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.260

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.040
 Discharged 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.820

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.760
 if you were out there 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.769

 and good these two if you want 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.120
 uninstalling them has nothing to do with 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.610
 the program 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.170
 the truth that in fact I'm going to 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.440
 uninstall 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.990
 according to the video 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.980

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.980
 rain writes 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.489
 good as you can see now not 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.180
 nothing happens agree what we have 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.689
 What to do is come click on the button 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.530
 right customize and protection 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.060
 screen 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.420

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.780
 screen saver and good the only thing 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.919
 that I have is the stock there is here and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.420
 so that to see how it is 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.890
 and I do not know if I already appreciate 'aces' the sound 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.470
 of rain and if you see some small drop 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.680
 you can see it on the bottom of the desk and 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.680
 the rest 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.020

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.740
