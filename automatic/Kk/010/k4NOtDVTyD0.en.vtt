00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.330
 good morning good afternoon or good 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.090
 nights 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.779
 Friends of the whole world greets you 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.689
 imperfect teacher and in this opportunity 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.000
 we are in the preparation of one 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.370
 of the most interesting arrangements that 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.170
 will result in what is called the trilogy 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.780
 Lucky 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.239
 it was an occurrence of mine and that actually 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.600
 we would not tell ourselves but from the people 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.190
 Vallejo has a poem in which he says 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.829
 culture etc 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.539
 He leaves the village and returns to her 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.820
 then through me the 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.500
 culture of you in what I have 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.730
 I learned from people what I've done 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.860
 I have not invented, I have not discovered 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.780
 like nothing new 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 so what does this consist of is a 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.089
 Very special work to put to use 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.430
 this plant that is called by you 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.770
 locality frac in the central plant that 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.899
 is the money plant or also you 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.970
 you say monedita they also say 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.649
 millionaire in colombia then 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.570
 curiously this plant has 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.850
 spell for money not only 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.039
 in colombia in japan I found out that 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.259
 they use it in the two big buildings in 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.350
 the final part they put a glass urn 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.210
 and there you cultivate because the street to the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.710
 great billionaires we are 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 talking about anyone already very 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.610
 well let's go then to do this 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.679
 we found mesh but at a good time 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.990
 because I reminded myself of a suggestion of a 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.520
 friend that we could put coins 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.590
 you can put having to give on pot 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.299
 here but it's going to be very poor is not going to 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.759
 have a good foundation but if we put 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.289
 a sentiment an old currency that does not 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.209
 I remember what time will go túpac 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.040
 amaru I think I'm going to burn in a 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.920
 ancient coin 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.750
 just about me my friend joseph told me 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.120
 that this can cost 50 100 soles I think 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.250
 in the same ticos and this one coin 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.200
 modern since the two old ones can 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.420
 be modern side but the thing is that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.430
 be coins so that it multiplies and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 bring silver very well then the earth 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.630
 prepare litani to talk here we have the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.570
 Manjar to prepare this then 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.940
 we throw a little of that delicacy here in the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.040
 pot and let's use it is not very 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.590
 little one is not going to impress people 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.050
 no or is not going to have very little money 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.260
 let's have something more serious 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.200
 in front of a millionaire real people 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.459

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 perlite 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.580
 so now let's see the front 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.160
 she has a front and she has a lack 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.170
 Here it is clear that he has a back and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.010
 this is the train and it has a root 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 Precious case linked price 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.390
 then we are going to place this as we are going 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.150
 to put it there there more or less to see 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.739
 josé you give me a indicated one is fine or 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.650
 need I think here a little more 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.380
 wake up to see more on the right the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.090
 height height is fine to the address 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.989
 left right right 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.410
 to the right and to the more or less 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.720
 almost to the center we place them and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.670
 we fix land again I repeat that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.560
 in these cases it is necessary to press 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.569
 well the earth and because we press the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.730
 because this plant is fat has 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.099
 that quite then if you do not 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.390
 they lay the earth as soon as it can fall and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.860
 that is one of the big mistakes of 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.019
 some people who sow fortune 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.280
 face and do not squeeze the earth well 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.810

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.840
 my simple but what I've done my 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.840

 I put the plant to the right 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.440
 but I think that the plant is that 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.440
 It is called the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.460
