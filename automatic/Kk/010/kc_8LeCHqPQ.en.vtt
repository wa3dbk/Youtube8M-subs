 Spain 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.870
 was closer because we're going to put 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.250
 that you have to dance if that is the 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.480
 wardrobe let me 7 there is little 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.480
 originality in your partner 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.220
 but not every early morning some 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.810
 infection in the stomach why not 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.120
 he got infected Mr. Christ is what 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.130
 same and I do not really say that I do not know 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.770
 do and yesterday everything was fine is us 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.230
 teaching here this afternoon but dawned 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.180
 bad why not attended and now 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.590
 you have to have something to a thought 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.470
 on date 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.410
 because it's supposed to be presented 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.820

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.940

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.400

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.230
 gentlemen of touch me imagine that this is going to 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.300
 be the most complicated decision of your 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.860
 life and I really do not know what to do 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.700

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.160

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.930

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.260
