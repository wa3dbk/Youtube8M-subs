00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to make sure the seat is facing outward

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.400 
to make sure the seat is facing outward
and<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.880> way<00:03:18.030> forward<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:19.020> pull

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and is all the way forward you pull

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.620 
and is all the way forward you pull
these<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:20.220> smash<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.640> straight<00:03:21.420> down

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
these and then smash it straight down

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.110 
these and then smash it straight down
and<00:03:21.960> then<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.590> has<00:03:22.740> an<00:03:22.890> auto<00:03:23.130> block<00:03:23.430> mechanism

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and then it has an auto block mechanism

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.090 
and then it has an auto block mechanism
here<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.570> right<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> locks<00:03:25.590> right<00:03:25.770> into

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
here on the right so it locks right into
