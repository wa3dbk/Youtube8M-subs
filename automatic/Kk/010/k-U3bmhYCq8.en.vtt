they<00:01:50.159> suffered<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:50.939> injury<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.360> offensive

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
they suffered an injury at offensive

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.990 
they suffered an injury at offensive
tackle<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.380> lost<00:01:52.649> area<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.220> running<00:01:53.579> back<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
tackle or lost area of running back that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.969 
tackle or lost area of running back that
it<00:01:54.390> would<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.110> would<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> hard<00:01:55.860> time

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it would it would have a hard time

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
it would it would have a hard time
replacing<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.939> type<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> production<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.259> how

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
replacing that type of production so how

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.959 
replacing that type of production so how
long<00:01:58.469> what's<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> deal<00:01:59.219> here<00:01:59.460> because<00:01:59.790> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
long what's the deal here because you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.490 
long what's the deal here because you
know<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> alarmists<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.899> saying<00:02:01.140> he's<00:02:01.350> out

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
know the alarmists are saying he's out

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
know the alarmists are saying he's out
for<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> year<00:02:02.040> maybe<00:02:02.700> half<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> season<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.840> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
for the year maybe half the season is it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480 
for the year maybe half the season is it
too<00:02:04.079> premature<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:05.009> guess<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
too premature to really guess and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
too premature to really guess and
speculate<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> groin<00:02:07.229> injury

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
speculate on this so it's a groin injury

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
speculate on this so it's a groin injury
what<00:02:08.459> did<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.759> shred<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.840> get

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
what did you just shred it then it's get

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.930 
what did you just shred it then it's get
torn<00:02:10.229> apart<00:02:10.319> how<00:02:11.069> long<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> be

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
torn apart how long is this going to be

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.820 
torn apart how long is this going to be
out<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.840> out<00:02:12.930> for

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
out is going to be out for

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
hearing is that it should require

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.520 
hearing is that it should require

Jackson<00:03:08.260> I'm<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:08.860> buffalo<00:03:09.640> bill<00:03:09.910> fan<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.570> I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
Jackson I'm a buffalo bill fan and I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.720 
Jackson I'm a buffalo bill fan and I
think<00:03:11.200> Fred<00:03:11.440> Jackson<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.040> be<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> great<00:03:12.460> fit

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
think Fred Jackson to be a great fit

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.880 
think Fred Jackson to be a great fit
with<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> Houston<00:03:13.420> Texans<00:03:13.600> Jason<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.500> it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
with the Houston Texans Jason and it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.410 
with the Houston Texans Jason and it
seems<00:03:15.130> like<00:03:15.340> they're<00:03:15.490> showing<00:03:15.820> Fred<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.210> door

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
seems like they're showing Fred the door

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.150 
seems like they're showing Fred the door
right<00:03:16.690> now<00:03:16.870> they<00:03:17.080> drafted<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.650> running<00:03:17.950> back

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
right now they drafted a running back

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.449 
right now they drafted a running back
they<00:03:18.730> brought<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.380> LeSean<00:03:20.380> McCoy<00:03:20.459> Bryce

they brought in LeSean McCoy Bryce
Browns<00:03:21.790> would<00:03:22.060> get<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.240> lot<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.510> touches<00:03:23.020> in

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
think Fred Jackson might be on the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.280 
think Fred Jackson might be on the
outside<00:03:27.670> looking<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.420> what<00:03:28.930> do<00:03:28.990> you<00:03:29.020> think
