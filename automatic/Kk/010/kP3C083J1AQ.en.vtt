00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.975
- Hello! My name is
Tyler, I am making a video

00:00:01.975 --> 00:00:03.794
on this channel because it is my channel.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:06.387
If you like it, if you want more,

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:08.337
maybe there might be a
button that says "subscribe."

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:09.660
Click that and you will be the first

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.518
to know when I make a new video.

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:12.632
And we're moving on!

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:14.033
I don't know why I'm doing this.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.070
Today I am wearing a shirt
with constellations on it,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.331
and it glows in the dark, for the record.

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.062
I swear it works. Can
you see them? Kind of?

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.849
Yeah, you can see them. See, I told you.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:23.817
I don't lie to you. I don't lie!

00:00:23.817 --> 00:00:25.775
On the bottom, it says, "heavenly bodies,"

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.352
because I've got a heavenly body.

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:29.607
Anyway, I'm coming at you today

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:31.418
to tell you a little bit
that's going on in my life.

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:32.601
I didn't really explain VidCon.

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.519
VidCon, which was an online videomaker's

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.029
kind of conference.

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:37.583
And one of the coolest
things about VidCon was

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.001
that I got to meet so many of you.

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.925
And then these are just
people who I met at VidCon.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.963
Half of them were pictures
I took, half of them

00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:46.232
were pictures you guys
took and sent to me.

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:50.711
So yeah, if you know anybody here,

00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:55.711
you know, comment below
and tell me who you know.

00:00:56.632 --> 00:01:00.231
Just rambling at this point.

00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:03.761
P.S. Can I just say, you're about to see,

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:07.778
NigaHiga is like really hot.

00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:10.494
This girl had us all sign
her MacBook, which is sweet.

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:12.352
And then this guy was actually somebody

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:14.674
who worked at YouTube who
featured my first video

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.391
that got featured, isn't that nuts?

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:17.784
And actually, one of you subscribers

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:20.641
named Courtney came up
to me and gave me this.

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.080
Isn't this epic?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.496
The whole time was like epic beyond epic.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:25.633
And I got to meet so many people

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.491
that inspire me so
much, so it was amazing.

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:28.420
What else has been going on?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.417
I went to a Robyn concert
and Kelis opened for her.

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:31.395
And it was amazing.

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:32.933
It, by far, one of the best concerts

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:33.807
I've been to all year.

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:34.779
And actually, a couple of weekends ago,

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:37.015
I went to see Maroon 5 and V.V. Brown.

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:38.060
And they were very good.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.708
And next week, I'm
seeing Rihanna and Kesha.

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.078
Anyway, I am back in Michigan.

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:42.633
I am all moved in, I'm back in the dorms.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.513
I'm an R.A. again and I am
going into my senior year,

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:48.438
which means I am going
to be looking for a job

00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:50.969
or figure out what I'm
doing and it's very bizarre,

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.572
but I will keep you posted on that.

00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:54.336
But this was just a little vloggy vlog.

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:56.030
I wanted to catch up with you guys

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.332
and let you know what's going on

00:01:57.332 --> 00:01:58.306
because the last couple of videos,

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.328
I haven't really told you anything.

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:02.764
But until next time, have a good life

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:03.763
and I'll see you soon.

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:11.104
So, you know, just, you
know, click up there.

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:13.518
Click somewhere up there,
somewhere up above,

00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:15.423
it'll say, "subscribe" and you can do it

00:02:15.423 --> 00:02:16.909
and you can see more, that's all.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.425
That's all I'm trying to tell you!
