00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.479 
Gavin's injury will be an issue for them
but<00:03:52.379> this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> team<00:03:52.949> who<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.129> think<00:03:53.340> they<00:03:53.459> can

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
but this is a team who I think they can

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.580 
but this is a team who I think they can
fill<00:03:53.879> him<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.120> Renteria<00:03:54.599> is<00:03:54.930> healthy<00:03:55.470> again

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
fill him in Renteria is healthy again

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.500 
fill him in Renteria is healthy again
and<00:03:55.799> he's<00:03:56.069> got<00:03:56.310> five<00:03:56.549> goals<00:03:56.909> in<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.269> ten

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
and he's got five goals in just ten

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.969 
and he's got five goals in just ten
games<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:58.319> he's<00:03:58.470> been<00:03:58.590> able<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.889> play

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
games that he's been able to play

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.619 
games that he's been able to play
because<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.459> injury<00:03:59.699> problems<00:03:59.909> and<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.599> I

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
because of injury problems and so I

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.969 
because of injury problems and so I
think<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.290> Columbus<00:04:01.650> team<00:04:01.829> that

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
think that this is a Columbus team that

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.589 
think that this is a Columbus team that
knows<00:04:02.159> how<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> get<00:04:02.579> wins<00:04:02.849> especially<00:04:03.389> at<00:04:03.479> home

from<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.139> Philadelphia<00:04:04.620> standpoint<00:04:05.159> how<00:04:05.669> do

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
from a Philadelphia standpoint how do

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.969 
from a Philadelphia standpoint how do

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
they incorporate Freddy Adu will he play

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.619 
they incorporate Freddy Adu will he play
that<00:04:08.159> second<00:04:08.549> forward<00:04:08.909> will<00:04:09.090> he<00:04:09.180> play<00:04:09.419> out

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
that second forward will he play out

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.179 
that second forward will he play out
