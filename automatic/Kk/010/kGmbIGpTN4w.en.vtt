we can weaken making a sculpture with

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.620 
we can weaken making a sculpture with
silver<00:03:21.300> bronze<00:03:22.050> or<00:03:22.380> whenever<00:03:23.280> or<00:03:23.640> plastic<00:03:24.180> it

silver bronze or whenever or plastic it
will<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.959> same<00:03:25.230> shape<00:03:25.550> but<00:03:26.550> it's<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.239> it's

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
will be the same shape but it's not it's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.780 
will be the same shape but it's not it's
the<00:03:28.050> shape<00:03:28.500> itself<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.130> important<00:03:29.610> paper

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the shape itself that important paper

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.229 
the shape itself that important paper
the<00:03:30.180> ink<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.050> put<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.160> paper<00:03:32.400> so

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
the ink that you put in the paper so

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.479 
the ink that you put in the paper so
that's<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.140> point<00:03:34.290> I'm<00:03:34.650> trying<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.280> reach<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
that's the point I'm trying to reach is

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.140 
that's the point I'm trying to reach is
the<00:03:36.000> texture<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.350> quality<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
the texture it's the quality of the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.560 
the texture it's the quality of the
material<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.660> are<00:03:39.690> using<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
material you are using so you have a

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.920 
material you are using so you have a
