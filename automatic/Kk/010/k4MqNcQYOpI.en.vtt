00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 Y 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.790
 hello youtube friends I'm the 5th beat you 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.680
 3000 and today I bring you a video about the 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.930
 types of the genres that exist in 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.239
 youtube I know that this kind of videos are 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.400
 something repeated but the truth is that I 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.379
 I also wanted to do one step to 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.320
 that they know more classes of the genres 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.449
 since every time there are more we start with 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.330
 one of the locos that there is more in this 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.519
 page the critics as it says 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.160
 his name criticize everything there are picky 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.720
 they do it with very good arguments 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.489
 criticizing and analyzing the subject very well 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.040
 of which the critics speak and are 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.200
 assholes who start insulting everything 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.989
 what they criticize without thinking for example 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.479
 they say this hello today I come to talk to you 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.430
 from justin bieber that son of a bitch 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.740
 who thinks he's the best pop singer 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.530
 I should die is fucking shit 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.869
 his music is horrible and it does not work 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.780
 So shit they say they sure will have seen 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.850
 some video like this another kind of genres 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.890
 are those who do dubbing or parodies 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.789
 as you want to say about drawings 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.210
 animated video games movies songs 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.369
 etc 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.870
 some are parodies are very funny 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.300
 fun and between 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.010
 and others are made of shit by 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.350
 chito litos that only the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.570
 insults that come to mind in 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.120
 my opinion the most parodied has been the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.400
 videogame gta san andreas but do not fuck 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.800
 almost all the parodies are from that game 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.780
 there's everything there are very good parodies of 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.270
 san andreas that you create very stories 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.820
 good as the user the uctl and others 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.980
 that are made to the asshole 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.020
 Shrinks are also gamers 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.010
 speak or criticize video games and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.230
 be it good or bad 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.630
 analyze the video game with videos and everything 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.030
 they give scores to the game but not only 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.210
 that gamers also make gameplays 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.340
 but instead of his voice they put him crazy 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.410
 others that abound in this page are the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.510
 Creepy pastry shops as their name says 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.730
 they are the shopkeepers that tell creepy 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.040
 graze for those who do not know creepy 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.680
 graze are horror stories sometimes 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.510
 real and some fake are sometimes creepy 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.900
 pasta invented by the one who made the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.460
 video and others that take it out of pages 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.470
 Well, what I consider myself is the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.450
 lokeren of those who make videos of everything 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.030
 As the name they say they do videos 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.410
 from criticism to parodies make 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.020
 all kinds doing 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.140
 more entertaining as they have videos of 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.570
 all kinds are also those genres 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.500
 that criticize other users to arm 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.480
 his cyber fights ha ha ha what imbeciles 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.760
 are those that criticize users and what 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.650
 they start insulting one of the users 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.260
 most criticized is the kilo kilo that 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.300
 They begin to analyze all your videos will 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.520
 they say that fame was coming up hahaha 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.250
 and they start to say that their channel went to 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.740
 the shit others see it from the not so 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.530
 abundant are the shrinks tutorial 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.360
 istas or something like that xd are those that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 they do tutorials on how to install a 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.370
 game how to put your internet faster 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.200
 how to make a video loquendo etcetera what 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.720
 good thing is that with the voice of loquendo 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.490
 understands more the tuto and is faster 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.820
 that others all do with notebook 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.830
 notes and it becomes very slow very fast 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.750
 other lotters there are many and 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.080
 They entertain are what in the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.960
