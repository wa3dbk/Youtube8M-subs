00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.730
 samsung is currently the company that 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.560
 more cell phones in the world but she 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.500
 not only want to be known by the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.840
 volume of sales with the launch of 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.769
 galaxy alpha she wants to enter the segment 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.660
 Premium smartphone that has finished 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 differentiated but with not more hardware 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.980
 powerful 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.680
 has the company agreed with the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.440
 alpha galaxy launch you check out 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.040
 now in this video review our 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 impressions on this smartphone 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.400
 the great alpha differential is your 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.799
 design 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.769
 it does not look like any smartphone 

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:53.049
 that samsung has released until today without a doubt 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.080
 it enters the list of the most 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.269
 of the company by securing it to 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.540
 first impression we have is a 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.180
 very light product with a footprint 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.610
 comfortable and anatomical 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.030
 the device is finished in metal in the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.429
 but the removable back cover 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.649
 remains in polycarbonate to 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.990
 details such as shampoos and stripes 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.280
 that make your look 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.490
 very similar to one of the iphones 5s and 6 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.009
 inspiration that samsung does not deny the alpha 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.210
 not the most powerful device released 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.009
 by samsung 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.490
 but is far from disappointing the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.310
 consumer in this respect are two 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.679
 four-core processors added together 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.259
 to 2 GB of RAM that allow you to rotate 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:45.189
 practically everything that exists in place 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.999
 tory memory consumption 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.069
 seems to have been optimized it is less than 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.909
 than other devices in the company which 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.340
 also use the touchwiz interface 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.829
 comparing model with galaxy s 5 its 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 processing capacity are coconut 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.229
 back in benchmark tests 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.259
 still the whole is quite 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.600
 balanced beyond the traditional ceps 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.830
 you will be able to run heavier games 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.830
 no problem 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.390
 the 4.7-inch display is super 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 amoled which guarantees a final quality 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.790
 above average even though 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.220
 full hd resolution 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.310
 the device does not disappoint in this matter 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.110
 and samsung delivers a brilliant display 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.989
 and with crisp colors 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.870
 the index of reflection on the strong is 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.049
 down and look at the alpha screen is fine 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.049
 nice 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.569
 Alpha has two good cameras but they 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.980
 are not the best ever produced by 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.440
 samsung 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.470
 it seems the company has opted for a 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.299
 more balanced set delivering 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.680
 satisfactory results for the 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.750
 consumer 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.079
 the photos captured with the camera 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.200
 main features are clear and 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.470
 noise level in illuminated environments 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.200
 already in nocturnal photos the quality falls 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.230
 but the result is 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.440
 acceptable 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.489
 the alpha battery is no 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.079
 1860 milliampere hour capacity 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.019
 with which the model performs 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.599
 only regulate this question 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.470
 that is, do not expect a battery that will 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.959
 last for more than one day under no circumstances 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.269
 in normal use leaving home in the morning 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.459
 with 100% load 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.760
 You will arrive at the end of the day with 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.069
 about 20 to 30 percent of battery 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.269
 already for playing videos in a 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.549
 to be continued 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.010
 about five and a half hours are 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.569
 sufficient to drain the cargo for 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.760
 complete the galaxy lettuce where it kept 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.209
 headphones similar to those of the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.139
 galaxy 5 which guarantees good quality of 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.630
 audio 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.970
 the sound output of your smartphone is already 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.410
 located on the underside of the appliance 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.840
 and ensures a loud and clear sound but your 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.630
 positioning can cause it to 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.239
 It is covered by the hands at the time 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.109
 you are disposing making the sound more 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.109
 stuffy 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.260
 when purchasing an alpha galaxy, 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.110
 the following you are acquiring a 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.600
 premium product and will pay more for 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.620
 design and not by the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.200
 hardware 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.470
 in other words if you are looking for 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.760
 performance the galaxy s 5 is better and more 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.580
 cheap 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.650
 if you are looking for design choose the galaxy 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.390
 alpha 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.510
 although it is lower than the top of the line 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.660
 samsung to various items that make it 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.510
 Alpha use quite nice it is 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.630
 fairly lightweight and features a set of 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.790
 quality functional features 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.160
 this ensures that the consumer takes 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.400
 a product that is capable of adapting to 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.950
 any situation or other good news is 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.270
 the fact that the consumption of ram has decreased 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.550
 in this version with the touchwiz the bet of the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.160
 samsung with this device is to present 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.530
 a new option for your customers and 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.510
 undo the image once and for all 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.120
 that the company makes devices 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.750
 visually unattractive 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.700
 the alpha is undoubtedly a beautiful smartphone 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.590
 if you're willing to pay a little 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.110
 more by design 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.870
 it is worth to include this model in your 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.390
 searches at the time of purchase 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.850
 also check the analysis on the 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.850
 until our next video
