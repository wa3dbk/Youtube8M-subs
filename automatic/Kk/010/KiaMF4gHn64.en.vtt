00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.800
 the puzzle technique even that is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 basically a technique to work the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.619
 nasal back on my website you can 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.979
 see in details 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.280
 this technique I suggest to young people that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.890
 wait between 14 and 15 years for 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.210
 get an age rhinoplasty in which 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 have finished their growth until the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.750
 20 years nasal surgery is done 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.619
 basically because of big defects between 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 the 20 and 40 years is not only done by 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 large nasal defects but also 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.759
 because they want a refinement or a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.000
 retouch 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.729
 to your nose after age 40 the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.700
 Nasal surgery has not only the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.149
 aesthetic results but also 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.630
 provides a rejuvenation 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.050
 patients basically want jobs 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.899
 on the back or on its nasal tip 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.020
 to lose weight as if to assume it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.950
 little bit 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 everyone is looking for a functional part in this 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.580
 surgery and also many perform it 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.290
 because they have the need to carry 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.740
 out a functional surgery the objectives 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.550
 of a natural and harmonious result with 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.260
 Your face can be achieved

 answer what I offer my 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.430
