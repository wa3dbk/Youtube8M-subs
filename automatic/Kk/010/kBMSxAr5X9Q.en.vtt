00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
I've got my hardware for that no big

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.730 
I've got my hardware for that no big

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
days on it to optical disk drives but of

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.760 
days on it to optical disk drives but of
course<00:03:39.150> there's<00:03:39.360> only<00:03:39.450> comes<00:03:39.690> with<00:03:39.840> one<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.680> if

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
course there's only comes with one so if

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.900 
course there's only comes with one so if
I<00:03:40.860> always<00:03:41.100> want<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> put<00:03:41.459> another<00:03:41.610> one<00:03:41.790> which

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.880 
I always want to put another one which
are<00:03:42.030> likely<00:03:42.330> will<00:03:42.709> that's<00:03:43.730> an<00:03:44.730> option<00:03:47.270> go<00:03:48.890> and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
are likely will that's an option go and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.479 
are likely will that's an option go and
that's<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:51.320> so<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.830> look<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.070> there<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.340> see

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
that's it so you look in there you see
