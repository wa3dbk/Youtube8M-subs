that ignition or on or off as now in
here<00:01:23.400> tiny<00:01:24.390> switch<00:01:24.780> three<00:01:25.409> positions<00:01:25.890> again

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
here tiny switch three positions again

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
here tiny switch three positions again
there's<00:01:26.939> another<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.869> here

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there's another one in the back here

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
there's another one in the back here
that<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.380> can't<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.360> is

that we can't really see but that one is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.890 
that we can't really see but that one is
for<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.470> power<00:01:31.710> cycle<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.250> Mac<00:01:32.509> just<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.630> case<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
for to power cycle my Mac just in case I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920

need to force to restart I don't really
use<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> tiny<00:01:38.070> switch<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> back<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.970> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
use the tiny switch in the back here so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.109 
use the tiny switch in the back here so
let's<00:01:39.960> try<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.560> turn<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> system<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.670> on

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
let's try and now turn the system to on

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.249 
let's try and now turn the system to on
right<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.710> happens<00:01:44.840> try<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> zoom

it's<00:02:07.369> called<00:02:07.549> rude<00:02:07.820> buddy<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:09.369> uses<00:02:10.369> my<00:02:11.410> GPS

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it's called rude buddy it uses my GPS

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's called rude buddy it uses my GPS
receiver<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.160> back<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:14.180> give<00:02:14.360> me<00:02:14.480> an<00:02:14.569> exact

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
receiver in the back to give me an exact

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.630 
receiver in the back to give me an exact
location<00:02:15.019> it's<00:02:15.800> moving<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.160> little<00:02:16.280> bit<00:02:16.400> now

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
location it's moving a little bit now

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.289

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
cool about this radio now is that I

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.460 
cool about this radio now is that I
actually<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:47.090> radio<00:02:47.750> stations<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:48.440> I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
actually get radio stations but I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.220 
actually get radio stations but I
haven't<00:02:49.250> even<00:02:49.579> used<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.209> at<00:02:50.390> all<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.049> last

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
haven't even used it at all in the last

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
haven't even used it at all in the last
year<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:54.160> other<00:02:55.160> than<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:57.069> installed<00:02:58.069> a

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
year so other than that I installed a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.569 
year so other than that I installed a
nice<00:02:58.489> little<00:02:58.640> microphone<00:02:59.150> here<00:02:59.360> on<00:02:59.599> my<00:02:59.780> mirror

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
nice little microphone here on my mirror

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.009 
nice little microphone here on my mirror
so<00:03:02.769> my<00:03:03.769> phone<00:03:04.010> connects<00:03:04.489> via<00:03:05.420> bluetooth<00:03:05.540> to

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
so my phone connects via bluetooth to

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.289 
so my phone connects via bluetooth to
the<00:03:06.410> radio<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.459> my<00:03:07.489> conversations

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
the radio I can have my conversations

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.210 
the radio I can have my conversations
with<00:03:09.940> using<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.030> speaker's<00:03:11.389> of<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.600> car

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.509 
use to attenuate the sound it's a pretty
much<00:04:03.739> two<00:04:04.599> parallel<00:04:05.599> 8k<00:04:06.290> resistors<00:04:07.010> it's<00:04:07.400> a

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
much two parallel 8k resistors it's a

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:24.409 
much two parallel 8k resistors it's a
potential<00:04:08.060> meter<00:04:08.239> pretty<00:04:08.930> much<00:04:09.109> ah<00:04:09.669> so<00:04:10.669> yeah

I<00:04:50.300> built<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.170> about<00:04:51.530> two<00:04:51.710> years<00:04:51.860> ago<00:04:51.980> now<00:04:53.080> all

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
I built it about two years ago now all

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.700 
I built it about two years ago now all
the<00:04:54.290> cars<00:04:54.560> nowadays<00:04:55.120> have<00:04:56.120> like<00:04:56.710> integrated

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
the cars nowadays have like integrated

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.140 
the cars nowadays have like integrated
computers<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:59.060> would<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.360> do<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.660> again<00:04:59.750> huh<00:05:00.530> I

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
computers so would I do it again huh I

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.610 
computers so would I do it again huh I
don't<00:05:02.150> know<00:05:02.330> probably<00:05:02.540> not<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:03.320> was<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.470> nice

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
don't know probably not it was a nice

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.700 
don't know probably not it was a nice
project<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.130> do<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.670> challenge<00:05:05.150> for<00:05:05.570> myself<00:05:05.720> but

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
project to do a challenge for myself but

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.740 
project to do a challenge for myself but
I<00:05:06.980> guess<00:05:07.220> now<00:05:07.430> I'm<00:05:07.610> moving<00:05:07.880> on<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.540> next

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750
