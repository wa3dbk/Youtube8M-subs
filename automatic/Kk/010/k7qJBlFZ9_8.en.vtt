with silver on the outside separately

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.359 
with silver on the outside separately
i'll<00:01:10.940> make<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.050> sphere<00:01:12.440> in<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.710> center<00:01:13.220> and

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
i'll make the sphere in the center and

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.640 
i'll make the sphere in the center and
then<00:01:15.610> drill<00:01:16.610> out<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.850> holes<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.080> in<00:01:18.619> the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
then drill out the holes in the in the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.410 
then drill out the holes in the in the
glass<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.220> feed<00:01:19.460> wire<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:20.030> these<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.390> then

glass and feed wire to these and then

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.300 
glass and feed wire to these and then
this<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.660> crimped<00:01:21.170> in<00:01:21.350> place<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.130> all

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
this is crimped in place so this is all

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.230 
this is crimped in place so this is all
being<00:01:22.550> held<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.000> there<00:01:23.119> just<00:01:23.360> by<00:01:23.479> these<00:01:23.690> wires

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
being held in there just by these wires
