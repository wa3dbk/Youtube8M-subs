00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.759
 new folk ireland video it goes into the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.069
 sixth and final round of the McDonald's 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.820
 spectacular and I have again 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.590
 slammed 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 Last week I have the fifth part 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.519
 hated sometime you need too 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 take a break from the stuff 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.710
 But what does the six of us offer us ? 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.550
 get a steakhouse beef classic yet 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.050
 offered until the 6th of january 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 780 kilocalories so we go again 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.610
 down a bit and on it there is the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 Basin fans watched wheat bun 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 A picture of juicy beef 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 spicy bacon melted cheese preparation 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.200
 with shader crunchy iceberg lettuce red 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.090
 onions smoky tomato sauce me 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.710
 guess that's what the citizen is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 now stand out from the others again 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.890
 again about the sauce and that was it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.020
 Striking is my McDonald's go like that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 slowly the spectacle boxes are out there 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.170
 These standard light blue white things 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.219
 walls times the special boxes are out 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.229
 and we look in and discover 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.659
 funny patterned sesame buns so 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.670
 These planing things and we see too 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.570
 the cheese is already swelling left and right 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.330
 it's not like that now that I say 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 but rather I like it there 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 are enough salad leaves and onions there 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 in between fits behind it is too 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.430
 what about the red sauce let's get it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.159
 raus and the bude full of new 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.579
 push through as well as discover onion 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.130
 I say we are looking for the place full 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:38.670
 so in front our cheese of the twelve out 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 comes two slices of meat on the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.920
 third so three slices mini bacon yes 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.720
 so bacon fans beware one can here 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
 did not say there and then below 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.689
 underneath then this sauce and also the the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.399
 red spicy sad tomato sauce the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.229
 is also very limited as we 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.960
 has prepared had today 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.570
 does not determine a balanced day 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.000
 pretty one-sided but what do you do 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.590
 not all meal I'm looking for now 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.130
 such a juicy cheese tomato sauce 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130
 turn off 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.879
 I 'm just leaning out of it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.390
 window and claim even if you are here 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.580
 just getting equal strikes 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.730
 taste through this spicy tomato sauce 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.680
 the thing like a so is not like one 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 but there is the nearness of a victim 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.420
 or a burger at burger 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.410
 king 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.910
 they always say we fry that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.410
 maybe over open flame the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.840
 taste a bit more diligent and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.640
 This smoky tomato sauce shows what 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.260
 a little kick can be a bit 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.019
 spicy is reminiscent of gravy 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.849
 under flesh from so on this 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.950
 combination of burger king 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.530
 So maybe McDonald's has it here 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.480
 Just tried something else yes 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.819
 So I would say who burger king 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 Burger likes but max burger says this 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.180
 Labberig was at the rocker can here 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.680
 quietly access everyone else would 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.350
 I say average 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.109
 qualitative citizen slightly sharp by 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.239
 Otherwise the tomato sauce is different 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.150
 he does not care much for the others 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.280
 spectacle naturalise that's spectacle 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.019
 week missed first week missed 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.069
 fifth week left us for myself 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.349
 I think I'm beaten 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.810
 Thank you for watching a lot of fun 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.290
 imitate and see you for the next video 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.290
 chats
