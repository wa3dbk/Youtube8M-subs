00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.970
 Hello I would like to introduce myself in the book 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.740
 the book is called Schmidt's cat dogs have masters cats have staff 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.389
 one of my favorite books 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.259
 it leads so I find air loss EHEC 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.179
 but one appointed 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.280
 everything is in good shape after all, they are the least known media 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.369
 get to know each other 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.589
 he used to play three times in the brazen and a Celler street 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.699
 and it would not have been that in a game room I'm not sure 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849
 world famous 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.849
 This bunch of car might have received the credit 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.690
 Kitas book cancer suffering as paperback which I find very pity because 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.640
 that single thunderstorm St 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.630
 and my darlings finally on tour 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.839
 and being in jail just made me feel better 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.839
 or pockets Wesel for cheaper percent 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.040
 I am back and forth and that does not change 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 some first class Kassel 8 on 95 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.790
 and year demolish Hans Thoma 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.329
 there are Fischer Verlag published and LichtbÃ¤ndern Kiesbye in late May now 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 and it's quite crucial who else in the description below 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.280
 Kaegi 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.470
 It is up to us to live together between cat and human 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.250
 Jana Schmid spiked cats she is 23 years old is really violent for me 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.100
 23 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.140
 and he is not a self-runner 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.060
 around 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 Matchday coach Michael Menke had not betrayed her 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.020
 because he is following closely 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 yesterday, for example 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 such places in the book 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 "Modern Family" will be secured for five minutes 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.530
 the project here is every customer can stay at home 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.420
 Tech Anspach the Neat 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.579
 the following five minutes 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.409
 in Valencia by the resistance which are around 50 these companies has become 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.810
 largely unchanged 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.579
 because easy 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.609
 by throwing against everything we need Kelek guaranteed 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.709
 and the labor judge rooms of the trading cats 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.299
 because it turns out that you have more Schwaningen, now you have us 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 also 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.499
 So for all animal lovers general is with me is boring 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:24.969
 in plan 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:25.859
 suddenly 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.729
 Ballack belonged to his 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.349
 What does the cat actually do both deliver Mainz does he have 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.929
 and when i tell them i am at home 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:38.449
 Deuce Nussdorf to be a long way 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.469
 and 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.449
 haunt it describes the secret life of the cat, so to speak, this wholeness 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.219
 made yourself there 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.229
 that's really fun to introduce 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.469
 no more than they no longer live at home there 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.769
 and we asked against 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.639
 and eats and so on 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.910
 that makes really interesting things 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.719
 until for example cats we have to find a team 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.509
 Collar had now so far 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.999
 That's really cool with a Green Card Casino up to date 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.049
 and Japan 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.750
 then give years to set 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.229
 A bit reminds the website maker says Nehen 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.149
 and it is a diary entry from the scholar in the local Schmidt himself 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.659
 presents 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.309
 he would be a cat 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.299
 I also stay open 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.299
 he dismissed the criticism with introduce semester z 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.919
 of course it works 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.979
 So I think it's cool 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.609
 because the money did not take the human race so Kai Schmitz cat it goes 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.459
 for others too, for example 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.479
 Lemgo 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.459
 the signal is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 he can only eat if he gets fit in time 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:51.009
 but it would have to somehow two cat in the morning, the atom gets up 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.139
 and the caress 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.279
 for shops 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:59.059
 and of course, there's a really smart favorite, Alba 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:00.269
 Introduce Berlin 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.269
 It is now Game sees it is one of the super cracks drives 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.019
 Over the course of this day, one out of four people in the world has come to the point 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.509
 Middle Ages and this is not ideal zooming Gulbis scents 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:16.989
 it would 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.269
 it's kind of funny because it's exciting 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.509
 Draft horse Sterner what with diseases and everything and first future first another 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.599
 unlike it really funny 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.930
 with comics which turn 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.759
 so 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.490
 he has it with an ass 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.509
 the lie for cat lovers it really can I stay in many 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 Areas of human learning or earache like 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639
 this discretion sort of biography actually called 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.749
 Test found the eBook humor book 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.890
 so far it is important 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.640
 what he says you can be a bit over the top but it is short he leads 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.569
 I broke whole 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.740
 There are shivers recorded the Stuttgart von Red 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.090
 however, it is a bit outraged at Vitesse comics and progress 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.840
 very funny pictures and all is and drawings 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.750
 Petra Schmidt even sometimes very questionable draws I do not know 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.270

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.210

 tell them to buy track in the case 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.269
 and he at least Conrad 20 01 it is also somehow partially complements 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.430
 Oh that has also been read encrypted in print form so 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.129
