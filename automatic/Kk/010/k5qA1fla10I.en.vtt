00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
again put the truth down and give me a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:02:35.660 
again put the truth down and give me a
free<00:01:00.080> two<00:01:00.140> bottles<00:01:00.740> of<00:01:00.860> this<00:01:01.250> start

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.090 

so<00:02:36.670> that's<00:02:36.850> my<00:02:37.000> big<00:02:37.210> pocket<00:02:37.630> started<00:02:38.020> up<00:02:38.170> this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
so that's my big pocket started up this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.710 
so that's my big pocket started up this
make<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.550> thinner<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:40.360> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
make you thinner but that's it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.300 
make you thinner but that's it
obviously<00:02:41.350> just<00:02:41.530> trying<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.800> screw<00:02:42.010> off<00:02:42.160> to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.430 
obviously just trying to screw off to
fill<00:02:42.490> out<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> key<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.270> it

fill out the key and that's it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.050 
fill out the key and that's it
normally<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.130> would<00:02:45.310> turn<00:02:45.580> off<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> pitch

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
normally you would turn off the pitch

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.300 
normally you would turn off the pitch
