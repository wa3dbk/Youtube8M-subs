00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.300 
it makes perfect sense but I'm really
lucky<00:02:32.670> I've<00:02:33.120> got<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.800> naturally<00:02:34.800> occurring<00:02:35.190> in

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
lucky I've got it naturally occurring in

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.170 
lucky I've got it naturally occurring in
the<00:02:35.430> soil<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:37.400> once<00:02:38.400> i<00:02:38.520> sift<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.940> out

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the soil here and once i sift this out

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.300 
the soil here and once i sift this out
and<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.900> rock<00:02:40.050> dust<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.500> crumbles<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.070> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
and the rock dust just crumbles up and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
and the rock dust just crumbles up and
gets<00:02:41.460> in<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> soil<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.300> i<00:02:42.450> mix<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.870> with

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
gets in the soil and i mix it in with

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.170 
gets in the soil and i mix it in with
the<00:02:43.080> moss<00:02:43.770> i<00:02:44.070> mix<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.460> with<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.700> compost

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the moss i mix it in with the compost

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.440 
the moss i mix it in with the compost
the<00:02:46.050> everything<00:02:47.010> gets<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.880> good<00:02:48.150> feet

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the everything gets a really good feet

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.440 
the everything gets a really good feet
you<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> plants

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
you know and the you know the plants

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.720 
you know and the you know the plants
when<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:51.810> grow<00:02:52.020> they<00:02:52.470> grab<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.250> stuff<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
when they grow they grab this stuff and

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.550 
when they grow they grab this stuff and
it<00:02:53.820> takes<00:02:54.030> them<00:02:54.209> right<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.110> get<00:02:55.320> this

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it takes them right up and you get this

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.699 
it takes them right up and you get this
in<00:02:55.830> your<00:02:56.390> food<00:02:57.390> what's<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:57.930> body<00:02:58.170> needs<00:02:58.500> so

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
in your food what's your body needs so

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.630 
in your food what's your body needs so
you<00:02:58.800> don't<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.190> take<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.520> many

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you don't have to take as many

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.410 
you don't have to take as many
supplements<00:02:59.989> yes<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.070> like<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.970> said<00:03:03.030> this

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
supplements yes so and like I said this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.050 
supplements yes so and like I said this
whole<00:03:03.660> area

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
whole area

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.780 
whole area
is<00:03:05.360> covered<00:03:05.630> with<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:06.250> right<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.550> just

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
is covered with this right so I just

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.990 
is covered with this right so I just
basically<00:03:08.120> go<00:03:08.390> down<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:08.840> taking<00:03:09.170> Assad<00:03:10.000> sift

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
basically go down and taking Assad sift

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.530 
basically go down and taking Assad sift
it<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.300> out<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.720> then<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:14.680> refill<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.830> with

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
it all out and then I refill it with

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.910 
it all out and then I refill it with
with<00:03:18.370> leaves<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.610> stuff<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.180> buildup

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
with leaves and stuff like that buildup

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.640 
with leaves and stuff like that buildup
basically<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.099> will<00:03:22.280> be<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.430> bit<00:03:23.170> later<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.260> as

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
basically this will be a bit later on as

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.260 
basically this will be a bit later on as
well<00:03:25.269> anyway<00:03:26.269> till<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.230> next
