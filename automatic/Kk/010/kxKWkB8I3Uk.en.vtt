it between my two pieces of glass i'm
going<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.520> show<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.700> how<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.000> do<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.390> and

going to show you how to do that and
then<00:01:39.430> put<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:39.820> into<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.150> frame<00:01:41.370> let's<00:01:42.370> begin

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
then put it into the frame let's begin

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.190 
then put it into the frame let's begin
and<00:01:42.850> we're<00:01:42.940> going<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.120> do<00:01:43.240> one<00:01:43.420> together<00:01:43.630> here

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
and we're going to do one together here

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.350 
and we're going to do one together here
and<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.400> get<00:01:45.610> an<00:01:45.730> idea<00:01:45.760> of<00:01:46.030> how<00:01:46.150> it's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
and so you can get an idea of how it's

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.830 
and so you can get an idea of how it's
going<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.660> work

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
going to work

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.640 
going to work
so<00:01:47.830> i've<00:01:48.100> already<00:01:48.340> pre-cut<00:01:49.120> these<00:01:49.390> out<00:01:49.660> except

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
so i've already pre-cut these out except

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.170 
so i've already pre-cut these out except
for<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.010> one<00:01:51.160> that's<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.640> be<00:01:51.760> in<00:01:52.030> my

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
for the one that's going to be in my

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.380 
for the one that's going to be in my
back<00:01:52.450> piece<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.140> i<00:01:53.320> want<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.740> not<00:01:54.730> pre-cut

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
back piece and i want to not pre-cut

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.110 
back piece and i want to not pre-cut
that<00:01:55.570> because<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.870> want<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.170> be<00:01:56.260> pretty<00:01:56.500> exact

that because I want to be pretty exact

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.630 
that because I want to be pretty exact
so<00:01:58.120> I'm<00:01:58.300> going<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.750> just<00:01:59.020> go<00:01:59.230> ahead<00:01:59.350> take<00:02:00.340> some

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
so I'm going to just go ahead take some

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.670 
so I'm going to just go ahead take some
white<00:02:00.910> glue<00:02:01.300> I've<00:02:01.510> gotten<00:02:01.810> undesigned<00:02:02.410> glue

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
white glue I've gotten undesigned glue

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.820 
white glue I've gotten undesigned glue
right<00:02:02.950> here<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.990> I'm<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.230> going<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.650> use<00:02:05.800> my

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
right here and I'm just going to use my

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.910 
right here and I'm just going to use my
fingers<00:02:06.490> because<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.259> little<00:02:08.470> easier<00:02:08.830> and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
fingers because it's a little easier and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.499 
fingers because it's a little easier and
a<00:02:08.979> little<00:02:09.070> quicker<00:02:09.430> for<00:02:09.729> me

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
a little quicker for me

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.960 
a little quicker for me
now<00:02:11.230> if<00:02:11.500> you're<00:02:11.769> handling<00:02:12.129> glass<00:02:12.459> there<00:02:12.819> are

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
now if you're handling glass there are

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240 
now if you're handling glass there are
sharp<00:02:13.390> corners<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.530> might<00:02:14.799> even<00:02:14.829> be<00:02:15.129> a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
sharp corners and there might even be a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.839 
sharp corners and there might even be a
little<00:02:15.430> bit<00:02:16.049> rough<00:02:17.049> on<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.500> edges<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.670> make

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
little bit rough on the edges so make

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.539 
little bit rough on the edges so make
sure<00:02:18.879> you<00:02:19.120> handle<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.659> with<00:02:19.810> care<00:02:20.459> I'm<00:02:21.459> just

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
sure you handle it with care I'm just

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.280 
sure you handle it with care I'm just
going<00:02:21.909> to<00:02:21.970> take<00:02:22.150> my<00:02:22.360> glue<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:24.180> carefully

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
going to take my glue and carefully

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.850 
going to take my glue and carefully
smear<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.379> all<00:02:26.530> over<00:02:26.620> my<00:02:27.459> back<00:02:27.640> piece<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.120> glass

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.830 

I'm<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.430> take<00:02:33.730> my<00:02:34.030> sheet<00:02:34.599> of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
I'm just going to then take my sheet of

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.559 
I'm just going to then take my sheet of
paper<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.440> put<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.799> on<00:02:35.920> top<00:02:36.129> of<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.450> I'm

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
paper and put it on top of there and I'm

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.460 
paper and put it on top of there and I'm
going<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.810> line<00:02:38.079> up<00:02:38.159> two<00:02:39.159> of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.400> edges<00:02:43.470> press

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
going to line up two of the edges press

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.160 
going to line up two of the edges press
that<00:02:44.739> into<00:02:45.010> place

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.980 

and<00:02:50.260> let<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.100> dry<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:52.120> gonna<00:02:52.330> ball<00:02:52.570> up<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
and let that dry just gonna ball up the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.750 
and let that dry just gonna ball up the
glue<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.770> get<00:02:53.950> rid<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.460> off<00:02:54.580> my

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
glue so I get rid of it and off my

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.190 
glue so I get rid of it and off my
fingers<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.550> while<00:02:58.180> that's<00:02:58.360> drying<00:02:58.720> I'm

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
fingers and while that's drying I'm

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.420 
fingers and while that's drying I'm
going<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.410> go<00:02:59.530> ahead<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.010> show<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.220> how<00:03:00.370> to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
going to go ahead and show you how to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.490 
going to go ahead and show you how to
open<00:03:00.490> up<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.940> memory<00:03:01.150> frame<00:03:01.510> you're<00:03:02.320> going<00:03:02.440> to

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
open up a memory frame you're going to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.800 
open up a memory frame you're going to
see<00:03:02.620> there's<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.860> little<00:03:03.100> tab<00:03:03.490> on<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.060> top<00:03:04.090> left

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
see there's a little tab on the top left

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.900 
see there's a little tab on the top left
corner<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.590> I'm<00:03:05.890> just<00:03:06.070> going<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.520> basically

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
corner and I'm just going to basically

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.000 
corner and I'm just going to basically
open<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.290> tab<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.540> pull<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.320> frame<00:03:11.530> apart

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
open that tab and pull the frame apart

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.350 
open that tab and pull the frame apart
and<00:03:12.400> that's<00:03:13.390> all<00:03:13.660> there<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.380> hinged

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
and that's all there is and it's hinged

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.090 
and that's all there is and it's hinged
just<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.510> way<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:16.780> been<00:03:16.959> cut<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.470> scored<00:03:17.950> if

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
just the way it's been cut and scored if

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.170 
just the way it's been cut and scored if
it<00:03:18.250> makes<00:03:18.430> them<00:03:18.580> do<00:03:18.730> these<00:03:18.790> nice<00:03:19.000> little

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
it makes them do these nice little

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.750 
it makes them do these nice little
hinges<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> can<00:03:20.320> open<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.800> be<00:03:21.430> careful

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
hinges so that I can open it be careful

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.640 
hinges so that I can open it be careful
with<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.240> don't<00:03:22.480> want<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.810> distort<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.380> too

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
with it you don't want to distort it too

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.280 
with it you don't want to distort it too
much<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.730> do<00:03:24.880> want<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.360> be<00:03:25.690> gentle<00:03:25.990> with

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
much you do want to just be gentle with

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.800 
much you do want to just be gentle with
it<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.430> now<00:03:27.730> I'm<00:03:27.850> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.060> go<00:03:28.180> back<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.630> this

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
it and now I'm going to go back to this

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.690 
it and now I'm going to go back to this
I'd<00:03:29.290> probably<00:03:29.500> let<00:03:29.739> dry<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.220> bit<00:03:30.340> longer

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
I'd probably let dry a little bit longer

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.090 
I'd probably let dry a little bit longer
if<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.330> was<00:03:31.480> not<00:03:31.630> doing<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.140> camera<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:33.070> I

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
if I was not doing this on camera but I

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.770 
if I was not doing this on camera but I
do<00:03:33.250> want<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.580> speed<00:03:33.880> up<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> video<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:34.480> I'm

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
do want to speed up the video so I'm

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.620 
do want to speed up the video so I'm
just<00:03:34.959> going<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.320> very<00:03:36.310> carefully<00:03:36.610> because<00:03:37.150> it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
just going to very carefully because it

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.199 
just going to very carefully because it
is<00:03:37.900> glass<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.709> we<00:03:38.860> don't<00:03:39.040> ever<00:03:39.250> ever<00:03:39.730> want<00:03:39.940> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
is glass and we don't ever ever want to

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.240 
is glass and we don't ever ever want to
cut<00:03:40.390> glass<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.190> use<00:03:42.190> every<00:03:42.430> safety<00:03:42.910> precaution

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
cut glass so use every safety precaution

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.880 
cut glass so use every safety precaution
but<00:03:45.250> hey<00:03:45.370> I'm<00:03:45.459> going<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.640> trim<00:03:45.970> my<00:03:46.180> paper<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
but hey I'm going to trim my paper and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.160 
but hey I'm going to trim my paper and
now<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.310> back<00:03:51.580> sheet<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.209> perfectly<00:03:52.810> fitted

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
now that back sheet is perfectly fitted

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.470 
now that back sheet is perfectly fitted
and<00:03:53.350> I've<00:03:53.830> pre-cut<00:03:54.459> these<00:03:54.820> I'm<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.209> going<00:03:55.360> to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
and I've pre-cut these I'm just going to

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.750 
and I've pre-cut these I'm just going to
layer<00:03:55.720> them<00:03:56.019> on<00:03:56.230> top<00:04:02.160> okay<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.280> think<00:04:03.459> I'm<00:04:03.640> gonna

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
layer them on top okay I think I'm gonna

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.490 
layer them on top okay I think I'm gonna
like<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.239> that<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:05.049> remember<00:04:05.170> you're

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
like it like that and remember you're

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.650 
like it like that and remember you're
going<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> have<00:04:05.709> just<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.700> little<00:04:07.030> bit<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.420> the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
going to have just a little bit of the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.750 
going to have just a little bit of the
edge<00:04:07.840> that's<00:04:08.290> covered<00:04:08.769> with<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.130> frame<00:04:09.400> so

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
edge that's covered with the frame so

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.130 
edge that's covered with the frame so
keep<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:10.209> mind<00:04:10.540> when<00:04:10.720> you're<00:04:10.840> layering

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
keep that in mind when you're layering

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.699 
keep that in mind when you're layering
your<00:04:11.500> paper<00:04:12.510> if<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.660> something<00:04:14.200> is<00:04:14.320> really

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
your paper if you something is really

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.310 
your paper if you something is really
important<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.340> want<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.790> be<00:04:15.910> seen<00:04:16.320> just

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
important you want it to be seen just

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:33.409 
important you want it to be seen just
don't<00:04:17.620> put<00:04:17.830> it<00:04:17.919> right<00:04:18.100> up<00:04:18.310> against<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.850> edge

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.459 

and<00:04:34.419> like<00:04:34.539> I<00:04:34.629> was<00:04:34.659> saying<00:04:34.839> before<00:04:34.989> you<00:04:35.199> can<00:04:35.379> put

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 
and like I was saying before you can put

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.839 
and like I was saying before you can put
all<00:04:35.619> different<00:04:35.949> sorts<00:04:36.189> of<00:04:36.279> things<00:04:36.339> it<00:04:36.729> would

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
all different sorts of things it would

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.489 
all different sorts of things it would
be<00:04:36.939> the<00:04:37.029> sandwich<00:04:37.360> between<00:04:37.599> these<00:04:38.050> two<00:04:38.259> panes

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
be the sandwich between these two panes

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.199 
be the sandwich between these two panes
of<00:04:38.649> glass<00:04:38.709> you<00:04:38.889> can<00:04:39.279> do<00:04:39.399> your<00:04:39.550> child's<00:04:40.059> artwork

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:40.209 
of glass you can do your child's artwork

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:42.779 
of glass you can do your child's artwork
you<00:04:40.629> can<00:04:40.659> do<00:04:40.869> your<00:04:40.989> own<00:04:41.020> artwork<00:04:41.709> you<00:04:42.459> can<00:04:42.519> do<00:04:42.759> a

textile whatever you want to feature in

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:52.350 
textile whatever you want to feature in
your<00:04:49.899> pendant<00:04:50.469> so<00:04:51.459> I'm<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.699> going<00:04:51.939> to<00:04:52.089> trim

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
your pendant so I'm just going to trim

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.570 
your pendant so I'm just going to trim
this<00:04:52.659> again<00:04:53.619> if<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.919> wasn't<00:04:54.069> doing<00:04:54.249> that<00:04:54.459> on

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
this again if I wasn't doing that on

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.279 
this again if I wasn't doing that on
camera<00:04:54.819> I<00:04:55.059> would<00:04:55.209> probably<00:04:55.389> wait<00:04:55.839> until<00:04:55.899> it

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
camera I would probably wait until it

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.679 
camera I would probably wait until it
was<00:04:56.409> fully<00:04:56.649> dry<00:04:57.029> but<00:04:58.029> I<00:04:58.119> do<00:04:58.179> want<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.449> speed<00:04:58.659> up

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
was fully dry but I do want to speed up

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.089 
was fully dry but I do want to speed up
the<00:04:58.809> process<00:05:01.559> so<00:05:02.559> now<00:05:02.679> we're<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:02.860> gonna<00:05:02.979> take

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
the process so now we're just gonna take

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.269 
the process so now we're just gonna take
our<00:05:03.369> top<00:05:03.699> pane<00:05:04.149> of<00:05:04.300> glass<00:05:04.349> put<00:05:05.349> it<00:05:05.439> on<00:05:05.589> top<00:05:05.889> of

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:06.279 
our top pane of glass put it on top of

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.570 
our top pane of glass put it on top of
our<00:05:06.879> images<00:05:07.679> and<00:05:08.679> we<00:05:08.769> are<00:05:08.889> just<00:05:09.039> going<00:05:09.279> to<00:05:09.369> put

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
our images and we are just going to put

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.739 
our images and we are just going to put
this<00:05:09.879> into<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:11.169> frame<00:05:13.559> and<00:05:14.559> when<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:14.860> are

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:15.749 
this into the frame and when you are

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.109 
this into the frame and when you are
creating<00:05:16.749> these<00:05:16.979> take<00:05:17.979> into<00:05:18.279> account<00:05:18.580> how

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:19.119 
creating these take into account how

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.509 
creating these take into account how
much<00:05:19.509> space<00:05:19.959> you<00:05:20.229> have<00:05:20.259> how<00:05:20.679> wide<00:05:21.039> is<00:05:21.459> that

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:21.519 
much space you have how wide is that

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.159 
much space you have how wide is that
frame<00:05:22.119> how<00:05:22.300> deep<00:05:22.479> is<00:05:22.689> it<00:05:22.719> I<00:05:22.990> should<00:05:23.019> say

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
frame how deep is it I should say

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.959 
frame how deep is it I should say
because<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.129> don't<00:05:24.159> want<00:05:24.459> to<00:05:24.550> put<00:05:24.699> too<00:05:24.909> many

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
because you don't want to put too many

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.269 
because you don't want to put too many
layers<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.360> paper<00:05:25.629> or<00:05:26.199> too<00:05:26.619> thick<00:05:26.889> of<00:05:27.009> a<00:05:27.099> piece

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
layers of paper or too thick of a piece

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.489 
layers of paper or too thick of a piece
of<00:05:27.490> lace<00:05:27.669> where<00:05:28.029> it<00:05:28.149> won't<00:05:28.329> actually<00:05:28.990> fit<00:05:29.199> in

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:29.499 
of lace where it won't actually fit in

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:31.859 
of lace where it won't actually fit in
the<00:05:29.589> frame<00:05:29.909> so<00:05:30.909> now<00:05:31.059> then<00:05:31.329> we're<00:05:31.599> just<00:05:31.749> going

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:31.869 
the frame so now then we're just going

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:34.739 
the frame so now then we're just going
to<00:05:31.899> go<00:05:32.110> back<00:05:32.550> make<00:05:33.550> sure<00:05:33.579> all<00:05:33.939> our<00:05:33.969> corners<00:05:34.509> are

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:34.749 
to go back make sure all our corners are

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:40.469 
to go back make sure all our corners are
tucked<00:05:35.139> within<00:05:35.409> the<00:05:35.679> frame<00:05:38.909> and<00:05:39.909> slide<00:05:40.059> it<00:05:40.360> in

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
tucked within the frame and slide it in

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.759 
tucked within the frame and slide it in
place<00:05:40.509> let<00:05:40.929> me<00:05:41.019> show<00:05:41.199> you<00:05:41.289> that<00:05:41.409> one<00:05:41.559> more<00:05:41.649> time

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:41.769 
place let me show you that one more time

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:46.350 
place let me show you that one more time
just<00:05:42.689> see<00:05:43.689> how<00:05:43.779> that's<00:05:43.990> coming<00:05:44.379> together<00:05:45.360> and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
just see how that's coming together and

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.449 
just see how that's coming together and
then<00:05:46.479> we're<00:05:46.599> just<00:05:46.629> going<00:05:46.899> to<00:05:46.959> fold<00:05:47.289> over<00:05:47.649> the

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:48.459 
then we're just going to fold over the

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.790 
then we're just going to fold over the
tab<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:49.209> then<00:05:49.749> I've<00:05:49.929> got<00:05:50.079> a<00:05:50.110> popsicle<00:05:50.769> stick

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
tab and then I've got a popsicle stick

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.379 
tab and then I've got a popsicle stick
here<00:05:51.279> and<00:05:51.459> I'm<00:05:52.269> just<00:05:52.509> going<00:05:52.779> to<00:05:53.939> press<00:05:54.939> it<00:05:55.179> down

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
here and I'm just going to press it down

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.799 
here and I'm just going to press it down
just<00:05:55.779> to<00:05:55.929> make<00:05:56.199> sure<00:05:56.469> it's<00:05:57.339> a<00:05:57.429> nice<00:05:57.639> good<00:05:58.179> tight

00:05:58.799 --> 00:05:58.809 
just to make sure it's a nice good tight

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:02.879 
just to make sure it's a nice good tight
fit<00:05:59.169> and<00:06:00.509> there<00:06:01.509> we<00:06:01.629> go<00:06:01.779> we<00:06:02.110> just<00:06:02.139> filled<00:06:02.649> our

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
fit and there we go we just filled our

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.339 
fit and there we go we just filled our
memory<00:06:03.189> frame<00:06:03.689> you<00:06:04.689> see<00:06:04.809> how<00:06:04.959> it<00:06:05.050> looks<00:06:05.229> from

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
memory frame you see how it looks from

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.079 
memory frame you see how it looks from
the<00:06:05.529> back<00:06:05.709> and<00:06:05.979> that's<00:06:06.129> because<00:06:06.459> we<00:06:06.610> use<00:06:06.639> paper

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
the back and that's because we use paper

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.639 
the back and that's because we use paper
that<00:06:07.329> was<00:06:07.419> printed<00:06:07.839> on<00:06:07.959> the<00:06:08.110> back<00:06:08.259> so<00:06:08.529> it<00:06:08.619> looks

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:08.649 
that was printed on the back so it looks

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:11.609 
that was printed on the back so it looks
really<00:06:08.979> nice<00:06:09.249> and<00:06:09.959> there's<00:06:10.959> the<00:06:11.169> front<00:06:11.379> and

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:11.619 
really nice and there's the front and

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.109 
really nice and there's the front and
then<00:06:11.769> you<00:06:11.860> would<00:06:11.949> just<00:06:11.979> attach<00:06:12.579> that<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.879> a

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:13.119 
then you would just attach that to a

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:14.909 
then you would just attach that to a
chain<00:06:13.479> and<00:06:13.689> you<00:06:13.959> have<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.139> ready-made

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
chain and you have a ready-made

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.519
