so these are pretty interesting pretty

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.589 
so these are pretty interesting pretty
interesting<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.670> these<00:02:44.760> things<00:02:45.090> will<00:02:45.329> do

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
interesting that these things will do

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.309 
interesting that these things will do
let's<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.349> ahead<00:02:46.470> carve<00:02:46.889> one<00:02:47.069> open<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.290> take<00:02:49.290> a

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
let's go ahead carve one open and take a

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.470 
let's go ahead carve one open and take a
look<00:02:49.620> at<00:02:49.739> what<00:02:49.889> there<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> see<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.359> can

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
look at what there is to see so you can

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.229 
look at what there is to see so you can
see<00:02:51.689> it's<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.439> clear<00:02:53.069> design<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:54.180> know

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
see it's got a clear design I don't know

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.640 
see it's got a clear design I don't know
if<00:02:54.299> there's<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> light<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.109> it<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.379> must<00:02:55.530> be

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
if there's a light in it that must be

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.250 
if there's a light in it that must be
the<00:02:55.799> magnet<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.549> we<00:02:56.669> see<00:02:56.909> in<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> back<00:02:57.930> there

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the magnet that we see in the back there

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.679 
the magnet that we see in the back there
you<00:02:58.469> can<00:02:59.129> see<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.969> back<00:03:00.180> there's<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.599> little

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
bit of a magnet thing that this clicks

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.379 
bit of a magnet thing that this clicks
on<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.139> it's<00:03:04.739> got<00:03:04.889> a<00:03:04.919> nice<00:03:05.129> plastic<00:03:05.819> build

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
to it 16 gigabytes is the size that we

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.819 
to it 16 gigabytes is the size that we
have<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.359> before<00:03:09.540> us<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.079> that's<00:03:10.709> pretty

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
have here before us and that's pretty

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
what we're going to do is I'm going to

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.240 
what we're going to do is I'm going to
show<00:03:24.479> you<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.690> software<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.859> takes<00:03:26.040> and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
show you the software that it takes and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.949 
show you the software that it takes and
utilizes<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.049> do<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.199> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.379> computer

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
utilizes and do that on the computer

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.569 
utilizes and do that on the computer
okay<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.019> here's<00:03:31.349> what<00:03:31.530> makes<00:03:31.709> these<00:03:31.889> USB<00:03:32.340> is

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
okay so here's what makes these USB is

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.629 
okay so here's what makes these USB is
really<00:03:33.209> cool<00:03:33.479> as<00:03:34.349> I<00:03:34.530> said<00:03:34.590> there's<00:03:35.099> software

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
really cool as I said there's software

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.460 
really cool as I said there's software
that<00:03:35.819> you<00:03:35.879> can<00:03:36.030> get<00:03:36.180> called<00:03:36.479> the<00:03:36.540> SP<00:03:37.049> widget

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that you can get called the SP widget
