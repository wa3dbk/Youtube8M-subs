00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.780
 character as well known as ovary but 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.080

 fictitious of the saga of zelda although not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.840
 you think he's 35 years old he's 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.920
 obsessed with the fairies of the forest and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.470

 English has participated in two games 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.730
 own plus a game to archive the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.980
 English Ross breaks the English index 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 trick ball so they only debuted and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 they appeared only in Japan and Europe and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.580
 that in America the rejection towards this 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.600
 character is very high hahaha apart from 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.690
 ugly hated by all x of post 3 saves 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.640
 from the legend of zelda this character 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.280
 maybe it is the least known of the top 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.680
 but with that face aside from ugly up 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.930
 It's scary uglier than monkey's ass does not make me 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.819
 I decided whether to put it safe or to barack a 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.400
 mortal kombat in the only game that 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.590
 appears is the zelda twilight princess ni 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.840
 fucking idea if it's man or woman if 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.420
 you know in the comments tell me x from 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.030
 sorry if I do not talk much about him but it's 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.600
 I do not know as much as all 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.700
 klotho the god of war 2 this monstrous 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.890
 woman is the youngest of the very hard 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.230
 three sisters in charge of the fate of 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.490
 every living being his work consisted 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.560
 in spinning the wheel 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.810
 destiny basting the two of the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.360
 people and shaping their lives 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.400
 no fuck is uglier than hitting you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.470
 eggs when closing the door in god of war 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.630
 pilot is shown as a woman 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.190
 giant with several breasts and a body of 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.380
 shape and grayish that presents 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.590
 physical characteristics similar to 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.450
 of a silkworm as they see it now 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.710
 number one the ugliest of all 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.710
 the characters for me is 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.160
 all right 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.290
 nemesis who the fuck does not know him and does not 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.090
 has been scared with that destroyed face me 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.050
 agreement that when I found it in the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.370
 resident evil 3 I screwed up in fear x 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.260
 nemesis is one of the biological weapons 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.419
 most deadly created by the 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.669
 umbrella corporation is the following 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.080
 step in the investigations of umbrella 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.760
 is a 220 meter humanoid that is 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.040
 gigantic among its characteristics is 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.020
 include a deeply marked face 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.090
 with a scar the device that creates 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.310
 the nemesis is implanted primarily 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.900
 in the brain it also has other 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.150
 scars of interventions 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.280
 reinforcers that their clothes camouflage 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.290
 until the second part of the game a 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.850
 kind of protruding tentacles 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.280
 horribly from the back 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.070
 undary of her body Structure 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.320
 muscles and using his arm as weapons 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.030
 left is more muscular while 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.100
 the right seems more normal but 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.870
 wrapped in a tight leather case 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.960
 with numerous straps because in it 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.419
 concentrate more tentacles as I said 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.310
 before 'resident evil' 3 was his first 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.650
 Appearance would also appear in 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.870
 'resident evil' apocalypse 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.970
 to finish a curiosity of this 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.880
 monster you knew that nemesis was going to 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.710
 appear on marvel vs capcom 3 but it was 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.020
 retired for being too horrible and 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.270
 could change the rating of the game 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.710
 capcom work in the animations of 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.900
 nemesis to accommodate it in the 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.289
 rating and add it in the version 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.030
 ultimate good friends that's all I hope 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.860
 that you liked the video 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.900
 I would like you to comment if you are 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.590
 according to my top or for you there is someone 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:54.150
 more ugly than nemesis who missed chau 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.150
 dismisses the fifth truth le 3000
