00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.230
 The clutch must of course 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.380
 switch to be pressed when approaching 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.660
 this is done by the clutch pedal 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.939
 and this is over in the simplest case 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.090
 a bowden cable with the expression lever 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.000
 connected to the coupling blocks that 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.949
 that's out of reserve against the pressure plate 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.329
 expresses and thus to express the 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:45.659
 Clutch leads to something more comfortable 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.129
 vehicles or vehicles the one 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.149
 have strong against force by the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.070
 membrane spring 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.229
 There you usually build today 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.119
 hydraulic transmissions that one 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.949
 Similar to the brake system we have 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.739
 a transmitter cylinder a hydraulic 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.420
 encoder cylinder at the clutch pedal we 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.759
 have a hydraulic slave 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.100
 Cylinder at clutch bell and 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.250
 in between a hose connection and 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.869
 if you are now using a hydraulic 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.990
 reinforcing translation then work 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.369
 You can also do one with little foot force 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.140
 overcome very strong membrane spring and 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.220
 that the coupling process is thereby 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.220
 much easier 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.690
 Clutch are far 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.550
 maintenance free and still you should 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.560
 especially with mechanically operated 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.120
 clutches make sure that they are one 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.550
 clutch play have 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.510
 that can be measured on the pedal or too 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.900
 elsewhere 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.530
 that's what your manufacturer tells you 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.080
 I would not have a clutch game 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.300
 then it could be that the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.130
 Clutch game, so to speak, is negative 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.010
 So the clutch has always been something 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.510
 very little is only pressed 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.670
 that means the membrane spring would be fine 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.190
 permanently biased that out 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.500
 reserve always charged and that leads 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.180
 to that the clutch disc 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.910
 sometime begins by 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.140
 slip because the transferable 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.840
 torque of the clutch of course 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.820
 these are always less pressing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.460
 will and then the clutch will be 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.680
 even destroy the size of the 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 Clutch play the place at which 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.460
 If it is checked, this will be the experience 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.460
 from the documents of their manufacturers 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.500
 special modEls in clutch 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.230
 Of course there are also different ones 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.710
 on the one hand wants the centrifugal clutch 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.660
 call 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.520
 many of him know her from hers 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.820
 moped two wheels or small ones 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.550
 Motor devices increasing engine speed 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.870
 is coupled and the vehicle itself 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.690
 moved without having a 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.080
 need to press the clutch pedal switch 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.800
 you can usually do it but not 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.040
 the car is also semi-automatic 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.350
 circuits 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.230
 there is a source of inspiration in the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.320
 switch stick and gives a tense 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.200
 impulse to a problematic cylinder and 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.780
 which in turn affects the on the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.420
 reset at the clutch slave and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.540
 if I move the switch stick he 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.690
 Touch then uncouples the clutch 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 but that's enough for starting 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.330
 not that kind but that it is more 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.330
 to switch
