B<00:02:38.050> major<00:02:38.380> which<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.420> tonally<00:02:40.420> distant<00:02:41.020> from

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
B major which is as tonally distant from

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.949

almost<00:02:44.800> as<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.250> possibly<00:02:45.670> could<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.890> it's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
almost as it possibly could be and it's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.880 
almost as it possibly could be and it's
very<00:02:48.250> much<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.990> almost<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.170> lullaby<00:02:50.650> and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
very much like a almost a lullaby and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.690 
very much like a almost a lullaby and
when<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.970> piano<00:02:52.180> comes<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.520> commenting<00:02:54.520> on

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
when the piano comes in commenting on

when the piano comes in commenting on
the<00:02:54.820> orchestral<00:02:55.120> theme<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:56.110> really<00:02:56.440> just

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
the orchestral theme it really just

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:24.570 
the orchestral theme it really just
sounds<00:02:57.010> like<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.190> Nocturne

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.430 

the<00:03:25.580> finale<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.330> Emperor<00:03:26.630> concerto<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.410> a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the finale of the Emperor concerto is a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.730 
the finale of the Emperor concerto is a
Rondo<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:30.140> know<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.380> good<00:03:30.530> thing<00:03:30.710> about

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
Rondo and you know the good thing about

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.100 
Rondo and you know the good thing about
a<00:03:30.950> Rondo<00:03:31.400> from<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.760> musician's<00:03:32.420> standpoint<00:03:32.960> is

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
a Rondo from a musician's standpoint is

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.620 
a Rondo from a musician's standpoint is
you<00:03:33.950> learn<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.370> one<00:03:34.580> melodic<00:03:35.030> idea<00:03:35.390> and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
you learn that one melodic idea and

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.510 
you learn that one melodic idea and
learn<00:03:35.900> how<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.110> play<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.350> at<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.590> piano<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.130> it

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
learn how to play it at the piano and it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.860 
learn how to play it at the piano and it
comes<00:03:37.700> back<00:03:37.790> several<00:03:38.240> times<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:38.750> you've

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
comes back several times so you've

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.480 
comes back several times so you've
already<00:03:39.020> learned<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.590> but<00:03:40.070> in<00:03:40.340> this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
already learned it but in this

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.490 
already learned it but in this
particular<00:03:40.700> case<00:03:41.300> it's<00:03:41.570> just<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.230> difficult

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
particular case it's just so difficult

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.590 
particular case it's just so difficult
and<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.250> awkward<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.760> every<00:03:44.180> time<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.510> comes

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
and so awkward that every time it comes

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.000 
and so awkward that every time it comes
back<00:03:44.780> you're<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.170> little<00:03:45.410> bit<00:03:45.500> afraid<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.800> it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
back you're a little bit afraid of it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:04:05.310 
back you're a little bit afraid of it
but<00:03:46.430> it's<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.760> spectacularly<00:03:47.570> written<00:03:47.960> idea<00:03:48.440> I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.960
