 [Music] 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.920
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.000
 I bring you a video about how 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.220
 install xv on our ipod ipad and 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.090
 iphone 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.150
 [Music] 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 again I decided some tweet from this 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.490
 application this from here xmc is this 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.060
 the place will allow us to see movies 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.120
 online totally free of charge 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.559
 extremes for that teach as 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.489
 install them we have to go to Syria 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.200
 it is necessary to have the server made 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.460
 in our device but it's not going to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 function 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.750
 let's wait for them to carry the doubts 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 position 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.489
 let's go to the bottom of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.200
 sources and we're going to have to add a 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.579
 source 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.640
 let's see in bold 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.939
 add I'm going to leave here and here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.880
 the source appears on the screen 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.220
 do it with a job description 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.790
 to see it but this is going to be 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.790
 my rose 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.159
 point x bmc 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 dot or heretic diagonal apt 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.460
 diagonal ios duos diagonal and add 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.880
 very thin garnet font so it's not 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.430
 necessary that the rm place canceling a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.470
 Once the source was added, it will 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.710
 Apparently this team well 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.399
 xmc we select and we do not have 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.180
 that be 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.630
 these two clicks xs compact 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.990
 yxy ios the first one did not take long 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.360
 The bass is fast if it takes several 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.910
 minutes but it is necessary to be at 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.570
 two for it to work and once 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.840
 we install these two 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.300
 can I think it makes a break to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.390
 our device and before what 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.270
 did this application not appear 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 is and it does not appear with this 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.550
 interface still does not appear to us with another 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.560
 but so that it appears to us with this 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.110
 interface we need to install another other 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.330
 twit we have kinases and again 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.150
 and we will not go in the search part 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.379
 work let's write 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.409
 xb ms wizard is the one that we are going to install 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.660
 from above, it comes free in the 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.340
 red or the big box 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.210
 so it is not necessary to install any 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.040
 source or add any repo 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.760
 are taken to default when we do 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.890
 the black 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.459
 we are going to modify you are going to give in 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.040
 install and confirm that you are being 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.780
 installed the tick will you appear this 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.319
 icon this up here 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.390
 we open it and it does not appear to configure 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.300
 our devices that we have in my 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.410
 case is ipad which is an ipad min to you 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.910
 you can 17-6 it's going to be an iphone ipod 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.110
 depending on what you have 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.110
 are going to give here in configure 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.129
 after this it will take several 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.330
 minutes if it takes between this 2 to 7 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.850
 minutes more or less depending and 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.220
 after 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.350
 already after that happened we're going to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.290
 brigades and our x month in our 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.700
 application and it will look like this already or 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.720
 with this new interface 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.720
 prettier 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.920
 and well we have several 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.850
 functions but that interest us if it is 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.170
 this part of videos the students 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.750
 these are the ones that allow us to see 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.600
 favorite movies and they are in English 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.670
 but if you 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.190
