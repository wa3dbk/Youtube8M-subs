00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:12.980
 and there, everyone , everything is good, giving 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.189
 continuity to the series on 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.970
 tips about 38 paint spray gun 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.170
 I'm going to do one more general and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.570
 about some things that I left for 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.109
 behind it, I did not mention it 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.080
 previous tips on compressor there is that 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.000
 I think I'm important to you when 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.770
 Are you working with 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.579
 everything's good there, fine 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.130
 the first one the air line you go 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.460
 come across a number of ways 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.610
 here I have an example here in 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 Specialty shops are sure what you want 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.969
 have to keep in mind when you go 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.520
 buy a hose 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.090
 it will serve to feed your 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.120
 final equipment or finally be a part of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.390
 its line of area and beauty is between 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.939
 compressor and an air filter and avoid 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.999
 extension greater than 10 meters 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.709
 and between the air filter and your 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:17.299
 equipment using a bathtub 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:21.590
 avoid a distance greater than five 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.049
 meters is because I say that you have 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 accumulation of moisture and eventually the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.429
 air filter can not take all 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.439
 humidity of the air and by me but that is your 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.450
 drive unit and eventually it will 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.389
 be with god year in a very hose 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.169
 It is great until it reaches a point 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:44.919
 may it hinder the moment in the moment 

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:47.299
 What do you want to do? 

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:50.929
 as far as you want to use a 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:56.749
 spiral bath is advantageous when 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:59.809
 you have your line filter between the 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.429
 in a high place that you can 

00:01:59.809 --> 00:02:04.719
 work with her more or less in this 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.599
 position're here she comes from above and you 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:11.550
 stretch it here beauty it's not cool 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.960
 How are you with a filter? 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.450
 the opposition accepts the connector so it is and 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.270
 I see advantage in this hose here 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.490
 when you are working in a local 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.470
 close to your air filter from where you 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.740
 you are connecting an equipment 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.610
 painting is because I do not need to stay 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.650
 Holding her, it's very obvious, I need 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.110
 hold her 50 does not need to stay 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.470
 holding very well have areas that I do not 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.200
 I need to work with her always with 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.570
 she stuck in the other hand beauty then she 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.880
 becomes very useful in such cases there is a 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.310
 way the bandits can have 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.410
 notion much lighter than rubber 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.050
 it's just a big advantage because 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.960
 eventually this makes the weight together with 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.780
 the state of culture is beautiful though if you 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.990
 Will work in a very very place. 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.630
 Big you 're going to have problems here. 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.850
 because a point comes that you go 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.730
 start having to force to pull 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.130
 a guide and eventually you will not 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.700
 getting settled is a place that you are 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.010
 doing the application there then you have a 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.320
 advantage or disadvantage of 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.330
 rubber are much more flexible. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.340
 but they are heavier 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.459
 you may have some difficulty there 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.680
 with one or another good talking of the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.050
 sizing of the air gun 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.610
 A lot of people still have doubts about this. 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.170
 try a little more 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.030
 information there to get you 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.700
 choose to better scale the story 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:54.480
 culture will have a production of air 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.459
 it will have a flow of air liters per 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.450
 me very normally he will have a 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:05.180
 maximum working pressure and minimum 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.180
 professional moment that's what this means 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:43.760
 that is above consumption in a way 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.590
 that you can use the paint is in the 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:57.030
 best possible way 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:58.950
 it's both the bigger you have you got 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.500
 so you can enjoy the window 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.320
 that the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:13.590
 culture that offers there is if you 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:16.590
 works with a small maximum voucher you 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.539
 You will not be able to work with some 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.640
 materials in the paint gun because 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.590
 because eventually the pressure but 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.760
 It is always below the maximum it 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.970
 You need the area ratio while 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.850
 of art leaves paint option will also 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.570
 always be on the edge there a little 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.430
 below you in the scenario and maximum of 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.480
 use of the paint gun against 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.430
 to mp an investment fund 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.950
 and today you totally rubber- 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.530
 you will not be able to apply with 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.450
 You art teacher, there's another one. 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.390
 thing related to the guiding line you have 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.640
 loss of pressure between a point 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.070
 hose with the equipment and another 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.240
 so watch out for that either. 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:04.870
 you have to have a compressor there of 110 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.080
 s ii 120 and wanted to make a line of 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:12.520
 area and use the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.320
 90 s and 90 pounds there a tip and with 50 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.290
 meters of hose and you will not have 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.290
 right pressure right there
