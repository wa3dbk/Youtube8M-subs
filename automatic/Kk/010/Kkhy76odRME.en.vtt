00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.059
 coach there for chip to the historic 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 season went wrong I think today 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.650
 Well went wrong in 1975 you once 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 punished and they have much more than 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.910
 we who are not punished with story of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.720
 we have enough of the whole game 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.210
 contest 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 diritto draw the fifth 7% basis 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 been 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.769
 home team is completely in the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 switch played from minute 1 and 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 persistence and then you do a defensive 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.050
 field in the words you have sat for 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.510
 An error were little mistake I think if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.579
 see your second on the ball 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 percentage in so great and you 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.760
 also have the can sing of course 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 own in such a small space then plays 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 you don't get ten open jansen and then 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 Do you also know that a ballroom must be 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 fall and then detect katie balls 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 we really don't 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.129
 it was not a matter of of this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.230
 have balls that just over here just 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.660
 besides the net not 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.879
 and my their fathers a trip whistled that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.530
 should not happen 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.480
 yes that goes it will probably be there 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.689
 does not matter but with today too 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.189
 the period title is complete 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.320
 disappeared 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 we say to lose his day 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.960
 the period title now completely yes no longer 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.090
 language he heard was sitting in the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 competition for them not for us I think 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.930
 denise the contest where would you get it 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.780
 also wants to win over the leader and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.310
 at least and then I do press 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.490
 at least every activity seen 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.990
 has here in stadium and sometimes it does 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.970
 speculation he made not seen it 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.729
 even after you've seen the match 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.490
 then everyone knows that you have at least one 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.960
 point you actually earn a very 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.030
 You have a good game against it 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.479
 of a week and a fold that is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.910
 completely in the switch 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.320
 let's drink and of course yes well 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.330
 if you have an error possibility we will 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.090
 then there is punishment and then the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.369
 winner always right 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.009
 I certainly didn't think downfield was bad 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.899
 You played against better so grand 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.970
 is for that matter the disappointment 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.610
 at but still great pleasure with them and 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.679
 we argued that it was certainly feasible 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 and take those 4 points for in the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.010
 period title profiles of them but 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.950
 competitions 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.410
 absolutely not run of course send 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.150
 and that is having a match whole 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.920
 is played intensively we have the we 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.020
 who expected you to show that 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.190
 you must be the leader today 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.660
 field too we want to show but 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.660
 unfortunately not on scoreboard
