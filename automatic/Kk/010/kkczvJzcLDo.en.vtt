on 25 for example and you hit up again

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.379 
on 25 for example and you hit up again
it'll<00:02:58.780> go<00:02:58.930> back<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.290> 1

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
it'll go back to 1

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.119 
it'll go back to 1
there's<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.629> forward<00:03:02.139> and<00:03:02.230> reverse<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:03.010> then

there's the forward and reverse and then

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.670 
there's the forward and reverse and then

how<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.560> open<00:03:20.819> there<00:03:21.819> we<00:03:21.940> go

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
how to open there we go

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.319 
how to open there we go
and<00:03:23.379> this<00:03:23.829> gets<00:03:24.040> powered<00:03:24.549> by<00:03:24.729> a<00:03:24.760> single

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
and this gets powered by a single

and this gets powered by a single
triple-a<00:03:26.199> cell<00:03:27.129> battery<00:03:29.699> and<00:03:30.699> if<00:03:30.939> you<00:03:32.069> get<00:03:33.069> it

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
triple-a cell battery and if you get it

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.830 
triple-a cell battery and if you get it
out<00:03:33.250> from<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.579> library<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.329> course<00:03:34.629> you're

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
out from a library of course you're

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.300 
out from a library of course you're
responsible<00:03:35.439> for<00:03:35.620> putting<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:37.290> battery<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.680> it

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.490 

so<00:03:42.310> if<00:03:42.639> especially<00:03:42.909> if<00:03:43.359> it's<00:03:43.629> a<00:03:43.810> rechargeable

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
give it back and then on this edge here

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.369 
give it back and then on this edge here
we<00:03:49.209> have<00:03:49.479> a

you'd like to put it into some other

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.719 
you'd like to put it into some other

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
form save getting it right out of the

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:18.700 
form save getting it right out of the
earphone<00:07:17.150> but<00:07:17.780> of<00:07:17.900> course<00:07:18.110> don't<00:07:18.290> do<00:07:18.530> that

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
earphone but of course don't do that

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.219 
earphone but of course don't do that
unless<00:07:18.889> you<00:07:19.040> unless<00:07:19.880> you<00:07:20.060> own<00:07:20.300> it<00:07:20.479> legally<00:07:22.150> and
