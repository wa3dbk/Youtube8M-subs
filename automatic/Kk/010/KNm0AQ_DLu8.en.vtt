00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
hair and the shape that I want it so my

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.769 
hair and the shape that I want it so my
hair<00:06:09.250> is<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.550> little<00:06:10.090> bit<00:06:10.270> darker<00:06:10.960> than<00:06:11.830> the

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
hair is a little bit darker than the

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.709 
hair is a little bit darker than the
extensions<00:06:13.779> but<00:06:14.440> that's<00:06:15.370> okay<00:06:16.000> it's<00:06:16.330> still<00:06:16.659> a

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
extensions but that's okay it's still a

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:23.430 
extensions but that's okay it's still a
little<00:06:17.110> bit<00:06:17.409> damp<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:18.389> the<00:06:19.389> front<00:06:20.099> but<00:06:22.440> it's

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
little bit damp in the front but it's

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.430 
little bit damp in the front but it's
working<00:06:24.069> I<00:06:24.719> think<00:06:25.719> that<00:06:25.870> this<00:06:25.990> hair<00:06:26.199> looks

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
working I think that this hair looks

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.920 
working I think that this hair looks
super<00:06:26.889> natural<00:06:27.069> I<00:06:27.580> haven't<00:06:27.969> had<00:06:28.150> any<00:06:28.479> issues

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
super natural I haven't had any issues

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.439 
super natural I haven't had any issues
with<00:06:28.960> it<00:06:29.199> yet<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.919> do<00:06:30.039> experience<00:06:30.819> a<00:06:31.210> little

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
with it yet I do experience a little

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.779 
with it yet I do experience a little
shedding<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.169> little<00:06:32.560> bit<00:06:32.680> of<00:06:32.770> tangling<00:06:33.279> but

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
shedding a little bit of tangling but

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.999 
shedding a little bit of tangling but
that's<00:06:34.000> expected<00:06:34.629> with<00:06:34.779> curly<00:06:35.259> hair<00:06:35.289> the

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
that's expected with curly hair the

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.779 
that's expected with curly hair the
texture<00:06:36.580> of<00:06:36.789> it<00:06:37.210> is<00:06:37.419> very<00:06:38.259> natural-looking<00:06:39.190> I

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
texture of it is very natural-looking I

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.629 
texture of it is very natural-looking I
was<00:06:40.180> expecting<00:06:40.810> it<00:06:40.960> to<00:06:41.020> be<00:06:41.139> super<00:06:41.800> silky<00:06:42.129> since

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
was expecting it to be super silky since

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.890 
was expecting it to be super silky since
it's<00:06:42.819> your<00:06:43.000> age<00:06:43.150> in<00:06:43.360> here<00:06:43.599> but<00:06:43.810> that's

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
it's your age in here but that's

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.990 
it's your age in here but that's
definitely<00:06:44.289> not<00:06:44.650> the<00:06:45.099> case<00:06:45.310> with<00:06:45.550> this<00:06:45.729> hair

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
definitely not the case with this hair
