00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.870 
like he has all this food so I think
there's<00:01:36.289> no<00:01:36.439> way<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.770> 32<00:01:37.189> teams<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.670> past

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
there's no way the 32 teams in the past

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.719 
there's no way the 32 teams in the past
the<00:01:38.179> first<00:01:38.780> round<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.679> think<00:01:40.039> t-bo's<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.700> a

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
the first round so I think t-bo's have a

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.160 
the first round so I think t-bo's have a
big<00:01:40.970> day<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.149> sorry<00:01:41.539> I<00:01:41.690> think<00:01:41.899> you're<00:01:41.990> going<00:01:42.110> to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
big day on sorry I think you're going to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.260 
big day on sorry I think you're going to
see<00:01:42.319> his<00:01:42.530> stock<00:01:43.310> continue<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.819> improve<00:01:44.030> as<00:01:44.179> he

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
see his stock continue to improve as he

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.669 
see his stock continue to improve as he
gets<00:01:44.420> more<00:01:44.600> comfortable<00:01:45.049> running<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.380> new<00:01:45.500> kind

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
gets more comfortable running a new kind

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.350 
gets more comfortable running a new kind
of<00:01:45.799> offense<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.429> I<00:01:46.700> think<00:01:47.119> you're<00:01:47.209> going<00:01:47.330> to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
of offense and I think you're going to

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.760 
of offense and I think you're going to
see<00:01:47.420> him<00:01:47.600> go<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.899> first<00:01:48.080> round<00:01:48.319> somewhere

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
see him go in the first round somewhere

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.230 
see him go in the first round somewhere
but<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.100> been<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> good<00:01:49.490> week<00:01:49.549> for<00:01:49.729> those<00:01:50.000> two

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
but it's been a good week for those two

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.609 
but it's been a good week for those two
and<00:01:50.420> they're<00:01:50.899> looking<00:01:51.049> forward<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.440> playing

and they're looking forward to playing

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.990 
and they're looking forward to playing
