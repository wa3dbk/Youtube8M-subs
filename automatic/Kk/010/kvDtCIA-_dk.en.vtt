gets in the way everything gets in the
way<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.140> finally<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.460> regret<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
way and so finally I'm gonna regret that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.279 
way and so finally I'm gonna regret that
because<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> finally<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.690> brushed<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.110> into

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
because I finally just brushed it into

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
because I finally just brushed it into
like<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:53.010> brushed<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> way

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
like so this was brushed by the way

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
like so this was brushed by the way
that's<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> looked<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.719> anyway

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that's what that looked like anyway

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
that's what that looked like anyway
finally<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.690> decided<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.930> needed

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
finally I decided that I needed

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
finally I decided that I needed
something<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.859> help<00:00:59.010> me<00:00:59.219> visually<00:00:59.879> keep<00:01:00.120> track

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of every day and this idea I think I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100
