00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
on the keiki fusion emulator

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.269 
on the keiki fusion emulator
this<00:00:19.080> requires<00:00:19.410> game<00:00:19.650> genie<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.160> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
this requires game genie which is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.620 
this requires game genie which is
actually<00:00:20.550> already<00:00:20.700> built<00:00:21.000> inside<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> Emily

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
actually already built inside the Emily

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.269 
actually already built inside the Emily
or<00:00:21.750> anyway<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.890> there's<00:00:23.099> no<00:00:23.250> other

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
or anyway so you know there's no other

downloads<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.240> anything<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.439> just

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
downloads or anything like that it just

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
downloads or anything like that it just
requires<00:00:26.070> simply<00:00:26.369> copy<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.670> paste<00:00:26.790> code<00:00:27.270> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
requires simply copy and paste code and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
requires simply copy and paste code and
then<00:00:27.750> add<00:00:27.869> code<00:00:28.079> and<00:00:28.259> then<00:00:28.349> you're<00:00:28.470> done<00:00:28.619> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
then add code and then you're done so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
then add code and then you're done so
really<00:00:29.430> we<00:00:29.579> need<00:00:29.700> sadistic<00:00:30.029> file<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.810> then

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
really we need sadistic file and then

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.170 
really we need sadistic file and then

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
scroll down to game genie adds code and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.490 
scroll down to game genie adds code and
then<00:00:33.360> yeah<00:00:33.780> that's<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.170> need<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> do

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
I'll pull all the two codes in the

description I'll tell you what codes I'm

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889 
description I'll tell you what codes I'm
using<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.820> while<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.270> right

now I'm just going to show you what red
sonic<00:00:41.430> looks<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.630> we<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.809> right

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
sonic looks like so here we are right

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
sonic looks like so here we are right
now<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.829> game<00:00:43.980> believes<00:00:44.370> window<00:00:44.730> calls<00:00:44.940> but

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
now the game believes window calls but

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.340 
now the game believes window calls but
no<00:00:45.390> we're<00:00:45.570> ready<00:00:45.750> Sonic

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
no we're ready Sonic

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
no we're ready Sonic
that's<00:00:46.710> why<00:00:46.890> sonic<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.370> red<00:00:47.579> because

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that's why sonic is red because

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.770 
that's why sonic is red because
obviously<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.440> polite<00:00:49.800> clear<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
obviously it was polite clear is a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.910 
obviously it was polite clear is a
commonly<00:00:51.780> explained<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.109> really<00:00:52.410> don't<00:00:52.620> ever

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
commonly explained I really don't ever

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
commonly explained I really don't ever
yeah<00:00:53.339> we're<00:00:53.699> ready<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.329> game<00:00:54.480> things

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
yeah we're ready because the game things

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.989 
yeah we're ready because the game things
miracles<00:00:55.109> that's<00:00:55.260> all<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.500> say<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.850> yeah

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
miracles that's all I can say but yeah

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.610 
miracles that's all I can say but yeah
it<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.449> lead<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.839> some<00:00:58.140> rather<00:00:58.320> unusual

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it can lead to some rather unusual

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.759 
it can lead to some rather unusual
things<00:00:59.550> such<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.620> because<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.679> know

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
things such as because you know

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.100 
things such as because you know
obviously<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.280> Sonic<00:01:02.670> therefore<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.989> know

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
obviously with Sonic therefore you know

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
obviously with Sonic therefore you know
the<00:01:04.409> game<00:01:04.620> you<00:01:04.920> won't<00:01:05.370> be<00:01:05.430> able<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.610> pass<00:01:05.820> some

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the game you won't be able to pass some

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
the game you won't be able to pass some
obstacles<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.960> come<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.320> knuckles<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
obstacles that we come with knuckles so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
obstacles that we come with knuckles so
I'm<00:01:08.670> using<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> code<00:01:09.120> right<00:01:09.300> now<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.840> called

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I'm using a code right now it's called

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990 
I'm using a code right now it's called
look<00:01:10.230> with<00:01:10.350> his<00:01:10.470> ID<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.580> does<00:01:11.640> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
look with his ID now what this does is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.840 
look with his ID now what this does is
it<00:01:12.420> gives<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.230> Sonic's<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.670> gives

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it gives all of Sonic's and it gives

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
it gives all of Sonic's and it gives
locals<00:01:15.150> abilities<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> sonic<00:01:16.020> -<00:01:16.920> flying<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
locals abilities to sonic - flying the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.999 
locals abilities to sonic - flying the
gliding<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.570> means<00:01:18.810> sonic<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.380> go

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
gliding which means sonic can now go

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
gliding which means sonic can now go
through<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> rocks<00:01:21.180> knuckles

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
through the you know the rocks knuckles

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
through the you know the rocks knuckles
can<00:01:21.780> which<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.310> let<00:01:23.549> us

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
can which can actually you know let us

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.920 
can which can actually you know let us
proceed<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> game<00:01:24.299> instead<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> getting

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
proceed with the game instead of getting

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.330 
proceed with the game instead of getting
stuck<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.470> game-breaking

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
stuck and game-breaking

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
stuck and game-breaking
this<00:01:27.210> code<00:01:27.420> also<00:01:27.600> lets<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.079> fight<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> boss

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
this code also lets you fight the boss

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
this code also lets you fight the boss
battles<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.689> because<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
battles with because you know if you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
battles with because you know if you
don't<00:01:31.350> add<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> Fate<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.070> code<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.969> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
don't add to Fate this code then you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.060 
don't add to Fate this code then you
know<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> can't<00:01:33.719> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> Robotnik

looks<00:01:40.439> really<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:40.829> awesome<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.369> love<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

red<00:01:41.909> Sonic<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.360> look<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.960> cool<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.259> mean<00:01:43.560> I'm

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
red Sonic you look so cool I mean I'm

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
red Sonic you look so cool I mean I'm
not<00:01:44.070> quite<00:01:44.250> sure<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.640> works<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
not quite sure if this works with a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.590 
not quite sure if this works with a
hypersonic<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.619> assume<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.360> but<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
hypersonic I assume it would but it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.029 
hypersonic I assume it would but it
might<00:01:48.780> look<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> tad<00:01:49.200> glitching<00:01:49.649> I'm<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.860> quite

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
might look a tad glitching I'm not quite

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.560 
might look a tad glitching I'm not quite
sure<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:50.789> it<00:01:51.270> just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
sure I just can see right here it just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
sure I just can see right here it just
looked<00:01:51.719> pretty<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.320> she<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.920> we're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
looked pretty good she because we're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.370 
looked pretty good she because we're
using<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> knuckles<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> ID<00:01:54.570> thing<00:01:54.899> if

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
using the knuckles of the ID thing if

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590 
using the knuckles of the ID thing if
you<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:55.590> use<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.859> knuckles<00:01:56.130> ID<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.850> he

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you don't use the knuckles ID then he

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.029 
you don't use the knuckles ID then he
just<00:01:57.780> looks<00:01:57.960> normal<00:01:58.289> but<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> said<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
just looks normal but like I said you

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.139 
just looks normal but like I said you
will<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> able<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.759> through<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> game

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
will not be able to get through the game

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.929 
will not be able to get through the game
even<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:00.899> devolve<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> does<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.649> work<00:02:01.939> but

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
even with devolve it does not work but

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.160 
even with devolve it does not work but
yeah<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.329> was<00:02:03.479> pretty<00:02:03.600> happy<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> find<00:02:04.049> out

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
yeah I was pretty happy to find out

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.420 
yeah I was pretty happy to find out
about<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.680> mean<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:05.039> pretty<00:02:05.280> sure

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
about this I mean I'm pretty sure

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.499 
about this I mean I'm pretty sure
there's<00:02:05.609> other<00:02:05.729> videos<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.149> YouTube<00:02:06.240> about

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
there's other videos on YouTube about

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.650 
there's other videos on YouTube about
this<00:02:06.859> but<00:02:07.859> there's<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.660> indicates

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
this but there's not one which indicates

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
this but there's not one which indicates
it's<00:02:09.960> specifically<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.590> red<00:02:11.400> super<00:02:11.610> sonic

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it's specifically for red super sonic

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's specifically for red super sonic
and<00:02:12.600> I'm<00:02:12.690> pretty<00:02:12.870> sure<00:02:13.020> all<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.320> would

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and I'm pretty sure all of you would

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
and I'm pretty sure all of you would
enjoy<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.390> pretty<00:02:15.570> sure

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
enjoy this but and I'm pretty sure

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
enjoy this but and I'm pretty sure
there's<00:02:15.870> quite<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> few<00:02:16.230> color<00:02:16.770> codes<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
there's quite a few color codes on the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.010 
there's quite a few color codes on the
internet<00:02:17.490> as<00:02:17.580> well<00:02:17.610> which<00:02:18.180> means<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.720> you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
internet as well which means that you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.540 
internet as well which means that you
can<00:02:19.140> only<00:02:19.260> change<00:02:19.560> them<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.070> anything<00:02:20.280> really

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
can only change them to anything really

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.990 
can only change them to anything really
mean

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
mean

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.870 
mean
there's<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.240> light<00:02:21.450> blue<00:02:21.660> Sonic<00:02:22.020> code<00:02:22.880> well

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
there's a light blue Sonic code well

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.040 
there's a light blue Sonic code well
actually<00:02:24.000> I'm<00:02:24.210> not<00:02:24.240> quite<00:02:24.510> sure<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.690> mean<00:02:24.960> I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
actually I'm not quite sure I mean I

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.840 
actually I'm not quite sure I mean I
know<00:02:25.110> there's<00:02:25.350> one<00:02:25.410> dark<00:02:26.100> sonic<00:02:26.460> which<00:02:26.640> looks

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
know there's one dark sonic which looks

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.520 
know there's one dark sonic which looks
really<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:27.300> awesome<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.810> might<00:02:28.320> try<00:02:28.440> that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
really really awesome I might try that

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.250 
really really awesome I might try that
one<00:02:28.740> day<00:02:28.890> by<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.130> plane<00:02:29.370> not<00:02:29.490> yet<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.360> yeah<00:02:30.840> so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
one day by the plane not yet but yeah so

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.290 
one day by the plane not yet but yeah so
the<00:02:31.350> codes<00:02:31.560> I'm<00:02:31.650> using<00:02:31.800> right<00:02:31.980> now<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.430> all

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the codes I'm using right now is all

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.910 
the codes I'm using right now is all
Chaos<00:02:33.630> Emeralds<00:02:34.080> which<00:02:34.230> obviously<00:02:34.500> grants<00:02:34.860> us

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
Chaos Emeralds which obviously grants us

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.410 
Chaos Emeralds which obviously grants us
the<00:02:34.950> ability<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.400> turn<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:35.790> super<00:02:36.090> sonic<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the ability to turn into super sonic it

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.460 
the ability to turn into super sonic it
saves<00:02:36.630> us<00:02:36.750> from<00:02:36.810> collecting<00:02:37.320> all<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
saves us from collecting all the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.290 
saves us from collecting all the
emeralds<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.280> bill<00:02:38.459> thing<00:02:38.670> I've

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
emeralds just to do this bill thing I've

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.850 
emeralds just to do this bill thing I've
also<00:02:39.450> got<00:02:39.630> eighty<00:02:39.780> rings<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.680> always

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
also got eighty rings in so you always

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.620 
also got eighty rings in so you always
have<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.190> two<00:02:41.250> ring<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.790> you'll<00:02:41.970> always<00:02:42.150> always

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
have a two ring so you'll always always

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.330 
have a two ring so you'll always always
be<00:02:42.810> able<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.680> change<00:02:43.890> into<00:02:44.130> Super

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
be able to you know change into Super

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.880 
be able to you know change into Super
Sonic<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.820> also<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.320> disable<00:02:46.800> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
Sonic I also have you know disable the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.650 
Sonic I also have you know disable the
music<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:47.670> don't<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.240> deal<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
music so we don't have to deal with that

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.020 
music so we don't have to deal with that
really<00:02:49.110> really<00:02:49.530> annoying<00:02:50.030> hypersonic

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
really really annoying hypersonic

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.479 
really really annoying hypersonic
supersonic<00:02:51.480> music<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.190> know<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.400> pretty

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
supersonic music so you know it's pretty

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.340 
supersonic music so you know it's pretty
hard<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.880> find<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.209> code<00:02:54.450> because<00:02:54.900> honestly

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
hard to find that code because honestly

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.680 
hard to find that code because honestly
it<00:02:55.830> would<00:02:55.980> drive<00:02:56.190> me<00:02:56.220> insane

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
it would drive me insane

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.199 
it would drive me insane
I<00:02:57.720> also<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:58.470> 99<00:02:58.830> lives<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.430> as<00:02:59.550> well<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
obviously read sonic as well but I'll

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.710 
obviously read sonic as well but I'll
