significant portions of the film we felt

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.899 
significant portions of the film we felt
the<00:02:00.200> best<00:02:00.409> result<00:02:00.799> was<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.130> do<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.280> wet<00:02:01.640> gate

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
the best result was to do a wet gate

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.770 
the best result was to do a wet gate
scan<00:02:06.009> there<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.250> special<00:02:07.549> liquid<00:02:08.149> then<00:02:08.599> we'll

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
scan there is special liquid then we'll

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.289 
scan there is special liquid then we'll
take<00:02:08.959> all<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.140> scratches<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.299> basically

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
take all the scratches and basically

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.630 
take all the scratches and basically
erase<00:02:11.599> them<00:02:14.170> as<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.530> film<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.190> scanner

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
erase them as the film is on the scanner
