this<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.810> know<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.799> push<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.580> clip

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
this you know up this way push the clip

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
this you know up this way push the clip
in<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.530> because<00:01:16.530> running<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> belt

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
in more because running this on a belt

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060 
in more because running this on a belt
if<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.450> running<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.259> over<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> belt

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
if you're running it just over the belt

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
if you're running it just over the belt
it<00:01:20.340> does<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> tendency<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> little

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it does have a tendency to be a little

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.460 
it does have a tendency to be a little
loose<00:01:22.710> possibly<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.939> slide<00:01:24.659> around<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
loose possibly so slide around back and

forth and you know that could create

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
forth and you know that could create
somewhat<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.490> problem<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.210> you're<00:01:31.140> trying

there's a v-shape cut out and I can't

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.170 
there's a v-shape cut out and I can't
tell<00:03:13.560> if<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:13.890> just<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> same<00:03:14.489> material<00:03:15.030> as

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
tell if it's just the same material as

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.830 
tell if it's just the same material as
the<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.600> tied<00:03:15.959> X<00:03:16.170> polymer<00:03:16.770> here<00:03:17.540> or<00:03:18.540> if

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the as the tied X polymer here or if

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.000 
the as the tied X polymer here or if
it's<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.140> some<00:03:19.350> kind<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.620> rubberized

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it's like some kind of rubberized

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.330 
it's like some kind of rubberized
coating<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.910> there<00:03:21.120> feels<00:03:22.049> rubbery<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.769> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
coating in there feels rubbery and it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.759 
coating in there feels rubbery and it
definitely<00:03:23.820> snugs<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.049> tight<00:03:25.350> but

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
definitely snugs it in tight but

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.610 
definitely snugs it in tight but

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
as a as a utility blade the edge would

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.579 
as a as a utility blade the edge would
work<00:05:21.759> very<00:05:22.060> nice<00:05:22.330> for<00:05:22.629> that<00:05:22.779> but<00:05:23.139> at<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.409> same

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:23.589 
work very nice for that but at the same

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.070 
work very nice for that but at the same
time<00:05:23.919> you<00:05:24.460> mainly<00:05:25.089> would<00:05:25.300> be<00:05:25.419> carrying<00:05:25.870> this

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
the CR you know stainless steels or you

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.649 
the CR you know stainless steels or you
know<00:05:42.669> steels<00:05:43.000> like<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:44.699> they<00:05:45.699> do<00:05:45.759> dull<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> lot

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
know steels like that they do dull a lot

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.959 
know steels like that they do dull a lot
easier<00:05:47.139> than<00:05:47.349> higher<00:05:47.589> higher<00:05:48.219> grade<00:05:48.580> Steel's

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
easier than higher higher grade Steel's

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.570 
easier than higher higher grade Steel's
but<00:05:49.599> they<00:05:49.719> also<00:05:49.899> are<00:05:50.439> a<00:05:50.469> little<00:05:50.680> bit<00:05:50.889> softer<00:05:51.370> so
