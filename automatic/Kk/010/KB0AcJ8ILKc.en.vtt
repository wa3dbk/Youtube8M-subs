kneeling<00:00:21.200> on<00:00:21.320> coup<00:00:21.500> stick<00:00:21.560> songs<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.400> chords

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
kneeling on coup stick songs the chords

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.730 
kneeling on coup stick songs the chords
are<00:00:22.970> very<00:00:23.180> simple<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:24.140> it's<00:00:24.290> all<00:00:24.470> in<00:00:24.650> the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
are very simple but it's all in the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.300 
are very simple but it's all in the
field<00:00:25.040> and<00:00:25.400> largely<00:00:25.760> largely<00:00:26.330> comes<00:00:26.689> from

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.960 

so<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:33.140> is<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.440> acoustic<00:00:33.650> version<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.490> down

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
so this is the acoustic version of down

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.600 
so this is the acoustic version of down
by<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.270> river<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:37.250> only<00:00:37.340> difference

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
by the river and the only difference

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.100 
by the river and the only difference
being<00:00:37.700> this<00:00:37.880> and<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.210> electric<00:00:38.540> version<00:00:38.960> is

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
being this and the electric version is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.730 
being this and the electric version is
the<00:00:39.710> tuning<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.250> she<00:00:40.430> is<00:00:40.490> so<00:00:40.960> this<00:00:41.960> is<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.470> D

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
the tuning that she is so this is the D

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.890 
the tuning that she is so this is the D

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
which says the six and the first strings

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.049 
which says the six and the first strings
are<00:00:48.260> both<00:00:48.380> 20<00:00:48.680> day<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.130> D<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:52.670> rest<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.970> it

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
are both 20 day so D and the rest of it

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:06.270 
are both 20 day so D and the rest of it
is<00:00:53.210> standard<00:00:53.630> tuning<00:01:01.150> it's<00:01:02.150> a<00:01:02.270> 3<00:01:02.570> D<00:01:02.780> tuning<00:01:04.059> 3ds

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
is standard tuning it's a 3 D tuning 3ds

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.220 
is standard tuning it's a 3 D tuning 3ds
and<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.520> take<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> chord<00:01:08.030> like<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.270> which

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
and so you take a chord like this which

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.170 
and so you take a chord like this which
is<00:01:09.380> an<00:01:09.500> E<00:01:09.650> minor<00:01:09.920> 7th<00:01:10.430> it's<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.820> normal

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
is an E minor 7th it's the normal

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.810 
is an E minor 7th it's the normal
fingering<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.470> do<00:01:12.680> in<00:01:13.220> standard<00:01:13.670> tuning

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
fingering that you do in standard tuning

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.210 
fingering that you do in standard tuning
of<00:01:14.150> an<00:01:14.270> E<00:01:14.420> minor<00:01:14.570> 7th<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.260> it<00:01:15.770> gives<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.190> very

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
of an E minor 7th and it gives it a very

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.840 
of an E minor 7th and it gives it a very
different<00:01:16.700> color<00:01:17.420> because<00:01:17.690> of

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
different color because of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.790 
different color because of
nc<00:01:20.480> entertaining<00:01:20.990> these<00:01:21.170> two<00:01:21.380> notes<00:01:21.590> would<00:01:21.740> be

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
nc entertaining these two notes would be

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.340 
nc entertaining these two notes would be
ease<00:01:22.700> but<00:01:23.260> ok<00:01:24.260> so<00:01:24.770> down<00:01:25.280> by<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.490> river<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:27.110> has

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
ease but ok so down by the river it has

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.850 
ease but ok so down by the river it has
