00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
for it and it turned out to be a bit

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
for it and it turned out to be a bit
difficult<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.820> mean<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> letters<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
difficult I mean the letters that I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
difficult I mean the letters that I
ended<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.320> coming<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.920> work<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.370> mean<00:01:02.820> I'm

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
ended up coming up with work I mean I'm

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
ended up coming up with work I mean I'm
satisfied<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> fact<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.379> didn't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
satisfied with the fact that I didn't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 
satisfied with the fact that I didn't
sketch<00:01:05.010> him<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.309> whatever<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.850> um<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:07.080> was

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sketch him or whatever but um it was

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
sketch him or whatever but um it was
tough<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.939> obviously<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> would<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.049> been

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
tough and I obviously I would have been

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.710 
tough and I obviously I would have been
done<00:01:10.770> better<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.240> letters<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.600> have

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
done better or the letters would have

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.350 
done better or the letters would have
been<00:01:12.840> cleaner<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.740> could<00:01:14.580> erase<00:01:15.030> some<00:01:15.330> stuff

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
been cleaner if I could erase some stuff

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
been cleaner if I could erase some stuff
and<00:01:15.720> whatever<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.470> definitely<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and whatever but that was definitely a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.270 
and whatever but that was definitely a
challenge<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.820> itself<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.750> um<00:01:19.070> we<00:01:20.070> each<00:01:20.250> just

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
challenge in itself so um we each just

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
challenge in itself so um we each just
use<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.450> pen<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.140> black<00:01:22.380> marker<00:01:22.740> or

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
use a one pen or like black marker or

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.630 
use a one pen or like black marker or
whatever<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.200> went<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.890> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
whatever and went from there and then we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780 
whatever and went from there and then we
said<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.180> color<00:01:27.860> for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> outline<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.549> mean
