00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
really my own just what I've heard from

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.160 
really my own just what I've heard from
a<00:00:11.310> lot<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.490> players<00:00:11.850> and<00:00:12.180> some<00:00:12.600> of<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> notes<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
a lot of players and some of the notes I

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
a lot of players and some of the notes I
didn't<00:00:13.470> quite<00:00:13.680> figure<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.100> right<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.820> I'm

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
didn't quite figure out right so I'm

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.189 
didn't quite figure out right so I'm
doing<00:00:15.090> it<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.300> little<00:00:15.450> differently<00:00:15.840> than<00:00:16.080> other

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
doing it a little differently than other

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.570 
doing it a little differently than other
people<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.760> think<00:00:18.510> there<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.550> lot<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
people and I think there are a lot of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.189 
people and I think there are a lot of
cooler<00:00:21.210> versions<00:00:21.900> than<00:00:22.200> my<00:00:22.440> ending<00:00:22.860> so<00:00:24.020> be<00:00:25.020> my

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:01:14.470 

okay<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> whole<00:00:45.540> thing

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:24.370 

I<00:01:22.300> don't<00:01:23.300> always<00:01:23.450> play<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.960> same<00:01:24.200> way

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
I don't always play it the same way

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.020 
I don't always play it the same way
every<00:01:24.590> time

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
every time

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.070 
every time
and<00:01:26.030> there<00:01:26.150> was<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> couple<00:01:26.480> wrong<00:01:26.690> notes<00:01:26.900> in

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
and there was a couple wrong notes in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.960 
and there was a couple wrong notes in
there<00:01:27.230> but<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.070> general<00:01:28.460> gist<00:01:28.730> I'm

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
there but that's the general gist I'm

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.120 
there but that's the general gist I'm
also<00:01:29.180> doing<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.600> very<00:01:29.780> boring<00:01:30.170> bowing<00:01:30.830> I'm

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
also doing a very boring bowing I'm

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.270 
also doing a very boring bowing I'm
doing<00:01:31.520> slur<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.330> separate<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.470> slur<00:01:33.950> to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
doing slur to separate to slur to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.880 
doing slur to separate to slur to
separate<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.320> because<00:01:36.320> it's<00:01:36.500> not<00:01:36.650> really

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
separate to because it's not really

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.950 
separate to because it's not really
boring<00:01:37.130> when<00:01:37.370> you're<00:01:37.490> going<00:01:37.610> fast<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.810> it's

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
boring when you're going fast but it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.990 
boring when you're going fast but it's
kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.290> predictable<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.010> it's<00:01:40.520> nice<00:01:40.760> to

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
kind of predictable and it's nice to

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.040 
kind of predictable and it's nice to
throw<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.950> separate<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:43.160> slur<00:01:43.880> 3<00:01:44.300> because

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
throw in a separate one slur 3 because

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.370 
throw in a separate one slur 3 because
that<00:01:45.170> really<00:01:45.380> gives<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.830> bump<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.370> kind<00:01:46.880> of

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
that really gives a bump and kind of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.620 
that really gives a bump and kind of
shakes<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.530> up<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.740> little<00:01:48.920> bit<00:01:49.100> ok<00:01:49.430> play<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.450> one

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
shakes it up a little bit ok play it one

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.780 
shakes it up a little bit ok play it one
more<00:01:50.660> time<00:01:51.050> for<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.250> it's<00:01:52.490> just<00:01:52.610> up

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
more time for you and then it's just up

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.280 
more time for you and then it's just up
to<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.060> look<00:01:53.180> at<00:01:53.270> my<00:01:53.360> hand<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:53.930> kind<00:01:54.200> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
to you to look at my hand and kind of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.220 
to you to look at my hand and kind of
figure<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:54.800> out<00:01:55.480> in<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.630> next<00:01:56.690> video<00:01:57.080> I'll

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
figure it out in the next video I'll

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.110 
figure it out in the next video I'll
play<00:01:57.440> up<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.650> full<00:01:57.950> speed<00:01:58.160> so<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.580> can<00:01:58.700> see<00:01:58.940> how

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
play up to full speed so you can see how

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:47.080 
play up to full speed so you can see how
it<00:01:59.270> sounds<00:01:59.660> fast<00:01:59.930> ok<00:02:00.230> here<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.770> go

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.410 

okay<00:02:48.090> couple<00:02:48.659> of<00:02:48.810> things<00:02:49.019> there<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:50.420> there

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
okay couple of things there was a there

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.149 
okay couple of things there was a there
was<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.540> first<00:02:51.810> finger<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.439> covers<00:02:52.769> both<00:02:53.099> the

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
was a first finger that covers both the

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.289 
was a first finger that covers both the
D<00:02:54.000> string<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.959> string<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:57.209> at

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
D string and the a string and then at

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.750 
D string and the a string and then at
the<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.420> ending<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:59.159> kind<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.430> did<00:02:59.610> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the very ending I just kind of did this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.330 
the very ending I just kind of did this
little<00:03:01.609> two-in-one<00:03:02.609> pattern<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.040> one<00:03:05.310> on

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
little two-in-one pattern it's a one on

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.380 
little two-in-one pattern it's a one on
the<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.640> string<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:06.390> two<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.170> E<00:03:07.200> string

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
the a string a two on the E string

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.210 
the a string a two on the E string
and<00:03:09.390> then<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.599> would<00:03:09.750> played<00:03:10.019> open<00:03:10.230> strings<00:03:10.829> and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.550 

that's<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.370> two<00:03:14.609> on<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> string<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:16.170> three

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
that's a two on the a string and a three

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:26.479 
that's a two on the a string and a three
on<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.040> E<00:03:17.069> string<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:26.010> know<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
on the E string so and I know that the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.280 
on the E string so and I know that the
open<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.209> open<00:03:27.450> E<00:03:27.569> don't<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:28.049> fit

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
open a and the open E don't really fit

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.410 
open a and the open E don't really fit
into<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.680> chord<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.549> goes<00:03:29.730> by<00:03:29.909> so<00:03:29.939> fast

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
into the chord but it goes by so fast

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.869 
into the chord but it goes by so fast
it's<00:03:30.870> just<00:03:31.230> sounds<00:03:31.859> kind<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.129> cool<00:03:32.400> when<00:03:32.730> it's

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
it's just sounds kind of cool when it's
