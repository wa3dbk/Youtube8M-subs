an hour and a half but as always the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.630 
an hour and a half but as always the

best way to tell when our roast has
reached<00:01:11.880> medium-rare<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> meat

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
reached medium-rare is to use a meat

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
reached medium-rare is to use a meat
thermometer<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> we'll<00:01:14.310> insert<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> into

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
thermometer so we'll insert that into

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
thermometer so we'll insert that into
the<00:01:15.180> thickest<00:01:15.570> part<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> beef<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
plated it now when we slice our roast

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.679 
plated it now when we slice our roast
remember<00:01:47.880> we're<00:01:48.030> always<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> carve

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
remember we're always going to carve

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.090 
remember we're always going to carve
against<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> grain<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.649> here's<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
against the grain so here's what that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.999 
against the grain so here's what that
means<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.090> grain<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.540> running<00:01:51.810> lengthwise<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
means the grain is running lengthwise so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
means the grain is running lengthwise so
we're<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> slice<00:01:53.670> against<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
we're going to slice against it so that

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
we're going to slice against it so that
each<00:01:55.049> bite<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:55.920> tender<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.729> easier

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
each bite is more tender and even easier

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600 
each bite is more tender and even easier
