00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389

this<00:04:21.570> great<00:04:21.900> wind<00:04:22.500> split<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.130> people<00:04:23.610> ask

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
this great wind split in it people ask

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.730 
this great wind split in it people ask
me<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.030> know<00:04:24.150> where<00:04:24.449> does<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:25.260> kink<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
me you know where does the kink and the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.650 
me you know where does the kink and the
grill<00:04:25.979> come<00:04:26.220> from<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:27.300> something

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
grill come from and it's something

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.620 
grill come from and it's something
that's<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:28.350> been<00:04:28.680> subtle<00:04:29.550> on<00:04:29.760> Jeep<00:04:30.120> vehicles

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
that's it's been subtle on Jeep vehicles

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.870 
that's it's been subtle on Jeep vehicles
to<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.050> past<00:04:31.320> but<00:04:31.800> we've<00:04:31.979> really<00:04:32.190> amplified

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
to the past but we've really amplified

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.420 
to the past but we've really amplified
it<00:04:33.060> here<00:04:33.360> in<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.750> much<00:04:33.900> more<00:04:34.110> modern<00:04:34.500> way<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it here in a much more modern way the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.600 
it here in a much more modern way the
lights<00:04:35.699> are<00:04:36.090> lifted<00:04:36.570> up<00:04:36.690> high<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.199> front

lights are lifted up high in the front

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.980 
lights are lifted up high in the front
you'll<00:04:38.610> see<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.120> actual<00:04:39.540> headlights

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
you'll see that the actual headlights

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.990 
you'll see that the actual headlights
are<00:04:40.199> lower<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.710> there's<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.400> daytime<00:04:41.760> running

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
are lower and there's a daytime running

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
are lower and there's a daytime running
light<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.389> higher<00:04:42.630> when<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.470> vehicle<00:04:43.830> is

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
light up higher when the vehicle is

light up higher when the vehicle is
driving<00:04:44.430> those<00:04:44.699> those<00:04:45.090> lights<00:04:45.330> are<00:04:45.479> always

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
driving those those lights are always

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.960 
driving those those lights are always
lit<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.800> sets<00:04:47.100> up<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> signature<00:04:47.790> of

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
lit and it it sets up the signature of

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.909 
lit and it it sets up the signature of
the<00:04:48.120> front<00:04:48.330> end<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.630> vehicle<00:04:48.770> when<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.800> go

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
the front end of the vehicle when you go

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.070 
the front end of the vehicle when you go
down<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.280> side<00:04:50.520> there's<00:04:50.850> pieces<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.330> Jeep

that<00:04:53.040> are<00:04:53.160> probably<00:04:53.580> more<00:04:53.910> subtle<00:04:54.389> most

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
that are probably more subtle most

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.680 
that are probably more subtle most

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
an element that the designers picked up

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.770 
an element that the designers picked up
