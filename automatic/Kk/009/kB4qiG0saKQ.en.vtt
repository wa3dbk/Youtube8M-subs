left<00:01:02.039> nostril<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.440> would<00:01:07.590> recommend<00:01:08.130> doing

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
left nostril and I would recommend doing

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.290 
left nostril and I would recommend doing

that for about five minutes or two to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.510 
that for about five minutes or two to
five<00:01:12.540> minutes<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
five minutes and it it's sort of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.630 
five minutes and it it's sort of
activates<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:16.040> parasympathetic<00:01:17.040> nervous

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
activates the parasympathetic nervous

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
activates the parasympathetic nervous
system<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> nervous<00:01:18.360> system<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:18.900> relaxes

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
system the nervous system that relaxes

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.920
