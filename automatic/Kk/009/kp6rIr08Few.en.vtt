but how do they taste so I guess
technically<00:03:02.079> all<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.469> mine<00:03:02.680> would<00:03:02.889> go<00:03:03.040> into

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
technically all of mine would go into

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.309 
technically all of mine would go into
this<00:03:03.430> little<00:03:03.609> variances<00:03:04.239> every<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.109> of<00:03:05.139> them

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
this little variances every one of them

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.119 
this little variances every one of them
variables

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129
