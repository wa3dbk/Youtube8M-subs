00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.160 
custom white balance and when you use
custom<00:02:06.929> white<00:02:07.110> balance<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.590> nothing<00:02:08.310> changes

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
custom white balance and nothing changes

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
custom white balance and nothing changes
in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.380> inside<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> camera<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.880> your

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
in the inside of the camera but your

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.440 
in the inside of the camera but your
color<00:02:12.870> changes<00:02:13.590> well<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.580> scary<00:02:14.970> because

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
color changes well that's scary because

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:39.160 
color changes well that's scary because
that's<00:02:15.599> not<00:02:15.780> supposed<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.110> happen

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.449 

so<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> spent<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.620> lot<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.799> time<00:02:40.889> this<00:02:41.310> week

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
so I spent a lot of time this week

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.280 
so I spent a lot of time this week
investigating<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.269> problem<00:02:42.840> i<00:02:42.930> talked<00:02:43.200> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.250 
investigating this problem i talked to
my<00:02:43.409> colleagues<00:02:43.950> i<00:02:44.129> sent<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.549> photos<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.389> half

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
my colleagues i sent the photos to half

help<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:52.220> eventually<00:02:53.220> talked<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> buddy<00:02:54.510> of

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
help I eventually talked to a buddy of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.649 
help I eventually talked to a buddy of
mine<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:56.340> photographer<00:02:57.329> for<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
mine that is a photographer for the

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.390 
mine that is a photographer for the
Olympic<00:02:58.169> Oval<00:02:58.290> he<00:02:58.620> used<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.859> actually<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.189> one

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
Olympic Oval he used to actually be one

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.979 
Olympic Oval he used to actually be one
of<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.549> official<00:02:59.970> photographers<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.510> and

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
of the official photographers there and

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.170 
of the official photographers there and
I<00:03:01.889> asked<00:03:02.220> him<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.459> know<00:03:02.489> what's<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.879> white

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
I asked him you know what's the white

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.000 
I asked him you know what's the white
balance<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.200> building<00:03:04.650> how<00:03:04.799> do<00:03:04.859> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
balance in that building how do you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.069 
balance in that building how do you
handle<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.790> he<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:06.299> laughed<00:03:06.629> out<00:03:07.049> loud

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
handle that and he just laughed out loud

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.849 
handle that and he just laughed out loud
and<00:03:07.620> he<00:03:07.709> said<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:07.980> me<00:03:08.250> guess<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.560> there<00:03:10.560> are

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
and he said to me guess what there are

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.149 
and he said to me guess what there are
four<00:03:11.459> different<00:03:11.819> kinds<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.719> lights<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.560> that

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
four different kinds of lights in that

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.470 
four different kinds of lights in that
building<00:03:14.840> mercury<00:03:15.840> vapor<00:03:16.459> fluorescent

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
building mercury vapor fluorescent

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.770 
building mercury vapor fluorescent
halogen<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.659> tungsten<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.700> color<00:03:21.180> goes

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
halogen and tungsten so that color goes

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.460 
halogen and tungsten so that color goes
all<00:03:22.139> over<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.829> place<00:03:23.599> so<00:03:24.599> what<00:03:24.810> was<00:03:24.959> happening

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
all over the place so what was happening

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.379 
all over the place so what was happening
was<00:03:25.829> when<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.099> was<00:03:26.310> using<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.819> fast<00:03:27.180> shutter

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
was when I was using a fast shutter

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.319 
was when I was using a fast shutter
speed<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.109> 1-800<00:03:28.680> or<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> 15<00:03:29.699> hundredth

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
speed so the 1-800 or the 15 hundredth

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.559 
speed so the 1-800 or the 15 hundredth
of<00:03:30.389> a<00:03:30.510> second<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.220> was<00:03:32.220> hitting<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:33.000> lights<00:03:33.269> as

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
of a second I was hitting the lights as

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.599 
of a second I was hitting the lights as
they<00:03:33.810> were<00:03:33.870> flickering<00:03:34.319> at<00:03:34.829> different

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
they were flickering at different

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.309 
they were flickering at different
frequencies<00:03:35.790> because<00:03:36.419> as<00:03:36.659> you<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:36.840> like

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
frequencies because as you know like

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.750 
frequencies because as you know like
specially<00:03:37.739> fluorescent<00:03:38.250> lights<00:03:38.400> lights

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
specially fluorescent lights lights

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.379 
specially fluorescent lights lights
aren't<00:03:39.599> constant<00:03:40.319> they<00:03:40.590> flicker<00:03:41.129> so<00:03:41.909> if<00:03:42.150> one

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
aren't constant they flicker so if one

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.869 
aren't constant they flicker so if one
photo<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.989> taken<00:03:43.019> Wendy<00:03:43.889> fluorescent<00:03:44.669> light

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
photo was taken Wendy fluorescent light

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.750 
photo was taken Wendy fluorescent light
was<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.470> next<00:03:47.310> photo<00:03:47.489> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
was on and the next photo the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.149 
was on and the next photo the
fluorescent<00:03:48.269> light<00:03:48.419> was<00:03:48.659> off<00:03:48.959> well<00:03:49.680> then<00:03:49.859> the

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
fluorescent light was off well then the

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.249 
fluorescent light was off well then the
color<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.609> going<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.090> be<00:03:51.180> different<00:03:51.419> in<00:03:51.870> those

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
color is going to be different in those

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.259 
color is going to be different in those
two<00:03:52.560> photos<00:03:52.949> even<00:03:53.159> though<00:03:53.519> they're<00:03:53.759> taken

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
two photos even though they're taken

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.280 
two photos even though they're taken
less<00:03:54.509> than<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> second<00:03:55.470> apart<00:03:56.389> so<00:03:57.389> I<00:03:57.689> was<00:03:58.079> really

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
less than a second apart so I was really

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.159 
less than a second apart so I was really
happy<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.909> wasn't<00:04:00.329> operator<00:04:00.870> error

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
happy that it wasn't operator error

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.409 
happy that it wasn't operator error
because<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.919> would<00:04:02.009> never<00:04:02.189> happen<00:04:02.430> or<00:04:03.359> that

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
because that would never happen or that

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.050 
because that would never happen or that
it<00:04:03.720> wasn't<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.079> camera<00:04:04.590> because<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.909> would

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
it wasn't the camera because that would

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.610 
it wasn't the camera because that would
make<00:04:06.209> me<00:04:06.329> really<00:04:06.359> sad<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.259> just<00:04:07.470> got

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
make me really sad because I just got

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.550 
make me really sad because I just got
this<00:04:07.799> camera<00:04:08.159> and<00:04:08.340> I'm<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.790> happy<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.150> it

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
this camera and I'm really happy with it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.589 
this camera and I'm really happy with it
anyhow<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.859> if<00:04:11.129> you<00:04:11.370> are<00:04:11.519> ever<00:04:11.729> shooting<00:04:12.419> in<00:04:12.509> a

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
anyhow so if you are ever shooting in a

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.379 
anyhow so if you are ever shooting in a
situation<00:04:12.810> where<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.189> white<00:04:14.639> balance<00:04:14.970> is

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
situation where the white balance is

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.469 
situation where the white balance is
changing<00:04:16.139> between<00:04:16.320> shots<00:04:17.009> you<00:04:17.909> need<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.269> look

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
changing between shots you need to look

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.050 
changing between shots you need to look
up<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.959> find<00:04:18.989> out<00:04:19.739> what<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.609> light<00:04:20.789> source

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
up and find out what is the light source

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.960 
up and find out what is the light source
if<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.630> light<00:04:22.019> source<00:04:22.320> isn't<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:23.009> constant

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
if the light source isn't a constant

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.930 
if the light source isn't a constant
light<00:04:24.900> source<00:04:25.229> if<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.949> light<00:04:26.610> that

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
light source if it's a light that

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.560 
light source if it's a light that
flickers<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:27.779> has<00:04:28.169> different<00:04:28.560> frequencies

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
flickers that has different frequencies

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.530 
flickers that has different frequencies
