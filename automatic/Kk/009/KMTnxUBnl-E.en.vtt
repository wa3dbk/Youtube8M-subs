00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
unlocked very easy sometimes it gets

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.200

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
really difficult the wires just are very

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.600 
really difficult the wires just are very
confusing<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:32.900> don't<00:01:33.110> know<00:01:33.320> exactly<00:01:34.220> how

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
confusing and you don't know exactly how

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
to get to them we got here but typically

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.450 
to get to them we got here but typically
it<00:01:42.080> shouldn't<00:01:42.440> really<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.979> much<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.280> a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
it shouldn't really be that much of a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.420 
it shouldn't really be that much of a
