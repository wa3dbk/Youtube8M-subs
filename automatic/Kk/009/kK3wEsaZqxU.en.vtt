Hi, this is Miriam Schulman, and in this brief
teaser I am going to paint a watercolor on

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.620
canvas. This is not the full tutorial. If
you want the full tutorial, you can go to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.620
the Inspiration Place, which is at (NEW URL)
theinspirationplace.net, and you can sign

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.369
up for my online class, Autumnal Inspirations.
And, in that class, there's 8 different projects,

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.279
including this one, which I share my secrets
for painting watercolor on canvas. Plus, so

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.279
many other projects. Just enjoy this little,
fun teaser. Bye! 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.000
Now, this teaser is just a few minutes, but long... But, in 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.000
the actual class, you get in-depth, slow,
explanations with every single pigment color,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.329
every single name of the products used, and
techniques for mixing color, and it's very

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:03.890
inspiring... all in an interactive form, where
you get to ask me questions about and upload

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.150
your work for more advice. So, I hope to see
you in one of my classes.
