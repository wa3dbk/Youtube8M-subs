00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.410
BATTLING THOSE FLAMES.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.940
THEY NEARLY OVERRAN FIRE

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.180
CREWS IN EL DORADO COUNTY.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.750
WE HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF THE

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.320
KING FIRE, AND WE BEGIN WITH

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.580
MIKE LUERY, IN THE HILLS

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.020
OVERLOOKING THE FIRE.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900
WHAT IS THE LATEST?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.590
THIS WAS JUST OVER THE

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.500
BRIDGE.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.330
YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE FILLING

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.400
THE SKY, BUT A GREATER CONCERN,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.440
LOOK OVER HERE, AT THESE BIG

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.710
PLUMES OF SMOKE FILLING THE SKY.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.670
WE HAVE SEEN HELICOPTERS, AND

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.580
NOW YOU CAN SEE PLANES DROPPING

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.420
RETARDANT, AND YOU CAN SEE SOME

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.580
OF THAT RETARDANT COMING DOWN

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.720
NOW.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.650
IT IS SPREADING SMOKE AND FLAMES

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.660
TO THE HILLS AND CANYONS BELOW,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.360
AND FOR AT LEAST ONE FIRE CREW

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.710
TODAY, A VERY SCARY MOMENT.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.000
IT

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.430
WAS A FULL AERIAL ASSAULT

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.500
TODAY AS CALFIRE

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.540
PLANES DROPPED

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.170
FIRE RETARDANT, WHILE

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.570
HELICOPTERS USED WATER TO BATTLE

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.810
THE PAIN FIRE, A

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.510
BLAZE THAT

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.940
FORCED CREWS TO USE A FIRE

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.580
SHELTER SHORTLY AFTERNOON TODAY.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.850
THOSE FIREFIGHTERS

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.520
ARE ALL SAFE

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.790
AND ACCOUNTED FOR, BUT THE

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.350
AFTERNOON WIND SENT THE FLAMES

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.690
FURTHER AND SENT SMOKE MILES

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.100
INTO THE AIR.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.760
WE JUST WANTED PEOPLE TO STAY

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.700
OUT OF THEM RIGHT NOW.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.860
ALL OF THE RESIDENTS

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.030
IN THIS

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.700
AREA HAVE BEEN FORCED TO

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.900
EVACUATE, AND YOU CAN SEE WHY.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.810
THIS FIRE IS STILL VERY HOT,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.140
VERY ACTIVE, AND VERY DANGEROUS,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.710
AND THE CONCERN IS THAT IT WILL

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.040
SPREAD ACROSS THE ROAD AND THEN

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.440
GO UP THE CANYON TO WHERE MORE

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.920
HOMES ARE LOCATED.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.050
MANY RESIDENTS HERE DID A

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.180
GOOD

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.750
JOB CREATING DEFENSIBLE SPACE,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.850
CLEARING BRUSH, TIMBER, AND

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.160
FLAMMABLES

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.620
AWAY FROM THE HOMES.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.330
REMOVING THE FUEL.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.130
IT BREAKS THE CONTINUITY OF

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.430
THE FUELS

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.930
AND PROVIDES A

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.870
DEFENSIBLE ENVIRONMENT.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.310
AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT LIVE

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.910
PICTURES NOW OF THIS KING FIRE.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.240
THE CAUSE OF IT IS STILL UNDER

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.040
INVESTIGATION.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.310
HOW FIRE IS TRYING

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.380
TO FIGURE OUT

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.910
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.380
CREWS, AND WE DO KNOW THAT THEY

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.880
ARE INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.320
BY THE WAY, YOU SAW THE

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.020
HELICOPTERS EARLIER.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.370
WE ARE GOING TO SHOW
