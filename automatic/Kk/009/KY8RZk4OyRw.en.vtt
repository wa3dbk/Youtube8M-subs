00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
thickening volumizing plumping one such

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
thickening volumizing plumping one such
as<00:01:57.829> them<00:01:58.130> falsies<00:01:58.999> by<00:01:59.239> Maybelline<00:01:59.899> or<00:02:00.639> the

plush one by Maybelline or the YSL one
that<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.329> love<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.899> don't<00:02:06.169> remember<00:02:06.289> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
that I love that I don't remember the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.680 
that I love that I don't remember the
name<00:02:06.739> right<00:02:06.979> now<00:02:07.159> oh<00:02:07.459> my<00:02:07.609> god<00:02:07.729> fo<00:02:07.999> seals<00:02:08.390> I

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
name right now oh my god fo seals I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.959 
name right now oh my god fo seals I
think<00:02:08.899> I'm<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.979> it's<00:02:10.130> not<00:02:10.250> any<00:02:10.459> of<00:02:10.550> those<00:02:10.640> are

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:10.969 
think I'm so it's not any of those are

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.459 
think I'm so it's not any of those are
like<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.120> Dior<00:02:11.510> show<00:02:11.599> or<00:02:12.049> any<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.319> those

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:12.469 
like the Dior show or any of those

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.620 
like the Dior show or any of those
definitely<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.519> separating<00:02:14.299> and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
definitely like a separating and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.510 
definitely like a separating and
thinning<00:02:15.080> one<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.070> does<00:02:16.220> give<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.460> a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
thinning one so it does give you a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.070 
thinning one so it does give you a
totally<00:02:16.970> different<00:02:17.330> look<00:02:17.480> I'm<00:02:17.750> sorry<00:02:17.930> I'm

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
totally different look I'm sorry I'm

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.660 
totally different look I'm sorry I'm
like<00:02:18.230> swinging<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.100> my<00:02:19.190> chair<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:19.640> I

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
like swinging here in my chair but I

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.520 
like swinging here in my chair but I
really<00:02:20.060> really<00:02:20.330> like<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.570> actually<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.410> was

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
really really like it actually it was

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.380 
really really like it actually it was
really<00:02:21.770> surprising<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.730> one<00:02:22.940> thing<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.240> I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
really surprising the one thing that I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.480 
really surprising the one thing that I
didn't<00:02:23.870> love<00:02:24.320> about<00:02:24.710> it<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> doesn't

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
didn't love about it is it doesn't

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.930 
didn't love about it is it doesn't
really<00:02:25.640> hold<00:02:25.970> your<00:02:26.330> curl<00:02:26.600> very<00:02:27.050> well<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:28.460> if<00:02:28.610> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
really hold your curl very well so if a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.760 
really hold your curl very well so if a
curl<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> big<00:02:29.840> thing<00:02:30.020> for<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:30.650> me

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
curl is a big thing for you and for me

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.070 
curl is a big thing for you and for me
it<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:32.030> doesn't<00:02:32.270> really<00:02:32.390> hold<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.720> curl<00:02:32.930> so

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it is it doesn't really hold the curl so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.600 
it is it doesn't really hold the curl so
much<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:33.800> right<00:02:34.070> away<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.280> could<00:02:34.490> already

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
much I like right away I could already

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.560 
much I like right away I could already
see<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:36.560> um<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:37.490> does<00:02:37.730> last<00:02:37.940> all<00:02:38.180> day<00:02:38.210> it

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
see it but um it does last all day it

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.440 
see it but um it does last all day it
doesn't<00:02:38.900> flake<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.350> doesn't<00:02:39.680> smudge<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:41.240> when

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
doesn't flake it doesn't smudge and when

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.930 
doesn't flake it doesn't smudge and when
applying<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:43.160> can<00:02:43.430> get<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.580> little

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
applying it it it can get a little

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.610 
applying it it it can get a little
clumpy<00:02:44.600> but<00:02:44.840> then<00:02:44.960> if<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.320> kind<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.500> go

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
clumpy but then if you just kind of go

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.080 
clumpy but then if you just kind of go
through<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.980> again<00:02:46.070> like<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.520> can<00:02:46.700> work<00:02:46.940> out

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
through it again like you can work out

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.560 
through it again like you can work out
those<00:02:47.330> clumps<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.580> yeah<00:02:49.580> really<00:02:50.240> liked<00:02:50.540> it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
those clumps so yeah really liked it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.410 
those clumps so yeah really liked it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
I don't know if I would repurchase it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.420 
I don't know if I would repurchase it
which<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.900> guess<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.290> final<00:03:15.890> bottom<00:03:16.070> line

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
which I guess is the final bottom line

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.580 
which I guess is the final bottom line
test<00:03:16.880> if<00:03:17.300> this<00:03:17.600> was<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> full<00:03:17.990> price<00:03:18.170> mascara

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
test if this was a full price mascara

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.490 
test if this was a full price mascara
pie<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.310> wouldn't<00:03:19.610> repurchase<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.810> was<00:03:20.990> if<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
pie I wouldn't repurchase it it was if I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.750 
pie I wouldn't repurchase it it was if I
saw<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.710> again<00:03:21.800> for<00:03:22.070> like<00:03:22.130> three<00:03:22.370> dollars<00:03:22.610> i

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
saw it again for like three dollars i

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.100 
saw it again for like three dollars i
probably<00:03:23.000> would<00:03:23.390> again<00:03:23.630> but<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:25.730> good<00:03:26.210> but<00:03:27.050> i

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
probably would again but it's good but i

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.200 
probably would again but it's good but i
guess<00:03:27.350> it's<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.770> i'm<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.190> traditional<00:03:28.910> kind

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
guess it's like i'm a traditional kind

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.030 
guess it's like i'm a traditional kind
of<00:03:29.390> girl<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.170> like<00:03:30.350> my<00:03:30.380> traditional

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
of girl and like I like my traditional
