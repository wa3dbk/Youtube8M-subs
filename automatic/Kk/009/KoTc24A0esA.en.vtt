know it's a weird thing to say but just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.429 
know it's a weird thing to say but just
to<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.119> him<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.329> screen<00:01:00.539> might<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.260> like

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
action it wasn't as bad as I thought

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.910 
action it wasn't as bad as I thought
it'd<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.690> there<00:01:15.929> also<00:01:16.229> hints<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.649> Joker

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

kryptonite<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.539> of<00:01:27.600> tired<00:01:27.780> of

kryptonite<00:01:28.289> but<00:01:28.409> hopefully<00:01:28.709> this<00:01:28.860> movie<00:01:29.159> will

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
kryptonite but hopefully this movie will

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.559 
kryptonite but hopefully this movie will
put<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.399> different<00:01:29.549> spin<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.179> get<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.420> see
