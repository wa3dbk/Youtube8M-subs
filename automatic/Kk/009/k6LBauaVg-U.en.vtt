00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.490

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 Mexican my brother has played here and 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.820
 I have many friends we had to play 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 here they play here and well I decided 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.440
 to come 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.250
 for guys photos look bad or talk 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.099
 the president and after talking to him 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.080
 and I felt very comfortable and because I think that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.760
 we can do something big 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.890
 that he falls in love with the Mexican league 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.810
 because coming to Mexico what are the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 illusions that ronaldinho has and that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.370
 You know about this Mexican league 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.910
 I know practically everything in the league 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.120
 Mexican and well I need to win something and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.260
 mexico then come here for this and 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.589
 I will fight to help my team 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.589
 conquer the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.200
 ronaldinho nobody doubts the quality of 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 football that you have been without a doubt 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.810
 a boom in this Mexican soccer but 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.600
 What do you think about it? 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.910
 you think the Mexican soccer fields 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.350
 They already talk a lot about that taste for 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.740
 party for the night outings that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.470
 you have definitely the team is 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.900
 thought for big things is a campus 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.940
 that for some reason they are followed 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.670
 associating with decent descent themes 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.250
 but although the percentage table we are 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.860
 located very well we are in the tenth 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.690
 place we have no problems and this team 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.369
 now with the support of the group image 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.250
 with the support of the graduate olegario goes 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.500
 to leave is a very solid project is a 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.610
 long- term project we are giving 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.770
 signs of that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.410
 why hiring ronaldinho 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.420
 that is a world champion a player of 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.310
 elite and that's why we're doing 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 initiatives like taking to the selection 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 on October 12 we are finally 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.750
 giving signals to our fans in the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.660
 recognition for the support they have given us 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.070
 given even in difficult stages with 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.990
 past administrations 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.729
 and the message of this group is that which is 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.320
 a solid team that is well 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.270
 conformed that there is a long project 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.250
 term and that we are to stay in 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.920
 creta with which to always live from the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.130
 same way and all that equipment that happens 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.860
 come out champion then I hope to continue 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.150
 doing the same thing here living from the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.450
 same way and conquering titles 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.950
 It looks good arrival at your arrival at 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.480
 team not to the querétaro speaks very well 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 of these however there are also 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.010
 detractors there are those who say that you arrive 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.810
 to Mexican soccer because it did not stay for you 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.209
 another because the periods of 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.720
 hiring in other leagues what do you think 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.799
 you of these of this thought and if you go 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.799
 to play tomorrow 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.290
 from today 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.650
 I have had possibilities of teams of 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.690
 house all part of the world and as I have 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.420
 explained earlier by the conversation that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.800
 my brother has had with the president 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.550
 group coast 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.020
 he conquered me and well he wanted to 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:25.360
 to live here because I'm coming to 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.360
 to continue my story and better 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.920
 you've won everything at the club level and already 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.260
 you had expressed it but if it is 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.910
 to define your current status as new 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.540
 player of roosters of the querétaro like the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.540
 you would define 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.670
 I would define myself as young with a lot 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.770
 ambition as you were starting a 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.520
 more time 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.400
 so 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.640
 with great enthusiasm as always to get to 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.070
 Clubs happens and how open sooner if 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.240
 I want to come here and make history in a 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.310
 club and I'm very motivated thank you 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.030
 level has nowadays the league of mexico 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.030
 worldwide 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.570
 but they found very high level because 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.420
 from here players have left for the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.360
 world with great level has not been 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.230
 compared already I know that it is beginning 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.620
 it's still this season but everything already 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.110
 they speak that the teams are very well 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.620
 then I think I 'm going to find a 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.370
 strong league and that has everything to grow 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.050
 a lot in the next few years titles and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.830
 also show that can tell us 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.500
 about 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.330
 my goal is this 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.020
 keep my in the game 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.629

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.720
 or dedicate myself to help the 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:56.120
 mates do what I want this and 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.300
 I'm going to dedicate myself to this 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.689
 to give my best to help plead the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.269
 name of the club as high as possible 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.819
 today you are physically whole for 

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:10.719
 dispute some minutes you will ask 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.719
 the coach play 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.680
 this one that can explain the president of 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.920
 creators if I'm talking now but 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.010
 I'm fine physically but today I should not 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.550
 play not yet because I'm going on a trip 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.040
 but I think I bring you some days already 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.130
 I can be part of the group and if the 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.400
 coach will decide it can happen to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.750
 play then then one more question for 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.880
 here the last one of him just one 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.340
 note on this and ronaldinho is going to 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.620
 be in the in the half time of 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.260

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.140

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.420
 presentation to all the fans today in the 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.760
 today at halftime in the city of 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.380
 querétaro then he will be present in 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.430
 the game does not play but is present 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.440

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.880
 marquez

 in that sense you can talk to him 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.870
 here I believe that 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.760

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.120

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.090
