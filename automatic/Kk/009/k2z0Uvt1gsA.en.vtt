00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
it wouldn't be banana bread without
bananas<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.469> we<00:01:25.530> need<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.740> take<00:01:25.859> our<00:01:25.979> bananas

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

within a baking tray tin bowl sort of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
within a baking tray tin bowl sort of
glass<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:38.429> like<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.789> like<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.569> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
glass thing like this like this is a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
glass thing like this like this is a
perfect<00:01:40.140> thing<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.350> baking<00:01:40.859> banana<00:01:41.130> bread<00:01:41.399> I

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
perfect thing for baking banana bread I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.620 
perfect thing for baking banana bread I
think<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> only<00:01:42.209> thing<00:01:42.359> we<00:01:42.479> have

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
think this is the only thing we have

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.410 
think this is the only thing we have
that<00:01:42.840> could<00:01:42.959> probably<00:01:43.170> baked<00:01:43.439> banana<00:01:43.709> bread

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
that could probably baked banana bread

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.580 
that could probably baked banana bread
once<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.569> eventually<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.079> our<00:01:46.200> banana<00:01:46.470> bread

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
once we eventually have our banana bread

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
once we eventually have our banana bread
mixture<00:01:47.069> laid<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.489> in<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> nice<00:01:47.819> baking<00:01:48.420> tin

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mixture laid out in a nice baking tin

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.699 
mixture laid out in a nice baking tin
we're<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.289> to<00:01:49.319> put<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
we're going to want to put it in the

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.429 
we're going to want to put it in the
oven<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:50.009> 180<00:01:50.579> degrees<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.209> 30<00:01:51.720> minutes
