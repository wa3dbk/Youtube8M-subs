00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.640 
noticed that so here's the back of the
cake<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:17.460> if<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> cake<00:03:17.880> wasn't<00:03:18.300> carved<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
cake so if the cake wasn't carved it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.920 
cake so if the cake wasn't carved it
would<00:03:19.860> have<00:03:19.950> probably<00:03:20.130> fit<00:03:20.550> better<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.660> 10

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
would have probably fit better the 10

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.950 
would have probably fit better the 10
inch<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.440> top<00:03:22.650> but<00:03:23.580> since<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.330> threw<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
inch on top but since it is it threw it

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:36.290 
inch on top but since it is it threw it
off<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.140> little<00:03:25.470> bit

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.520 

so<00:03:36.930> that's<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.920> cake<00:03:38.130> guys<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:41.450> think<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:43.140> top

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
so that's the cake guys I think the top

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.810 
so that's the cake guys I think the top
for<00:03:44.070> some<00:03:44.250> reason<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:46.160> looks<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.490> little

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
for some reason that just looks a little

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.900 
for some reason that just looks a little
off<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.450> don't<00:03:48.510> know<00:03:49.160> I'm<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.310> too<00:03:50.520> happy<00:03:50.640> with
