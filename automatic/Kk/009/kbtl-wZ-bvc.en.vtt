00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hi, girls can do a review for 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.010
 you of a rebuilding product is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.710
 I usually use more products 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.619
 moisturizer than builders but the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.449
 people need to occasionally use 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 than risk reconstruction mainly 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.670
 Who does hair chemistry and how do I do it? 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.869
 I made light I'm always doing a touch up 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 of lights 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.119
 Every week I brush two 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.679
 times a week then it is important to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.200
 people are always using one by one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.690
 product that will rebuild by mass 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 duboc capillary that these 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 procedures make us lose and we 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 There are 15 days that arrived for me and until 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 I 'll show you there on the blog that I 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.030
 I ordered and a month later normally 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 my completed movie that arrives in 30 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.110
 days 20 to 30 days 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.579
 so this product came to me here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.379
 dattij I will not know the name of the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.799
 line bed network but it's the antidote bread 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.689
 This is the step I step 3 not this one. 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.740
 hence it is level 3 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.560
 this line vanish line is divided 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 in three products is number one for 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.930
 hair that has almost no damage 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 number two for hairs have damage 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.420
 intermediate and this here is called 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.729
 of resurrection breaks that hair that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 already in the uti is already almost dying 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.720
 even and I was soon more powerful because 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.030
 While I talked to you there on the blog 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.420
 I like strong emotions 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 I bought soon the number 3 had not 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 need I could buy a number 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 2 but I wanted to tell you soon number and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.210
 it is a conditioner to always achieve 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.220
 does it's the producers again and just like that? 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 are conditioners that you can also 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.930
 use as a moisturizing mask 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 depending only on the time you go 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.110
 to act in the end, something that I 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.010
 I noticed that I think 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.710
 very strange is that I tried to read all 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.960
 the letters here behind and do not speak 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.930
 How long to leave in the hair 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.210
 so I had to look on the internet and then 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.610
 I was talking that you could pass 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.070
 to take without leaving osaka to use as 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.710
 conditioner or could also leave 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.260
 five minutes you are using there 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.600
 as a normal moisturizer 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.550
 products in very rich tutor resources 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.920
 titor is not good to leave a lot of time in 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.770
 hair that starts to get hard 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.140
 tyson indicates to you that you use produce 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.660
 It's true, my hair is all 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.670
 hard just asked for it finding it very 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.810
 time normally at most 10 minutes 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.180
 so good 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.940
 This one is five minutes only and it was 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.790
 which I used and 65 minutes lahm in two 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.580
 times with shampoo to take the excess of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.360
 moisture with the towel and there I applied 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.640
 a good amount of it in hair everything is 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.030
 let him act for five minutes at 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.610
 his consistency is like that and he looks 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.690
 a white crust with consistency of 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.750
 conditional good very fragrant like 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.470
 all products reaches it is also 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.330
 very very fragrant I'm in love 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.330
 by the smell of light products 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.610
 the shot would look like this does not know 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.140
 but at the same time a little more citric 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.290
 with red fruits without much study 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.269
 but then so he is super decimate stocks 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.430
 you pass on your hair will become a 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.590
 week in the nest and you can already 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.090
 to pass a finger on the power to untangle 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.060
 Because I like it under the shower. 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.239
 even embarrassed sandro and mail cin and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.320
 massaging my hair and then I 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.060
 I learn with a broach and 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.390
 while I'm afraid to take a shower or 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.579
 To put it together in my hair I make a 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:08.360
 hydration so it is enough 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.910
 emollient 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.310
 water the hair so it seems to me that it changes 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.860
 texture and daughter so thin and 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.799
 Soft long ago that you pass that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.269
 it ended up in heat but a very same 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.590
 hair type of baby 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.540
 I really liked this part and I went and 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.960
 I sharlei and passed a thermal protector 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.580
 make a brush and iv show the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.510
 result for you 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.290
 He left his hair very early. 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.990
 new you talking to you to realize 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.200
 my hair is with a silkiness gives a 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.780
 brightness is now night and 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.180
 surely you should see my hair one 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.020
 little darker here because the delivery that 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.900
 it was dark but it leaves the hair 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.630
 many and 12 with soft luster like me 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.930
 I'm fine, I like the product that 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.440
 let the hair, yes, take it with balance and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.230
 It was very cool even I liked it 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.050
 despite being a reconstructor, he did not 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.880
 hard hair and I do not think it was 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.600
 that I told you, you can not leave 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.460
 for a long time otherwise the 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.380
 hair stay the same 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.000
 but in this case I left the time 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.030
 right did not stay 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.700
 You see here, the image does not 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.020
 Let the hair lie, it 's really cool. 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.030
 very cool and I felt the hair is and if 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.430
 reconstruction is already the second 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.140
 time I'm using it and I felt the 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.919
 hair a little stronger I am 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.040
 feeling slightly stronger wire is 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.220
 it's not a super mask 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.200
 type to be low and low 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.600
 remains my favorite as 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.360
 reconstructive mask but it is a 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.850
 great for you to wear on the day 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.210
 day as a father conditioner treating his 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.880
 family and make a wonderful product 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.520
 Smelly beautiful, I thought it was worth it. 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.550
 Worthwhile, I did not regret it. 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.160
 the price of it if I do not mistake a whole 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.620
 it was a headache now but I think 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.040
 It's 22 dollars, I'll leave the link to 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.340
 you 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.670
 here below it comes with 200 ml will give 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.200
 for you to walk in that more 20 times 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.440
 it yields quite heavy and cement 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.900
 he yields a lot because they 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.930
 failure right in the hair is a product I 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.180
 I liked one more product approved until today 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.670
 I have not used any products that I 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.580
 I did not like the brand very much 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.420
 mainly from the smell of products and 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.240
 of today 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.730
 I think that's how marie fortnight is 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.020

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.360
 I know of no brand that has 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.250
 fragrance better than it does if you 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.590
 never tried it's worth you 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.710
 choose a product from them and have a home 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.180
 because of the smell is very good and 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.470
 in the hair who can not be with the 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.300
 hair smell is not 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.730

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.990
