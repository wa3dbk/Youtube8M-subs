00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
and I think the other thing that might

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.850 
and I think the other thing that might
have<00:04:13.510> factored<00:04:13.900> into<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.260> call<00:04:14.500> wing<00:04:14.710> was

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
have factored into that call wing was

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.620 
have factored into that call wing was
not<00:04:15.640> only<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.000> was<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> little<00:04:16.360> bit<00:04:16.510> of

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
not only that was a little bit of

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.960 
not only that was a little bit of
contact<00:04:17.049> from<00:04:17.350> tape<00:04:17.620> in<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.160> mirkovic<00:04:18.489> with

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
that contact force mirkovic maybe to

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.620 
that contact force mirkovic maybe to
have<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.220> contact<00:04:21.730> with<00:04:22.000> gayton<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:22.480> that

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
have that contact with gayton so that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.060 
have that contact with gayton so that
might<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.870> been<00:04:22.900> another<00:04:23.200> thing<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.950> the
