00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.040 
and at the very end there's like a small
interview<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.970> he'd<00:03:32.210> be<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.720> he<00:03:32.840> did<00:03:33.020> with

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
in this precise time period this is like

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.660 
in this precise time period this is like
a<00:04:19.610> good<00:04:20.600> amount<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:21.110> medicine<00:04:21.590> for<00:04:21.770> her<00:04:21.950> good

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
a good amount of medicine for her good

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.610 
a good amount of medicine for her good
news<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.180> kind<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.420> keep<00:04:23.600> her<00:04:23.660> going<00:04:24.080> into<00:04:24.320> the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
news to kind of keep her going into the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.550 
news to kind of keep her going into the
into<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> winter<00:04:25.660> months<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.050> we'll<00:04:27.380> go<00:04:27.530> from

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
into the winter months and we'll go from

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.930 
into the winter months and we'll go from
there<00:04:27.770> I<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:28.910> Ravens<00:04:30.250> really<00:04:31.250> kind<00:04:31.820> of

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
there I think Ravens really kind of

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.910 
there I think Ravens really kind of
mirror<00:04:32.450> what<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.080> city<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.440> about<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.890> I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
mirror what the city is about and I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.200 
mirror what the city is about and I
don't<00:04:34.070> think<00:04:34.220> that's<00:04:34.280> always<00:04:34.610> true<00:04:34.790> for<00:04:35.180> a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
don't think that's always true for a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.920 
don't think that's always true for a
sports<00:04:35.570> team<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.020> know<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.170> think<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.590> know

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
sports team you know I think you know

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.540 
sports team you know I think you know
you<00:04:38.930> know<00:04:39.020> we're<00:04:39.200> not<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.590> glitz<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.280> glam<00:04:40.520> of

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
you know we're not the glitz and glam of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.690 
you know we're not the glitz and glam of
New<00:04:40.940> York<00:04:41.240> or<00:04:41.540> Philadelphia<00:04:41.810> or<00:04:42.440> DC<00:04:43.100> or<00:04:43.250> some

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
New York or Philadelphia or DC or some

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.220 
New York or Philadelphia or DC or some
of<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.880> bigger<00:04:44.240> markets<00:04:44.690> around<00:04:44.780> we're<00:04:45.050> just

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
of the bigger markets around we're just

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.080 
of the bigger markets around we're just
kind<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.710> little<00:04:45.830> Baltimore<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.880> think

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
kind of a little Baltimore and I think

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.550 
kind of a little Baltimore and I think
there's<00:04:47.210> like<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.390> certain<00:04:47.750> pride<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.260> people

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
there's like a certain pride that people

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.140 
there's like a certain pride that people
taking<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:48.950> being<00:04:49.190> like<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.640> real

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
taking that being like a real

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.210 
taking that being like a real
blue-collar<00:04:50.690> town<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.530> certainly<00:04:52.100> a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
blue-collar town and certainly a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.100 
blue-collar town and certainly a
blue-collar<00:04:52.640> team<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.660> think<00:04:53.780> when<00:04:54.080> people

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
blue-collar team so I think when people

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.200 
blue-collar team so I think when people
watch<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.590> ravens<00:04:55.010> perform<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:55.790> they're<00:04:55.970> kind

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
watch the ravens perform it they're kind

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.960 
watch the ravens perform it they're kind
of<00:04:56.330> vicariously<00:04:56.930> live<00:04:57.170> in<00:04:57.320> from<00:04:57.530> them<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:58.790> the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
of vicariously live in from them in the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.900 
of vicariously live in from them in the
NFL<00:04:59.540> if<00:04:59.930> we<00:05:00.110> go<00:05:00.230> through<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.920> games<00:05:01.760> that

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
NFL if we go through the the games that

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.190 
NFL if we go through the the games that
the<00:05:02.090> Ravens<00:05:02.360> have<00:05:02.480> played<00:05:02.690> over<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:02.960> years

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
the Ravens have played over the years

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.990 
the Ravens have played over the years
you<00:05:03.380> can<00:05:03.530> probably<00:05:03.710> count<00:05:04.100> on<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:04.460> hand<00:05:04.640> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
you can probably count on one hand the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.420 
you can probably count on one hand the
amount<00:05:05.300> of<00:05:05.390> blowout<00:05:06.350> loss<00:05:06.680> since<00:05:06.980> they've<00:05:07.160> had

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
amount of blowout loss since they've had

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.370 
amount of blowout loss since they've had
because<00:05:07.760> they<00:05:07.910> always<00:05:08.090> fight<00:05:08.510> you<00:05:09.080> know<00:05:09.200> no

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
because they always fight you know no

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.040 
because they always fight you know no
matter<00:05:09.410> how<00:05:10.300> much<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.510> odds<00:05:11.660> are<00:05:11.870> stacked

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
matter how much the odds are stacked

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.650 
matter how much the odds are stacked
against<00:05:12.440> them<00:05:12.590> they<00:05:12.710> always<00:05:12.830> find<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.250> way<00:05:13.660> to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
against them they always find a way to
