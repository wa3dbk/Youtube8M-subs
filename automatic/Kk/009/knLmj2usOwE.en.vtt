00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello everyone with you year wars and today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:18.619
 I'll show you a working cheat for black ops 2 and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.619
 warm version of the steam and so it means 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:36.350
 virus threat was detected however 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.350
 if we disable the virus 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.880
 and second 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.810
 us there will be something in the same turn on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.620
 and them warhawk 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:01.580
 Guest Guest did not understand what to do but 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.479
 I think he makes you invisible and you 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.940
 can go through some walls 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:13.580
 asleep he turns on the weapon speed 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.220
 recharge and running almost to the maximum 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.740
 well, except for running, running there is not very fast but 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.009
 actually works 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:30.320
 boils it add ammo for example 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:35.180
 zombie fashion years this immortality works 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.830
 for some reason, only in zombie fashion in 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.070
 This multiplayer does not work 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.070
 so all these functions even work 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:51.439
 the blue splash inappropriately prom was in big 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:55.340
 bull obs it doesn't work if we click 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:59.510
 on the button we will say there is something like that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.729
 he changes the features in a regular game and he 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.799
 actually says that there is this type I 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.500
 did but damn here it also works but 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.360
 when we turn on playing with us immediately to 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.959
 will check us throw out proper but not 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.780
 will throw out and will rewrite the file and they should 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.290
 include strictly when you play on 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.920
 well, for example, about five minutes because 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.370
 what may be the verification started and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.290
 include only when you already have 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.390
 checked for what you mean there honest 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.670
 a player could you have no complaints well 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.420
 you can only turn on after 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.210
 this and after five minutes of playing on the server 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.700
 also in a zombie in a blue player at all 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.060
 you can turn on anytime 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:04.610
 actually this is all we see rewrites 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:14.160
 the files I played personally by the file thief 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:18.690
 version 111 of the chechen act what is in 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:23.400
 in general, you can download it all from me 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:28.470
 this cheat add me just skype and i 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:34.250
 I can throw off well, that's all 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.250
