00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:09.359
 hyung pumps manufacture and repair of 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.359
 pumps since 1968 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.720
 the auto cervantes pumps of the series 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.670
 industrial solve effective and 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.539
 economically the transfer of the most 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.579
 wide range of fluids 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 the pumps that make up the series 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.599
 industrial jung have bodies 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 manufactured entirely in steel 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.660
 316l stainless or in brass being 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.680
 equipped with various types of engines 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.080
 electric 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 for its studied constructive design 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.780
 they only have one moving part without 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.530
 gears and non-contact metal metal 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.020
 property that decreases 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.220
 remarkably its wear and guarantee a 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.220
 continued service 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.449
 they do not need lubrication they are versatile 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.489
 and perfectly adaptable because the 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.250
 Pump body can rotate 360 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.289
 degrees which allows positioning the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.720
 mouths depending on the need 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.390
 installation the body of the pump is 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.210
 eccentric with respect to the turbine due 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.040
 to the fixed cam that has integrated 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.630
 due to this eccentricity the volume 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 that is created between the blades of the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 turbines change when turning is the pumps 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.050
 they are auto cervantes the priming is 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.909
 instantaneous 30 seconds can rotate in 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.429
 any angle and in both directions of 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.890
 rotation are appropriate pumps for 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.509
 volatile or viscous liquids are not 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.119
 Recommend for highly products 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.909
 abrasives due to the wear of the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.950
 slightly metallic solutions 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.350
 abrasive or gritty can be 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.630
 Taken normally 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.330
