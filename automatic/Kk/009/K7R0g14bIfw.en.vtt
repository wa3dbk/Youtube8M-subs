00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
a kind of an odd history about

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.810 
a kind of an odd history about
themselves<00:01:19.420> as<00:01:19.600> well<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:21.190> used<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.430> be<00:01:21.580> high

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
themselves as well that used to be high

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.880 
themselves as well that used to be high
elves<00:01:23.220> until<00:01:24.220> their<00:01:25.470> thumbnail<00:01:26.470> got

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
elves until their thumbnail got

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.030 
elves until their thumbnail got
destroyed<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:30.880> thought<00:01:31.210> she<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
destroyed and so I thought she is very

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.890 
destroyed and so I thought she is very
off<00:01:33.340> balanced<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.250> at<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.550> holder<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.810> know

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
off balanced so at the holder you know

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.310 
off balanced so at the holder you know
what<00:01:38.050> there's<00:01:38.380> some<00:01:38.680> well<00:01:38.920> which<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.610> their
