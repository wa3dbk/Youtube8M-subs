larger<00:01:18.689> punches<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.560> top<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> smaller

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
larger punches up on top and the smaller

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
larger punches up on top and the smaller
ones<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> bottom<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.460> actually<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
ones on the bottom but you actually just

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
ones on the bottom but you actually just
see<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> larger<00:01:24.659> ones<00:01:24.840> even<00:01:25.229> fit<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
see the larger ones even fit on the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
see the larger ones even fit on the

bottom so that'll give you plenty of
room<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.290> space<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> top<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.970> maybe

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
room to have space on the top for maybe

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.440 
room to have space on the top for maybe
some<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.810> older<00:01:34.470> style<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.189> punches<00:01:35.850> that
