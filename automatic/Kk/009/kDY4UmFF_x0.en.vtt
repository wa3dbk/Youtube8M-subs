00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
a really confused mess and that meant I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.810 
a really confused mess and that meant I
couldn't<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> sleep<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.739> ages<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.610> I'm

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
not sure if it was that oh if it was the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
not sure if it was that oh if it was the
positioning<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> bad<00:00:45.960> since<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.860> moved<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
positioning of the bad since we moved it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.970 
positioning of the bad since we moved it
I<00:00:47.789> don't<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.750> seemed<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.559> weird

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I don't know it just seemed really weird

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.150 
I don't know it just seemed really weird
and<00:00:50.370> odd<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.690> wasn't<00:00:52.230> used<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.890> way<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and odd and I wasn't used to the way the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.010 
and odd and I wasn't used to the way the
light<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.579> coming<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> room<00:00:54.239> compared<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
light was coming in the room compared to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.689 
light was coming in the room compared to
my<00:00:55.170> position<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
my position in and I don't know if that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760 
my position in and I don't know if that
kept<00:00:56.940> me<00:00:57.030> awake<00:00:57.270> or<00:00:57.539> whether<00:00:57.899> maybe<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> was

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
kept me awake or whether maybe it was

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
kept me awake or whether maybe it was
the<00:00:58.890> shine<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.820> that's<00:00:59.940> more

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the shine in there I think that's more

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
the shine in there I think that's more
likely<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.719> don't<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.530> some

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
likely I don't know need to have some

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
likely I don't know need to have some
breakfast<00:01:02.070> I've<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.609> Skype<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.030> my

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120

breakfast I've just got off Skype to my
dad<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.510> us<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.229> asked<00:01:04.470> him<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.610> he<00:01:05.610> thinks<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
dad on us and I asked him if he thinks I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.620 
dad on us and I asked him if he thinks I
can<00:01:06.990> make<00:01:07.200> pancakes<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.549> banana<00:01:08.850> instead

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can make pancakes with a banana instead

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.359 
can make pancakes with a banana instead
of<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.840> egg<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:10.710> said<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.250> only

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of an egg and he said well there's only

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
of an egg and he said well there's only
one<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> find<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.350> have

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
one way to find out because I don't have

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.600 
one way to find out because I don't have
any<00:01:13.590> eggs<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> make

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
any eggs but I really want to make

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
any eggs but I really want to make
pancakes<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.509> sure<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> could<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pancakes and I'm sure I could use a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.280 
pancakes and I'm sure I could use a
banana<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:17.009> mushed<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.509> egg<00:01:18.720> does

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
banana like mushed up as the egg does

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
banana like mushed up as the egg does
that<00:01:19.439> make<00:01:19.590> sense<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.520> banana

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that make sense so just like banana

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820 
that make sense so just like banana

I'll so I'm just gonna like go with the
flow<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.110> let's<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> looks

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
