00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.890
 greetings to the doctor the war that I love you very much 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.009
 for the student 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.889
 of the Japanese masaru emote a scientist 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.390
 which was to see that since I know him it seems to me that what he has 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.490
 discovered and it has a very big importance I want to share it with all 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.650
 you here black because it may have enough relevance 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.689
 Well this man is very interested in water molecules 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.559
 and what he did was to subject non-physical stimuli to mental stimuli 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.380
 stimuli of thought 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.690
 for water molecules and then the room did before and after these 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.620
 stimuli 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.610
 checking yourself 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.030
 that the molecules reacted in a positive way with positive stimuli 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.970
 and a negative way 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.040
 with negative stimuli in its own molecular composition 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.140
 this seems to me of vital importance 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.630
 since the human being is 80 or 90% water 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.120
 and how can these stimuli of thought affect 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.210
 our own water molecules is to say with our own 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.780
 body rupture 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.940
 but also 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 with the water molecules of the people that we have around 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.900
 and to whom the health before motorcycle discovered that these stimuli are external and that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.660
 also that one's own thinking can affect water molecules that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.820
 they are on the outside of our body stop third people 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.710
 these studies come to corroborate 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.049
 one of the videos that loaded that is the relationship between beliefs and 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.000
 results think big 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.009
 in which there were two effects the placebo effect and the pigmalion effect 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.800
 which the thought of the doctors and the ere and the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 teachers influenced the outcome of the students 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.850
 and the sick 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.020
 then it seems fundamental to me because our own thoughts 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 affect our own composition and of course our way of seeing the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.390
 world already said the pleasure is what you think quotes complements become what 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.130
 what do you think is 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 and also affects the reality of others because we can influence their 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.740
 composition of the water molecule 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.810
