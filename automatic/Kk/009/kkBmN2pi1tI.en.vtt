00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.980 
later down here in the inspector but I'm
going<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.530> go<00:01:39.710> ahead<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.009> keep<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.189> on<00:01:40.280> 4<00:01:40.520> by<00:01:40.640> 3

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
going to go ahead and keep it on 4 by 3

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.810 
going to go ahead and keep it on 4 by 3
now<00:01:41.990> if<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.259> shot<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.619> mini<00:01:42.890> DV<00:01:43.219> go<00:01:43.490> ahead<00:01:43.670> and

now if you shot on mini DV go ahead and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.230 
now if you shot on mini DV go ahead and
check<00:01:44.090> drop<00:01:44.659> frames<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.640> example<00:01:47.060> I

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
check drop frames and for this example I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.139 
check drop frames and for this example I
did<00:01:47.420> shoot<00:01:47.600> on<00:01:47.750> mini<00:01:47.990> DB<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.590> field<00:01:49.579> order<00:01:50.060> if

did shoot on mini DB and field order if

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.849 
did shoot on mini DB and field order if
you<00:01:50.210> don't<00:01:50.420> know<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:51.590> check

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
you don't know what this is just check

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.849 
you don't know what this is just check
Auto<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:52.909> not<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.149> big<00:01:53.390> deal<00:01:53.600> now<00:01:54.380> here's<00:01:54.649> the

important part of the Preferences that

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.779 
important part of the Preferences that
you<00:01:56.479> need<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.719> change<00:01:56.929> your<00:01:57.770> mode<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.549> needs

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
you need to change your mode this needs

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.749 
you need to change your mode this needs
to<00:01:58.880> be<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.060> two<00:01:59.390> pass<00:01:59.719> VBR<00:02:00.679> which<00:02:01.189> stands<00:02:01.490> for

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
to be a two pass VBR which stands for

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:02.590 
to be a two pass VBR which stands for
variable<00:02:02.090> bitrate

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
variable bitrate

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.859 
variable bitrate
it<00:02:02.780> process<00:02:03.469> your<00:02:03.590> video<00:02:03.859> twice<00:02:04.429> and<00:02:04.880> goes<00:02:05.600> to

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
it process your video twice and goes to

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.260 
it process your video twice and goes to
two<00:02:06.170> times<00:02:06.439> which<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:07.100> pass<00:02:07.310> verses<00:02:08.149> the

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
two times which is to pass verses the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.059 
two times which is to pass verses the
one<00:02:08.450> pass<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.289> two<00:02:09.380> passes<00:02:09.920> higher

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
one pass and so two passes higher

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.890 
one pass and so two passes higher
quality<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.150> does<00:02:11.300> take<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.569> little<00:02:11.690> bit

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
quality but it does take a little bit

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.930 
quality but it does take a little bit
more<00:02:12.080> time<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:12.380> if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.800> want<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.130> DVD<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.670> to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
more time so if you want a DVD and to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.400 
more time so if you want a DVD and to
produce<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.360> really<00:02:14.690> quick<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> you're<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.350> a

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
produce it really quick and you're on a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.710 
produce it really quick and you're on a
deadline<00:02:16.040> i<00:02:16.310> would<00:02:16.820> go<00:02:16.940> ahead<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.360> one

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
deadline i would go ahead and do one

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.150 
deadline i would go ahead and do one
pass<00:02:18.110> eventually

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
pass eventually

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.010 
pass eventually
you<00:02:19.190> want<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.460> make<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.820> DVD<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.780> pass

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
you want to make that DVD a to pass

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.050 
you want to make that DVD a to pass
because<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.470> better<00:02:21.650> quality<00:02:21.830> better<00:02:22.790> look

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
because it's better quality better look

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.780 
because it's better quality better look
so<00:02:23.780> go<00:02:23.990> ahead<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.230> select<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.740> bit<00:02:25.610> right

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
so go ahead and select that bit right

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.460 
so go ahead and select that bit right
now<00:02:25.940> here's<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.240> little<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> whole

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
now here's a little this is a whole

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
your client is working on an old DVD

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.970 
your client is working on an old DVD
laptop<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.750> think<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.650> gonna<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.950> a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
laptop and you think it's gonna have a

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.160 
laptop and you think it's gonna have a
hard<00:02:37.100> time<00:02:37.220> playing<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.640> fast<00:02:37.880> bitrate<00:02:38.510> video

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
hard time playing a fast bitrate video

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.380 
hard time playing a fast bitrate video
then<00:02:39.530> go<00:02:39.710> ahead<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:39.890> lower<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.430> quality<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
then go ahead and lower the quality the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.270 
then go ahead and lower the quality the
new<00:02:41.570> max<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.500> new<00:02:42.650> computers<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.220> are

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
new max and the new computers that are

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.800 
new max and the new computers that are
out<00:02:43.490> there<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.880> know<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.180> play<00:02:44.360> some<00:02:44.630> high

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
out there you know can play some high

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.590 
out there you know can play some high
bitrate<00:02:45.170> stuff<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.310> for<00:02:46.970> me<00:02:47.180> I'm<00:02:47.420> going<00:02:47.570> to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
bitrate stuff so for me I'm going to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.740 
bitrate stuff so for me I'm going to
burn<00:02:47.810> mine<00:02:48.050> on<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:49.070> higher<00:02:49.520> bitrate<00:02:49.940> we're

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
burn mine on a higher bitrate we're

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.110 
burn mine on a higher bitrate we're
usually<00:02:51.050> around<00:02:51.200> five<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:52.040> six<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.610> leave<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.060> on

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
usually around five to six I leave it on

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.100 
usually around five to six I leave it on
5.5<00:02:53.750> my<00:02:54.470> max<00:02:54.800> bitrate<00:02:55.130> I'll<00:02:55.520> leave<00:02:55.730> around<00:02:56.110> 6.5

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
5.5 my max bitrate I'll leave around 6.5

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.320 
5.5 my max bitrate I'll leave around 6.5
that's<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.560> greatest<00:02:57.800> I'll<00:02:58.100> go<00:02:58.280> because<00:02:59.180> it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
that's the greatest I'll go because it

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.970 
that's the greatest I'll go because it
hits<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.780> general<00:03:00.140> audience<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.680> people

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.170 
here but the video I'm burning today is
only<00:03:21.410> like<00:03:21.770> three<00:03:21.950> minutes<00:03:22.370> long<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.940> can

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
only like three minutes long so I can

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.480 
only like three minutes long so I can
keep<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.420> bitrate<00:03:23.750> really<00:03:24.140> high<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:25.280> max

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
keep the bitrate really high and the max

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.720 
keep the bitrate really high and the max
bitrate<00:03:25.760> around<00:03:26.320> 6.5<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:28.490> going<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.670> go

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
bitrate around 6.5 and I'm going to go

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.090 
bitrate around 6.5 and I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.300> go<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.870> next<00:03:30.170> option<00:03:30.830> here<00:03:31.010> in

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
got the newest Mac so I can do

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.720 
got the newest Mac so I can do
background<00:03:59.900> encoding<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.560> if<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.739> have<00:04:00.950> OS

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
background encoding and if you have OS

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.400 
background encoding and if you have OS
10<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.270> higher<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.720> can<00:04:02.870> be<00:04:03.050> able<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.230> do

10 and higher you can be able to do

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.350 
10 and higher you can be able to do
background<00:04:03.770> encoding<00:04:04.370> basically<00:04:05.090> what<00:04:05.239> it's

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
background encoding basically what it's

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.210 
background encoding basically what it's
going<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.540> do<00:04:05.690> is<00:04:05.870> while<00:04:06.470> you're<00:04:06.680> working<00:04:07.100> on

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
going to do is while you're working on

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.250 
going to do is while you're working on
the<00:04:07.370> DVD<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.120> setting<00:04:08.450> up<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.660> chapters<00:04:09.110> and

the DVD and setting up the chapters and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.350 
the DVD and setting up the chapters and
all<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.500> files<00:04:09.739> when<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.760> import<00:04:11.209> those

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
all the files when you import those

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360 
all the files when you import those
files<00:04:11.600> are<00:04:11.810> going<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.989> be<00:04:12.050> encoding<00:04:12.680> if<00:04:12.890> you

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
files are going to be encoding if you

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.040 
files are going to be encoding if you
have<00:04:13.580> it<00:04:13.730> on<00:04:13.880> background<00:04:14.270> encoding<00:04:14.930> which

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
have it on background encoding which

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.630 
have it on background encoding which
means<00:04:15.260> while<00:04:15.950> you're<00:04:16.130> working<00:04:16.250> in<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
means while you're working in the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.860 
means while you're working in the
background<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.180> videos<00:04:17.419> aren't<00:04:17.570> coding

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
background the videos aren't coding

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.349 
background the videos aren't coding
encode<00:04:18.770> on<00:04:18.919> build<00:04:19.190> means<00:04:19.549> once<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.030> select

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
encode on build means once you select

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.970 
encode on build means once you select
format<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:20.900> burn<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.350> DVD<00:04:21.470> it's<00:04:21.799> going<00:04:21.919> to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
format and burn the DVD it's going to

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.060 
format and burn the DVD it's going to
take<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.310> extra<00:04:22.669> time<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.300> encode<00:04:24.169> before

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
take that extra time and encode before

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.770 
take that extra time and encode before
it<00:04:25.160> burns<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.060> that's<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.330> lot<00:04:26.450> more<00:04:26.570> time

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
it burns so that's a lot more time

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.450 
it burns so that's a lot more time
you're<00:04:26.900> going<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.050> add<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.410> your<00:04:27.530> formatting

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
you're going to add to your formatting

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.760 
you're going to add to your formatting
time<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.150> do<00:04:29.300> background<00:04:29.720> encoding<00:04:30.350> but

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
time so I do background encoding but

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.110 
time so I do background encoding but
again<00:04:30.979> depends<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.460> your<00:04:31.580> computer<00:04:31.850> slow

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
again depends if your computer slow

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.950 
again depends if your computer slow
you're<00:04:32.750> going

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
you're going

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.840 
you're going
you<00:04:33.020> need<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.259> do<00:04:33.350> any<00:04:33.530> code<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.830> build<00:04:34.069> so<00:04:34.699> I'm

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
you need to do any code on build so I'm

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.460 
you need to do any code on build so I'm
going<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.060> apply<00:04:35.300> these<00:04:35.419> settings<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.139> say

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
going to apply these settings and say

means<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.840> audio<00:05:15.320> has<00:05:16.039> been<00:05:16.370> encoded<00:05:16.669> and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
means the audio has been encoded and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.120 
means the audio has been encoded and
when<00:05:17.599> this<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.930> finished<00:05:18.229> in<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.440> video<00:05:18.770> it'll

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
when this is finished in the video it'll

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.920 
when this is finished in the video it'll
have<00:05:19.250> a<00:05:19.280> green<00:05:19.550> dot<00:05:19.699> as<00:05:19.820> well<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.570> reason<00:05:20.900> that

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
have a green dot as well the reason that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.689 
have a green dot as well the reason that
separates<00:05:21.380> video<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.800> audio<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:22.370> that<00:05:22.550> if

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
separates video and audio is so that if

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.010 
separates video and audio is so that if
you<00:05:22.820> have<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:22.970> different<00:05:23.240> language<00:05:23.360> coming<00:05:23.870> in

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
you have a different language coming in

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.810 
you have a different language coming in
like<00:05:24.289> say<00:05:24.470> I'm<00:05:24.650> going<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.830> add<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.190> Japanese

like say I'm going to add a Japanese
language<00:05:26.449> and<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:27.020> subtitle<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:28.400> can<00:05:28.550> use<00:05:28.759> that

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
language and a subtitle you can use that

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.850
