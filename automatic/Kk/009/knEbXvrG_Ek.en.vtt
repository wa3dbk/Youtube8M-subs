this box I think this would be a fairly
quick<00:00:23.310> procedure<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.689> small

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
quick procedure this is a really small

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.890 
quick procedure this is a really small
box<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.670> hands<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.570> able

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
to connect both of the 3.5 and the USB

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.529 
to connect both of the 3.5 and the USB
cables<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:54.000> notebook<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
cables into your notebook of the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
cables into your notebook of the
computer<00:00:55.010> because<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
computer because that's from where you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.130 
computer because that's from where you
get<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.289> power<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> USB<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
get the power from from the USB but this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.470 
get the power from from the USB but this
doesn't<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> sound<00:01:02.699> card<00:01:03.059> built

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
doesn't actually have a sound card built

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.090 
doesn't actually have a sound card built
in<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.830> why<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> need<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> 3.5<00:01:07.100> speaker

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
in so that's why you need a 3.5 speaker

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.149 
in so that's why you need a 3.5 speaker
Jack<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> audio<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.320> premier

information<00:01:25.340> very<00:01:26.600> thick<00:01:27.600> piece<00:01:27.870> of<00:01:27.900> paper<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
information very thick piece of paper I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.180 
information very thick piece of paper I
guess<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> many<00:01:29.220> languages<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.890> here<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.040> have

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
guess in many languages and here we have

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.230 
guess in many languages and here we have
beaten<00:01:32.490> speakers<00:01:33.050> themselves

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
beaten speakers themselves

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.730 
beaten speakers themselves
there<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.330> nothing<00:01:36.690> more<00:01:36.810> inside<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> box
