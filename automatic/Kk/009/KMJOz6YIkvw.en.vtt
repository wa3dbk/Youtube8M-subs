00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello today we are going to learn to modify the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.630
 web boot system to be able 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.580
 format a computer with windows 8 e 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.640
 install the windows 7 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.449
 this is a computer a hewlett packard 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.449
 and off 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.700
 and start the computer again 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 and we press escape 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.520
 to start the system menu 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
 in this menu we give f9 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.880
 and we look 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.440
 that the web system and it does not let us 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.410
 gutierrez 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.360
 any normally 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.360
 we turn off the computer again 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.230
 we initiate it 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.730
 we sink escape again 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.890
 and with the f10 we go to lips 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 we go to configuration 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.900
 diving productions 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.890
 in the electric sector 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.110
 let's enable it 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.920
 we have to be aware 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.620
 of what unit or because the system is going 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.640
 to form that our computer already 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.580
 format already by means of a usb 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.850
 then I will leave the usb first in the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.270
 batting order if it were for the one divide 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.100
 and we can use the unit then 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.550
 we should place the internal unit 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.080
 of midi first 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:54.350
 in my case, the usb 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:58.270
 let's read f10 to save and restart 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.270
 again we press escape 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.270
 and we go back to the bios 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.679
 we have to be in this order so that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.790
 work or if it will not work 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.490
 we go back to configurations of 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.880
 boot 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.930
 and in league without support 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.970
 let's enable it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.180
 we give him yes 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.120
 again we press f10 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.530
 we save and restart and we give 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.530
 again escape 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.510
 already at that moment we press f9 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.600
 and we already see the units for a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.390
 Tender 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.940
 in my case it starts to boo from the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.490
 usb here appears because the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.490
 wifi system is disabled 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.780
 as you can see I can start to hit the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.110
 computer normally to be able 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.880
 install it windows 7 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.460
 well that's all if they have some 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.670
 inconvenient I'll be attentive to your 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.670
 questions 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.330
 thank you very much they are very well
