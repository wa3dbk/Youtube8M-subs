00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
written as twelve eight all that means

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.200 
written as twelve eight all that means
is<00:01:12.620> that<00:01:12.760> there<00:01:13.760> are<00:01:14.170> four<00:01:15.170> groups<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.650> three

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210

notes<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.390> every<00:01:17.630> bar<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.440> you<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.650> think<00:01:18.770> of

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
notes to every bar so you can think of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.530 
notes to every bar so you can think of
it<00:01:19.070> as<00:01:19.600> four<00:01:20.600> beats<00:01:21.020> if<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.799> four<00:01:22.540> blocks

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
it as four beats if you like four blocks

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.620 
it as four beats if you like four blocks
of<00:01:23.900> beats<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.470> each<00:01:25.400> block<00:01:25.820> or<00:01:25.970> beat<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.360> split

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
of beats and each block or beat is split

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.350 
of beats and each block or beat is split
into<00:01:26.840> three<00:01:26.960> more<00:01:27.440> notes<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.729> feel<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.270> in

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
into three more notes so you feel it in

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.730 
into three more notes so you feel it in
a<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.979> feed<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:31.370> threes<00:01:32.320> one<00:01:33.320> two<00:01:33.530> three

two three one two three and I've written
it<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> 12-8<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.070> we're<00:01:43.190> going<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.340> count<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.730> one

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
it a 12-8 so we're going to count it one

one<00:01:45.200> two<00:01:45.350> three<00:01:45.470> it's<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.710> little<00:01:45.860> bit<00:01:45.950> easier<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
one two three it's a little bit easier I

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.220 
one two three it's a little bit easier I
think<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:47.680> follow<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.390> like<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.630> say<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.870> feel

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
think to follow so like I say you feel

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.390 
think to follow so like I say you feel
it<00:01:51.380> in<00:01:51.470> groups<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:51.800> three

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
it in groups of three

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.790 
it in groups of three
hence<00:01:52.730> this<00:01:52.970> sort<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.180> sort<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.170> slinky<00:01:54.440> feel

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
hence this sort of sort of slinky feel

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800 
hence this sort of sort of slinky feel
to<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:55.370> two<00:01:55.610> three<00:01:55.640> one<00:01:56.210> two<00:01:56.240> three<00:01:56.480> one

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
to it one two three one two three one

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.990 
to it one two three one two three one
two<00:01:57.110> three<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:57.650> two<00:01:57.950> three<00:01:58.190> that's<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.700> tempo

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
two three one two three that's the tempo

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.510 
two three one two three that's the tempo
of<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.180> song<00:01:59.210> one<00:02:00.080> two<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:04.130> when<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.310> look<00:02:04.430> at

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
of the song one two so when you look at

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.990 
of the song one two so when you look at
the<00:02:04.580> music<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.090> see<00:02:05.300> four<00:02:05.630> groups<00:02:05.930> of<00:02:06.110> three

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
the music you see four groups of three

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.740 
the music you see four groups of three
and<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.420> can<00:02:08.539> think<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.840> each<00:02:08.929> block<00:02:09.259> as<00:02:09.500> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
and you can think of each block as a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.030 
and you can think of each block as a
like<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.230> wouldn't<00:02:12.440> call<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.709> beat<00:02:12.890> at<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
like you wouldn't call it a beat at the

let<00:05:10.050> me<00:05:10.110> try<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.410> second<00:05:10.830> half<00:05:10.979> of<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.130> bar

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
let me try the second half of the bar

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:25.040 
let me try the second half of the bar
slowly<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:23.150> now<00:05:24.150> when<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.720> speed<00:05:24.960> this

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
slowly for you now when you speed this

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.570 
slowly for you now when you speed this
up<00:05:25.199> you<00:05:25.320> might<00:05:25.470> find<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.830> based<00:05:26.130> on<00:05:26.250> quite

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
up you might find that based on quite

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.020 
up you might find that based on quite
difficult<00:05:26.849> to<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:28.500> play<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.949> at<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> fast<00:05:29.880> tempo

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
difficult to to play it at a fast tempo

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.520 
difficult to to play it at a fast tempo
you're<00:05:30.270> playing<00:05:30.449> two<00:05:30.599> notes<00:05:30.630> quite<00:05:31.080> close<00:05:31.349> to

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
you're playing two notes quite close to

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.430 
you're playing two notes quite close to
each<00:05:31.650> other<00:05:31.800> relatively<00:05:32.729> fast<00:05:33.139> so<00:05:34.139> you<00:05:34.199> can

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
each other relatively fast so you can

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.900 
each other relatively fast so you can
use<00:05:34.560> double<00:05:34.800> bass<00:05:34.979> drum<00:05:35.220> pedal<00:05:35.460> if<00:05:35.639> you<00:05:35.729> like

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
section so you could be using a double

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.610 
section so you could be using a double
bass<00:05:39.660> drum<00:05:39.840> pedal<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.199> have<00:05:40.380> one
