so<00:05:09.580> since<00:05:10.580> she<00:05:11.410> write<00:05:12.410> because<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:13.010> committed

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
so since she write because I committed

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.029 
so since she write because I committed
and<00:05:13.970> songs<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:15.169> write<00:05:15.320> in<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.620> first<00:05:15.830> place

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
and songs you write in the first place

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.310 
and songs you write in the first place
if<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.280> go<00:05:16.520> W<00:05:16.669> if<00:05:17.090> that<00:05:17.330> in<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.720> toughest<00:05:18.139> it

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
if you go W if that in the toughest it

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.690 
if you go W if that in the toughest it
is<00:05:18.500> s<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:19.400> s<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:23.000> is<00:05:23.180> same<00:05:23.479> as<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.960> circle<00:05:24.700> but

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
is s I s it is same as a circle but

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:34.290 
is s I s it is same as a circle but
bigger<00:05:26.240> and<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.050> will<00:05:27.229> take<00:05:27.410> extra<00:05:28.750> WR<00:05:29.750> s

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300
