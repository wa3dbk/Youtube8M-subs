they<00:02:25.870> scrape<00:02:26.170> off<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.470> remains<00:02:26.830> manually

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.850 

then<00:02:31.360> they<00:02:31.510> set<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> frames<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.500> another

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
then they set the frames on another

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.160 
then they set the frames on another
machine<00:02:33.040> called<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.880> honey<00:02:34.120> extractor<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
machine called a honey extractor it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.050 
machine called a honey extractor it
spins<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.860> honey<00:02:39.070> combs<00:02:39.340> until<00:02:39.700> all<00:02:39.880> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
spins the honey combs until all the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.900 
spins the honey combs until all the
honey<00:02:40.240> is<00:02:40.510> forced<00:02:40.900> out<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> cells

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
honey is forced out of the cells

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.130 
honey is forced out of the cells
afterwards<00:02:42.910> they<00:02:43.090> filter<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> honey<00:02:43.930> to

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
afterwards they filter the honey to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.930 
afterwards they filter the honey to
remove<00:02:44.470> any<00:02:44.680> pieces<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.160> wax<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:45.820> have

remove any pieces of wax that have

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.710 
remove any pieces of wax that have
slipped<00:02:46.210> through<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.610> honey<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.360> ready

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
slipped through then the honey is ready

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.030 
slipped through then the honey is ready
