00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.520
 nice girls that are starting business I 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.180
 I take my favorite tone base 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.889
 currently this l'oreal lumi match 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.230
 has such a little highlighting 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.610
 the effect does not give dullness full skin 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.040
 I also like at the moment on 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.449
 fall skin does not look so too 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.539
 dull and tired and on the contrary is 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:26.330
 translucent freshly rested and 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.640
 very very pretty I am all 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.470
 On our this all riches on face 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
 a brush that I like these three 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.890
 books spacex beach but if you donâ€™t have it 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.410
 it may well come and just clean 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.230
 I also apply the tonal fingers 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.260
 behind you in packs so it's quite quite 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.329
 ok and forgot to say something in tones 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.789
 particularly in general on the face can not see something that is not 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.460
 very very happy she really looks 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.480
 just like your beautiful well-groomed skin 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.489
 and so go brave to eyebrows without 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.129
 brows we will not go anywhere on any 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.440
 interviews especially with people like 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.330
 I have rare light so 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.700
 tint my favorite pencil 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.990
 so short strings for all 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.990
 view the collection naturally 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.440
 further using your new balm from 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.300
 dior lip glow which seems to me like 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.080
 just perfect for such a business 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.880
 makeup 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 it gives is not very good and moisturizing and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.100
 quite a bit of color and such are 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.810
 my new cream shadows are also from dior 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.880
 a new collection by the way Ravana Shout 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.050
 In my correction why use 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.660
 cream shadows because they are lighter 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.280
 applied and they look more 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.700
 naturally they look like this 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.220
 the blush shines here from the skin itself 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.530
 from the inside they don't look like just under 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.780
 something put on top of my skin 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.790
 it seems again to the daytime image there 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.190
 school for a job interview 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.090
 some business seems to me just like 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.090
 once perfect 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.480
 yes it's like a fresh look always 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.130
 They then use concealer 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.560
 Here at the moment I use 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 from clinic rbh who don't like under 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.050
 eyes and also here on the other parts of the face 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.600
 who want to highlight a little he 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.760
 will give even more freshness to the face due to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.360
 the fact that it will hide circles and darkening under 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.550
 eyes 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.050
 such traces of fatigue will hide red 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.360
 areas around the nose that are 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.160
 hormonal all women still what that 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.030
 whether it would be volumetric specks of you not faces 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.330
 and due to this leveling the whole weight 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.010
 washington and super-i cover and all 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.200
 powder from mac mineralize skinfinish 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.860
 why this particular powder because she 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.540
 does not give too haze I want my 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.750
 makeup all preserved such cetyl 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.680
 so translucent 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.150
 radiant base effect under the shadows from and in 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.940
 which I like at the moment and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.620
 all those will not use from mac this 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.880
 shadows for ever. we are so pink 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.920
 pink sandy were near heaps which 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.510
 I put on all mobile eyelids and a little bit 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.010
 in the inner circle to his little 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.770
 so too refresh and cause 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.600
 as you noticed all the makeup is not addressed 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.390
 on some vivid image 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.709
 but just so freshly rested 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.300
 neat and face anyway such 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.310
 so I was such an idea already see 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.459
 how is it going to be so mean 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.470
 medium brown is the perfect color for 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.350
 feathering it for use in 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.480
 folds which I think need any 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.450
 any girls in her beautician in her 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.280
 palettes under you see he is not at all 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.170
 noticeable in the eyes he just gives such 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.590
 natural fold and a little time 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:50.120
 helps you almost colors and further 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.550
 I will use this letter n from 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.269
 my favorite colors magician and to a little bit 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.780
 darken the outer corner and here too 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.580
 fold the fold of the century want this 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.430
 everything looked very natural since 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.300
 as if almost nothing on you 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.490
 There is no makeup 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.410
 and and now i will take so small 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.670
 bevel brush and same color 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.660
 I will use satin on the bottom on 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.299
 lower lash line 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.220
 very little pencil too and there is not 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.060
 I will use for the UN day 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.410
 but a little shadow on the not hurt and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.020
 now since I could not find my 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.590
 matte cream shades from mac in color 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.570
 vanilla here I use this from from 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.150
 another brand that lighten up a little 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.370
 I put a pencil under my eyebrow, but notice 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.590
 not on top of the lash line is that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.930
 it will be very noticeable will look 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.250
 in the evening and make the name to it like 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.200
 if you're interested in making a video 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.150
 separately about it like we fill 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.890
 the space between the cilia she 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.640
 looks very natural very 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.590
 day and finish this whole image 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.180
 mascaras of course I chose a mascara which 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.850
 at the moment i like for 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.010
 day makeup she shares 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.330
 slightly lengthens the cilia does not give 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.280
 some kind of extreme volume 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.910
 no such effect overhead 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.990
 eyelashes 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.950
 just relevant on the day to work and 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.840
 so on and now you will see something 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.640
 we got here you see me 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.470
 really like how the skin itself shines 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.410
 see this here is the effect tonal basis 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.130
 cream shadows and so on I'm even 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.110
 powdered but she doesn't look dull and 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.240
 here it is a little closer see the eyes 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.950
 lips and so on hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.950
 see you soon bye
