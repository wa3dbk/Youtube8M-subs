surgery<00:00:17.050> just<00:00:17.680> a<00:00:17.800> bit<00:00:18.130> different<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.720> what<00:00:19.930> if

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
surgery just a bit different but what if

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.990 
surgery just a bit different but what if
you<00:00:20.140> knew<00:00:20.320> exactly<00:00:21.040> what<00:00:21.700> you<00:00:21.850> were<00:00:21.970> looking

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
them is practicing before the game so we

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800 
them is practicing before the game so we
looked<00:01:05.890> at<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.250> thought<00:01:06.539> why<00:01:07.539> is<00:01:07.570> it

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
looked at that and thought why is it

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.200 
looked at that and thought why is it
that<00:01:07.930> health<00:01:08.110> care<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.380> not<00:01:08.409> doing<00:01:08.740> that

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
started a few years ago when the

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.800 
started a few years ago when the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
heart and other lifelike organs but that

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.410 
heart and other lifelike organs but that
was<00:01:23.619> just<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.070> beginning<00:01:24.189> and<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.299> had

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
was just the beginning and so we had

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.300 
was just the beginning and so we had
surgical<00:01:25.810> Sam<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.140> place<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.590> we<00:01:26.649> were<00:01:26.740> doing

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
surgical Sam in place and we were doing

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.429 
surgical Sam in place and we were doing
operations<00:01:27.609> in<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.240> simulator<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:28.869> then<00:01:29.380> we

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
operations in the simulator and then we

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.749 
operations in the simulator and then we
started<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.770> push<00:01:30.009> ourselves<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:30.609> said

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
started to push ourselves and we said

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.889 
started to push ourselves and we said
how<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:30.939> we<00:01:31.030> make<00:01:31.179> this<00:01:31.299> even<00:01:31.479> more<00:01:31.600> relevant

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
how can we make this even more relevant

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.149 
how can we make this even more relevant
and<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.350> that's<00:01:32.590> where<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:32.770> brought<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.039> first

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
and so that's where we brought the first

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.260 
and so that's where we brought the first
three-dimensional<00:01:33.820> printer

something dr. Smith could practice on
this<00:03:46.520> is<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:46.790> view<00:03:47.210> from<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.690> back<00:03:47.960> of<00:03:48.140> his<00:03:48.230> head

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
this is a view from the back of his head

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.770 
this is a view from the back of his head
sort<00:03:49.100> of<00:03:49.220> in<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.460> orientation<00:03:50.030> right<00:03:50.450> here

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
sort of in this orientation right here

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.630 
sort of in this orientation right here
and<00:03:50.990> what<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:51.800> can<00:03:51.920> do<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.100> actually<00:03:52.250> put<00:03:52.550> this

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
and what I can do is actually put this

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.250 
and what I can do is actually put this
on<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.850> light<00:03:53.060> box<00:03:53.270> in<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.510> operating<00:03:53.870> room<00:03:54.080> and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
on a light box in the operating room and

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.080 
on a light box in the operating room and
I<00:03:54.380> can<00:03:54.560> actually<00:03:54.740> see<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.550> blood<00:03:55.760> vessel

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
I can actually see the blood vessel

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.000 
I can actually see the blood vessel
malformation<00:03:56.810> right<00:03:57.410> through<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.770> brain

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
malformation right through the brain

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.380 
malformation right through the brain
like<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.460> have<00:03:58.610> x-ray<00:03:58.970> vision

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
like I have x-ray vision

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.840 
like I have x-ray vision
they<00:03:59.780> also<00:03:59.990> printed<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:01.010> blood<00:04:01.430> vessels

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
they also printed out the blood vessels

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.270 
they also printed out the blood vessels
themselves<00:04:02.540> which<00:04:03.020> are<00:04:03.170> seated<00:04:03.560> inside<00:04:04.100> of

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
the brain just like this so I can rotate

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.980 
the brain just like this so I can rotate
this<00:04:06.860> model<00:04:07.310> around<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.880> can<00:04:08.390> see<00:04:08.690> where<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
this model around I can see where the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.930 
this model around I can see where the
important<00:04:09.470> pipes<00:04:09.680> are<00:04:09.980> coming<00:04:10.520> in<00:04:10.730> and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
important pipes are coming in and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.260 
important pipes are coming in and
draining<00:04:11.450> out<00:04:12.100> good<00:04:13.100> thing<00:04:13.340> because<00:04:13.640> Adams

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
draining out good thing because Adams
