good<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.529> got<00:00:19.980> got<00:00:20.789> some<00:00:20.820> pretty

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
good just because I got got some pretty

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.779 
good just because I got got some pretty
cool<00:00:21.210> killed<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> felt<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.890> awesome<00:00:23.460> during

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
cool killed I felt really awesome during

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.070 
cool killed I felt really awesome during
the<00:00:23.910> game<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> end<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> pretty<00:00:24.930> good

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the game I end up with a pretty good

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.580 
the game I end up with a pretty good
score<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.039> usually<00:00:26.849> don't<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.750> don't<00:00:28.170> want

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
score I usually don't like I don't want

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.380 
score I usually don't like I don't want
to<00:00:28.680> upload<00:00:28.980> swatches<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.760> don't<00:00:29.970> play

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to upload swatches because I don't play

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.150 
to upload swatches because I don't play
swat<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.439> SWAT<00:00:31.920> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
swat and I don't really think SWAT is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.240 
swat and I don't really think SWAT is
all<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.780> skill-based<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.160> it's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
all really to skill-based I think it's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
all really to skill-based I think it's
more<00:00:35.309> based<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.739> predicting<00:00:37.739> spawns<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.809> just

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
more based on predicting spawns and just

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.860 
more based on predicting spawns and just
reflexes<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:41.070> really<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.640> hard<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.690> not

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
reflexes not really that hard it's not

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
reflexes not really that hard it's not
what<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.200> usually<00:00:43.500> play<00:00:44.030> but<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> decide<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
what I usually play but I decide to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.290 
what I usually play but I decide to
upload<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.050> there's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> special<00:00:46.980> little

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
upload it and there's a special little

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.850 
upload it and there's a special little
clip<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.780> end<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.620> short

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
clip at the end it's a little short

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.049 
clip at the end it's a little short
thing<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> thought<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> cool

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
thing but I thought it was kind of cool

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.990 
thing but I thought it was kind of cool
and<00:00:51.210> I've<00:00:51.329> been<00:00:51.420> meaning<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.190> put<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> into<00:00:53.489> one
