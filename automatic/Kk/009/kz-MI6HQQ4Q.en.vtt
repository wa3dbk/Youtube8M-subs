00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:11.250
 I got xperia z 4 from Sony 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.350
 Um z 4 so has not been published in the wmc the Na great deal what will ahead of the story 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.550
 I thought 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.740
 I think that this article is easy to understand the difference from え z 3 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.460
 Right 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:30.739
 It was 6.9 mm and it was 6.9 mm thick 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 It was 0.4 mm thinner because z 3 was 7.3 mm 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:37.770
 And 144g sound error say is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 Because if it was z it was 152 grams 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.280
 It means that it became 8 grams lighter 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.120
 So radar 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.560
 It does not seem to be purple 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.079
 It is important here 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.890
 And I no longer cap of micro usb terminal 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:03.240
 It became possible to connect the usb cable without opening the cover 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 With capless waterproofing a accompanies magnet type inside 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:14.170
 The search for electricity was omitted 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.430
 It says that it became a specification to put the micro sd and that sim on one tray. 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.520
 And it was in this kind of wind 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:28.310
 The main camera has not changed with z 3 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:32.000
 Yep camera 6 evolved and the number of pixels is 5.1 million 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.110
 By the way, it was 2.2 million pixels available 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 It's the more than double has become the source 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.780
 I also coped with l tag 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:48.299
 Do you take a look at the comparison of the appearance You're Toko last say 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.299
 This is z 4 cat z 3 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:58.320
 I Film has not changed the guard surface configuration 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.009
 As this is android 5.0, the shape of the icon changes like this 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.460
 Ne 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.290
 Before It was this kind of form 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.950
 I guess would be the difference of about it 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.060
 Then it's back next time 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.060
 Rather 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.030
 I see 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.069
 Camera and flash of this neighborhood 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.069
 1 or something has not changed at all 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.520
 I wonder if this nfc 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.520
 It is a mark of nfc 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:36.160
 I 'm not here but this is probably a global model 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:39.610
 Do you think we corresponding to the attached sheet of sometimes of course will be launched in Japan 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.640
 That's right, isn't it 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:51.730
 Next screen is up z is z z 3 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.650
 Like this , it became a capless waterproof usb terminal 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:59.439
 That's this strap hole 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.439
 There was nothing here before z Water 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.030
 With headphone jack 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.480
 Is the position of the microphone a little different? 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:15.110
 This left side 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:20.209
 I wonder if this is the slot of Kashim and micro sd card 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:26.450
 There was such a magnet type charging terminal before delivery 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.340
 It was a while ago of the mini grandfather noodles and I was no longer z 4 I Koch's left side 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.269
 Get out 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.250
 The position of the original button and the volume button 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.510
 It 1 has changed little 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:44.880
 There was a micro sd card here before but 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:49.610
 There is no feeling that it is natural to have a camera button 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.610
 It is a summary by saying 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.720
 Well It is a growth evolution of basically set 3 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.780
 I don't feel that there is a special big update , but personally micro usb 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.500
 It is great to Tteyuu became a cap-less waterproof 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:11.950
 It says that the method of charging has become universal 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.910
 The meaning is great, and of course there are fewer parts, so it will be lighter . 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.019
 Because there is a merit also in such a point 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.090
 It is the place that is most anxious about what the price will be after 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.090
 I do not know well right now
