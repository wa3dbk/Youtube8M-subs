00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.919
 For a long time the walls of 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.230
 peguche and atauntaqui have a voice 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.830
 irreverent charged with an explosion of 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.619
 Beetle color will be simpler 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:22.430
 now they are more complex, more detailed and 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.920
 they have a little more realism is the voice 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.710
 of tenacious a young man who has turned 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 these cement walls on a canvas of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:54.649
 strength and dignity my name is Alvaro 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.670
 I am from the peguche community 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.350
 I dedicate myself to what is city art with the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:08.780
 spray technique 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:13.130
 the sprays my stage name is 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 ternas and they put me like that because when 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.470
 graffiti on the cities or 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.100
 communities the comments of the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.610
 friends said it's something issues from 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.610
 there when they put me in 9 subjects 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.490
 from the garden I liked what is the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.670
 drawing are not enough in the years I entered the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.479
 school 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.290
 sometimes I traveled and I saw the graffiti on 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.290
 the cities there is when I liked it 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.350
 impacted this technique of aerosols and 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.259
 since that's when I started using 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 this technique and identify myself with what 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.220
 it's graffiti 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.120
 already with the dedication and practice I have gone 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.970
 improving in what is the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.150
 graffiti in hyperrealism the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.120
 hyperrealism is the graffiti that is made 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.510
 the organism of a photograph where you 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.870
 it is almost 100% identical to the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.870
 Photo 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.640
 as an indigenous person like to carry 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:39.379
 proudly in my culture this has not 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.849
 been my fundamental basis for 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.870
 identify myself in the graffiti with the 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.870
 indigenous not 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.140
 and I think that my dream in the act already 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 I'm living because it's always been my 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.840
 I dream of catching a spray and painting and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.840
 especially livable 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.680
 almost everywhere graffiti is 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.400
 recommends synonymous with hooliganism at 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.400
 that our idea with laws and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.100
 otherwise it is not a form of free 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:36.590
 express yourself and we see 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.190
 with a form of revolution like about 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 the system 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.569
 I have dedicated myself more I have improved more in 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.239
 the works although not always 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.780
 in the society in which we are 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.989
 we of the artists if there are 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.900
 supports not sometimes that has been the test 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.799
 harder to do things to follow 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.180
 being an artist, but not like that, there are people 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:11.750
 who knows how they appreciate art 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.170
 spaces give you work each person we 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.690
 support with a grain of sand to see 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.150
 that graffiti does not die 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.750
 then that's when we 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.750
 we decided to express ourselves more strongly
