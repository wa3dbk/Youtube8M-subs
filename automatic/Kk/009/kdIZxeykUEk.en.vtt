00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
there's a direct impact right there but

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.799 
there's a direct impact right there but
those<00:00:30.679> like<00:00:31.679> oh<00:00:31.710> yes<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.160> um<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.809> haven't

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
those like oh yes but um I haven't

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
those like oh yes but um I haven't
played<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.469> map<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> first

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
played this map but this is the first

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
played this map but this is the first
time<00:00:36.120> i<00:00:36.180> played<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.719> despite<00:00:37.200> me<00:00:37.410> being<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
time i played it despite me being I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.799 
time i played it despite me being I
think<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.850> around<00:00:39.030> level<00:00:39.480> 20

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
think I was like around level 20

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
think I was like around level 20
something<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.920> play<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> I'd

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
something in this game play and I'd

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
something in this game play and I'd
never<00:00:42.030> played<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.540> map<00:00:42.750> before<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
never played this map before and so you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
never played this map before and so you
see<00:00:44.280> me<00:00:44.670> fro<00:00:44.850> nade<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> beginning<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
see me fro nade at the beginning I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
see me fro nade at the beginning I
thought<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.200> spawned<00:00:46.559> over<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.730> an

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
thought they spawned over there just an

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.490 
thought they spawned over there just an
assumption<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.600> obviously<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.260> didn't

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
assumption and obviously they didn't

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100 
assumption and obviously they didn't
they<00:00:49.590> spawn<00:00:49.860> across<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> map<00:00:50.780> which<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.960> should

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
they spawn across the map which I should

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.209 
they spawn across the map which I should
have<00:00:52.199> anticipated<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.129> not

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
have anticipated because you're not

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
have anticipated because you're not
going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> spawn<00:00:53.610> sideways<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.360> enemy<00:00:54.690> but

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
going to spawn sideways to the enemy but

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
going to spawn sideways to the enemy but
uh<00:00:54.920> yeah<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.949> learned<00:00:56.190> from<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.879> where<00:00:57.059> the

fear mode it wasn't there i'm assuming
that's<00:02:35.340> because<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.849> host<00:02:36.090> left<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:37.650> uh<00:02:37.680> yeah

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
that's because the host left but uh yeah

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.100 
that's because the host left but uh yeah
i've<00:02:38.580> been<00:02:38.610> relying<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.239> fier<00:02:39.510> mode<00:02:39.720> too<00:02:39.930> much

because<00:05:21.590> in<00:05:21.740> cod4<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.370> found<00:05:22.730> it<00:05:22.880> well<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.180> I

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
because in cod4 I found it well it I

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.120 
because in cod4 I found it well it I
think<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:23.960> got<00:05:24.140> caught<00:05:24.350> out<00:05:24.500> i<00:05:24.560> was<00:05:24.830> using<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
think I got caught out i was using the

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.400 
think I got caught out i was using the
UMP<00:05:25.580> too<00:05:25.760> much<00:05:25.970> in<00:05:26.240> modern<00:05:26.780> warfare<00:05:26.900> 2<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.230> was

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
UMP too much in modern warfare 2 I was

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.630 
UMP too much in modern warfare 2 I was
hoping<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:27.710> could<00:05:27.770> jump<00:05:28.070> on<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.250> roof<00:05:28.430> there

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
hoping you could jump on the roof there

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.580 
hoping you could jump on the roof there
but<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:28.850> failed<00:05:29.120> as<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.360> said<00:05:29.990> earlier<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.410> don't

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
but I failed as I said earlier I don't

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.980 
but I failed as I said earlier I don't
in<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.770> map<00:05:30.890> at<00:05:31.010> all<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:31.570> I'm<00:05:32.570> hey<00:05:32.810> I'm

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
in the map at all so I'm hey I'm

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.810 
in the map at all so I'm hey I'm
figuring<00:05:33.830> out<00:05:33.950> but<00:05:34.130> this<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.640> go-to

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
figuring out but this is the go-to

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.560 
figuring out but this is the go-to
building<00:05:36.460> just<00:05:37.460> generally<00:05:37.880> cuz<00:05:38.060> it's<00:05:38.240> easy<00:05:38.390> to

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
building just generally cuz it's easy to

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.980 
building just generally cuz it's easy to
hold<00:05:38.690> down<00:05:38.900> motion<00:05:39.560> sensors<00:05:40.780> there<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.870> way

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
hold down motion sensors there the way

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.410 
hold down motion sensors there the way
to<00:05:42.050> go<00:05:42.260> in<00:05:42.410> this<00:05:42.440> game<00:05:42.740> if<00:05:42.950> I'm<00:05:43.070> honest

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
to go in this game if I'm honest

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.520 
to go in this game if I'm honest
claymores<00:05:44.420> you<00:05:44.690> need<00:05:44.810> to<00:05:45.020> get<00:05:45.140> one<00:05:45.290> of<00:05:45.410> them

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
claymores you need to get one of them

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.800 
claymores you need to get one of them
that's<00:05:46.100> one<00:05:46.280> kill<00:05:46.550> with<00:05:46.820> motion<00:05:47.210> sensors<00:05:47.390> you

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
that's one kill with motion sensors you

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.570 
that's one kill with motion sensors you
can<00:05:47.840> detect<00:05:48.470> pretty<00:05:48.710> much<00:05:48.860> anyone<00:05:49.190> going<00:05:49.430> into

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
can detect pretty much anyone going into

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.600 
can detect pretty much anyone going into
the<00:05:49.700> buildin<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.120> think<00:05:50.360> ghost<00:05:50.660> pro<00:05:51.400> hide<00:05:52.400> you

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
the buildin I think ghost pro hide you

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.030 
the buildin I think ghost pro hide you
from<00:05:52.700> it<00:05:52.880> but<00:05:53.000> ghost<00:05:53.270> doesn't<00:05:53.690> &amp;<00:05:54.020> provo<00:05:54.680> pro

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040
