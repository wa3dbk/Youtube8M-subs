00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
running to the ball sideways and then

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.170 
running to the ball sideways and then
I'm<00:02:13.890> ready<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.159> hit<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.489> ball

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
I'm ready to hit the ball

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.110 
I'm ready to hit the ball
so<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.689> first<00:02:15.959> step<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.470> if<00:02:17.430> I'm<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so the first step is if I'm going to the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.960 
so the first step is if I'm going to the
right<00:02:18.360> I'm<00:02:19.110> moving<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.769> way<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.939> going

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
right I'm moving in this way I'm going

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.860 
right I'm moving in this way I'm going
to<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> left

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to the left

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:46.640 
to the left
my<00:02:22.260> leg<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.500> turning<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.040> way<00:02:45.409> arrow<00:02:46.409> two

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
my leg is turning this way arrow two

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.960 
my leg is turning this way arrow two
drills<00:02:46.950> are<00:02:47.159> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> help<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.670> improve

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
drills are going to help you improve

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.050 
drills are going to help you improve
your<00:02:48.230> first<00:02:49.230> step<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.799> ball<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.190> getting

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
your first step to the ball and getting

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.559 
your first step to the ball and getting
to<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.269> ball<00:02:51.389> on<00:02:51.510> time<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.709> is

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
to the ball on time so the first one is

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.280 
to the ball on time so the first one is
normal<00:02:54.569> ready<00:02:54.720> position

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
normal ready position

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.710 
normal ready position
normal<00:02:55.590> split<00:02:55.889> step<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:57.000> tuck<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.510> one

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
normal split step and then tuck in one

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.750 
normal split step and then tuck in one
leg<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:57.989> run<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.739> couple<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.099> steps<00:02:59.310> towards

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
leg and run a couple of steps towards

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.460 
leg and run a couple of steps towards
that<00:02:59.819> direction<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.629> let's<00:03:00.810> say<00:03:01.049> I'm<00:03:01.109> going<00:03:01.170> to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that direction so let's say I'm going to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.119 
that direction so let's say I'm going to
my<00:03:01.590> back<00:03:01.799> end<00:03:02.569> split<00:03:03.569> step<00:03:04.409> push<00:03:04.920> off

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
my back end split step push off

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.550 
my back end split step push off
and<00:03:05.909> back<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.209> your<00:03:06.299> ready<00:03:06.420> position<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:07.470> I'm

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and back to your ready position now I'm

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.009 
and back to your ready position now I'm
going<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.889> my<00:03:08.040> right<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.459> my<00:03:08.489> forehand<00:03:09.019> split

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
going to my right to my forehand split

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:10.339 
going to my right to my forehand split
step

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
step

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:22.280 
step
tuck<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.709> push<00:03:11.069> off

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.170 

so<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.370> see<00:03:23.580> there<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.790> was<00:03:24.030> really

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
so as you can see there I was really

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.080 
so as you can see there I was really
focusing<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:24.900> turning<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.920> body<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.459> running

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
focusing on turning the body and running

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.479 
focusing on turning the body and running
to<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.269> ball<00:03:27.450> sideways<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.709> rather<00:03:29.280> than

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
to the ball sideways on rather than

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.520 
to the ball sideways on rather than
running<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:29.939> ball<00:03:30.060> front<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.689> and<00:03:30.900> then

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
running to the ball front on and then

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.050 
running to the ball front on and then
when<00:03:31.709> they<00:03:31.799> get<00:03:31.980> there<00:03:32.159> having<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.519> turn<00:03:32.760> so

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
when they get there having to turn so

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.539 
when they get there having to turn so
the<00:03:33.180> big<00:03:33.420> focus<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.170> turning<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.099> body<00:03:35.310> and

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
the big focus is on turning the body and

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.119 
the big focus is on turning the body and
getting<00:03:36.150> shoulders<00:03:36.810> sideways<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:37.980> you're

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
getting shoulders sideways so you're

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.759 
getting shoulders sideways so you're
running<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.519> ball<00:03:38.670> sideways<00:03:39.239> on<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.650> if

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
running to the ball sideways on so if

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.350 
running to the ball sideways on so if
it's<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.980> forehand<00:03:41.310> I'm<00:03:41.489> running<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:41.909> ball

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
it's a forehand I'm running to the ball

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.160 
it's a forehand I'm running to the ball
I'm<00:03:42.840> watching<00:03:43.230> my<00:03:43.260> my<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.280> tracking<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.970> ball

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'm watching my my I'm tracking the ball

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.539

over my left shoulder if I'm a

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.250 
over my left shoulder if I'm a
right-handed<00:03:48.000> player<00:03:48.269> if<00:03:48.810> there's<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.049> back

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
right-handed player if there's a back

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.380 
right-handed player if there's a back
end<00:03:49.530> I'm<00:03:49.709> tracking<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.190> ball<00:03:50.310> over<00:03:51.030> my<00:03:51.180> right

the ball over my right shoulder like

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.770 
the ball over my right shoulder like
this<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.590> drill<00:03:56.459> number<00:03:56.609> two<00:03:56.909> it's<00:03:57.599> very

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
this and drill number two it's very

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.960 
this and drill number two it's very
similar<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> first<00:03:58.799> one<00:03:58.890> but<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.790> need<00:03:59.940> a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
similar to the first one but you need a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.149 
similar to the first one but you need a
couple<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.389> cones<00:04:00.629> or<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.379> need<00:04:01.530> maybe<00:04:01.799> a

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
couple of cones or you need maybe a

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.180 
couple of cones or you need maybe a
couple<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.700> water<00:04:02.909> bottles<00:04:04.010> you're<00:04:05.010> going<00:04:05.129> to

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
couple of water bottles you're going to

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.390 
couple of water bottles you're going to
get<00:04:05.310> behind<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.849> like<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:06.769> jump<00:04:07.769> over<00:04:08.190> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
get behind it like this jump over and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.289 
get behind it like this jump over and
then<00:04:09.239> turn<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.750> sprint<00:04:10.940> this<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.090> going<00:04:12.239> to

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
then turn and sprint this is going to

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.879 
then turn and sprint this is going to
work<00:04:12.329> also<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.019> split<00:04:13.290> step<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.769> it's

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
work also on the split step so it's

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.289 
work also on the split step so it's
going<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.069> make<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> split<00:04:14.609> step<00:04:14.760> more<00:04:14.940> more

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
going to make a split step more more

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.890 
going to make a split step more more
explosive<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.709> behind<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.250> cones<00:04:17.630> jump<00:04:18.630> over

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
explosive so behind the cones jump over

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:32.720 
explosive so behind the cones jump over
them

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.120 

once<00:04:33.300> again<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.720> focus<00:04:34.110> really<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
once again the focus really is on the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.580 
once again the focus really is on the
shoulder<00:04:35.670> turn<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.030> turning<00:04:36.900> sideways<00:04:37.200> so

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
shoulder turn and turning sideways so

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.260 
shoulder turn and turning sideways so
you're<00:04:37.710> running<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.220> ball<00:04:38.340> sideways<00:04:39.030> on

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
you're running to the ball sideways on

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.930 
you're running to the ball sideways on
you<00:04:39.990> want<00:04:40.170> to<00:04:40.290> really<00:04:40.440> avoid<00:04:40.800> going<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.700> ball

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
you want to really avoid going to a ball

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.030 
you want to really avoid going to a ball
like<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.140> then<00:04:43.230> having<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.530> turn<00:04:43.800> at<00:04:43.980> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
like this and then having to turn at the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.890 
like this and then having to turn at the
last<00:04:44.250> second<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.820> want<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.390> get<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.720> ball

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
last second you want to get to the ball

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.980
