00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 as I speak like testik blows 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 kicking that very often doing a spin 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 on one leg leading to crossings 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.790
 of balance â€” is your system a system 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.380
 blows but communication is very good then you 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.640
 just fall and fill up if done and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.609
 no technical action 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.010
 I suggest doing rotation is not easy 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.080
 rotations do well too inner 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 by cutting something else and thereby 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.580
 moving to strike this blow with 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.379
 reversal as you look again 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.559
 step over you can already easily hit 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.750
 where am I turning in this video 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.479
 rotation not 360 degrees and not even on 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.510
 180 see drive and I have already turned 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.610
 same turned and gave that performing 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.949
 reverse continue to 8 understand this in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.379
 dynamics to the end that I say goodbye wait 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.610
 it turns out that we can die as not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.869
 hit a side turn anything 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.640
 the system works the same way in this 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.500
 hit that in the other on that in any other 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.270
 at the dedication gate but we do not lose 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.430
 steadily absolute to us absolutely 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.880
 right to combine and hit will help because 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.320
 circular side just turn and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.260
 further after the turn with ours 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 these punches mean very effectively on 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.570
 meeting 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.130
 attack counter movements 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.620
 counterattack care and aside very important 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.660
 moment if I let my leg be 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.680
 God will say buy fake 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.200
 here the attack 1 2 is also side by side with the line of the line 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:44.979
 you're gone and I can also strike 40 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 committed once again two goes i will 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.539
 walk on let's kant scum case 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.970
 to the head or even just battle or 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.229
 dirty trick i don't have a good stretch with 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.190
 korando i can hit we fast 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.950
 principle this 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.470
 attack here for attack better like 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.160
 start with our hands finish our to 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.890
 rival 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.660
 deuce miss it just a group of darkness 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.610
 already talked cockedheads when if we 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.380
 will show our blow to the effects 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.030
 it will be minimal we do not strike with them 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.610
 hide on the last only in the ultimate 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.930
 phase 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.600
 make a movement then this punch is up to the pain in 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.209
 Those are just not just a card prevented 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.630
 but on counter attacks he too 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.940
 no 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.769
 rival goes here already more tequila 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.970
 side kick because like kick 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.610
 the counter is about to shorter 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.920
 more spectacular more film finale we 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.819
 We see that is, there is pounced too 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.569
 plus 3 full 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.230
 also did not apply such yes come in 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.689
 farther 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 delving into the technique of kicks can 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.260
 prosecco output to yourself and to the Internet 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.310
 perry jumps and often makes a law yes y 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.340
 us here perry jumping will fall assoka not 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.540
 pounded the ring in a panic because not 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.680
 you know what to do where the blow comes from 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.159
 jump to rock she is a count from where that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.799
 will go 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:15.849
 No one knows and no one understands that 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:19.450
 lit why can't we 33 came here 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.870
 cottage and so on, that is why 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.870
 can't do
