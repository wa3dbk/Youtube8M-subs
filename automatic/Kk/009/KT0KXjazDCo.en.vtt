once<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> buy<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> chart<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> simply<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
once you buy the chart you simply put it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
once you buy the chart you simply put it
into<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> unit<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.149> sure

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
into the unit and you want to make sure

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
into the unit and you want to make sure
that<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.570> satellite<00:00:54.930> over<00:00:55.350> light<00:00:55.500> first<00:00:55.829> off

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that your satellite over light first off

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130 
that your satellite over light first off
is<00:00:56.250> turned<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> your

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
is turned on so you want to go to your

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.580 
is turned on so you want to go to your
home<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.660> you<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> check<00:01:01.020> under<00:01:01.170> setup

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
home and you want to check under setup

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.399 
home and you want to check under setup
we<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.010> look<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.340> setup<00:01:03.080> we<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.199> check

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
we will look at setup we are check

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.730 
we will look at setup we are check
cartography<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:06.229> we're<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> scroll<00:01:07.680> on

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
cartography and we're going to scroll on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.410 
cartography and we're going to scroll on
down<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> bottom<00:01:09.060> where<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.439> have

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
down to the bottom where we then have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.380 
down to the bottom where we then have
our<00:01:13.430> aerial<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.729> leg<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
our aerial over leg and this is a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
our aerial over leg and this is a
satellite<00:01:15.960> overlay<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> turn

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
satellite overlay so you want to turn

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
satellite overlay so you want to turn
the<00:01:17.280> aerial<00:01:17.640> overlay<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.020> land<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> see

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the aerial overlay to on to land and see

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
the aerial overlay to on to land and see
or<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.400> land<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.240> we're<00:01:21.390> doing

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
or just on land but because we're doing

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
or just on land but because we're doing
a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> these<00:01:21.960> creeks<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.710> land

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
a lot of these creeks we want on land

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
a lot of these creeks we want on land
and<00:01:23.130> sea<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.450> show<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and sea to really show up all the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
and sea to really show up all the
waterways<00:01:26.180> once<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.479> we're<00:01:27.810> going

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
waterways once we have that we're going

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.920 
waterways once we have that we're going

overlays again satellite over light and
you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.280> turn<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.549> aerial<00:01:42.000> over<00:01:42.299> line<00:01:42.479> all

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you can turn your aerial over line all

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.120 
you can turn your aerial over line all
the<00:01:42.899> way<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> shading<00:01:43.890> feature

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the way up this is a shading feature

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.380 
the way up this is a shading feature
that<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> plotters<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.360> can

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that all the plotters have where you can

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
that all the plotters have where you can
shade<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.200> depending<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.829> detail<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
shade in a depending on what detail you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
shade in a depending on what detail you
want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.020> all

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
want to see so we're going to put it all

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100 
want to see so we're going to put it all
the<00:01:49.290> way<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:51.990> the

the way up and you can see the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
the way up and you can see the
difference<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> resolution

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.429 
and if we zoom in and out on the chart
you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.890> actually<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.909> clear<00:02:00.570> these

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you can actually see how clear these

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.760 
you can actually see how clear these
creeks<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.729> Bayou<00:02:02.969> show<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
really really opens up those areas that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.330 
really really opens up those areas that

one foot when I turn that on I now open

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.250 
one foot when I turn that on I now open
up<00:03:28.830> all<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.580> new<00:03:29.820> cartography<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.570> contour

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
up all this new cartography and contour

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.320 
up all this new cartography and contour
lines<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.740> one<00:03:31.950> foot<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:33.300> I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
lines to one foot and you can see what I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.090 
lines to one foot and you can see what I
highlighted<00:03:33.900> white<00:03:34.110> it's<00:03:34.440> showing<00:03:34.860> there's<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
highlighted white it's showing there's a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.370 
highlighted white it's showing there's a
big<00:03:35.280> shallow<00:03:35.580> area<00:03:35.940> right<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.540> also<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
big shallow area right here and also a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
deep hole in the corner so this is

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.540 
deep hole in the corner so this is
really<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> helpful<00:03:40.230> backup<00:03:40.830> or<00:03:40.950> even<00:03:41.160> sitting
