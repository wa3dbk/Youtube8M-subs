00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.609
 hello today I will teach you one of the ways 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:10.640
 that exist to be able to create your own 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.910
 decorative paper for worth the 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.060
 redundancy decorate all your creations 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.400
 for this good we're going to need the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.400
 microsoft office publisher program 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.360
 and after we have it, we're going to give it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.430
 here in blank page sizes 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.529
 to click and here we see the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.930
 different formats 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.379
 for this we are going to need a size 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.940
 letter that is like the conventional size 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:46.680
 that accepts our printer and then the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:49.930
 leaves in this case of 27.94 x 21 59 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.790
 think then horizontally or 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.920
 vertical for this design I will choose 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.519
 a horizontal shape 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.900
 well let's open and we will appear as 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.360
 the scheme 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.540
 then on the web you will look for any 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.030
 image that you like and which you want 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.520
 make like the decorative paper in this 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.770
 when I will make a chevron I have to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.020
 every two models we are going to do the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.530
 yellow 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.050
 to explain a little 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.270
 when you choose the image 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.100
 it has to have continuity what 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.560
 it means 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.770
 must as continue the sequence of the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.440
 image is to say that if you start here in 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.580
 the left side on the right side should be 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.149
 as I continue to continue the scene of 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.450
 left side then for example here 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.850
 on the left side of your screens 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.430
 this fallen peak appears here as you see 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.289
 there is also the fallen beak on the side 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.030
 right and here on the left side can 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.580
 get back up like the little triangle 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.409
 to follow the sequence then the 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.800
 sequence must be followed from left to 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:09.850
 right and both up and down as 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.060
 we see up here is the peaks 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.739
 but here below is only this without 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.269
 finish for this we can simply 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.269
 fix it in 20 then let's open 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.269
 paint 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.450
 and here we are going to drag the image 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.500
 when it's here, let's give it here 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.560
 in select 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.010
 and we are going to 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 draw as the line the entire box of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.209
 what we want out 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.310
 and the idea is that they do not get to see 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.710
 these peaks and here below those that are 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.360
 without finishing how to cut them 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.840
 but without cutting those who follow him already 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.510
 that we have the figure we give here in 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.590
 this tool that says trim and 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.810
 ready 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.930
 well and now we just keep 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.920
 when we have it 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.920
 we drag 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.920
 and here you can enlarge or decrease your 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.920
 size 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.490
 out there for it 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.550
 and we're going to put it here on the sidelines of 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.050
 sheet 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.300
 then we'll right click copy 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.110
 Right click again you will see how you see 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.310
 it will have doubled and now we are going to 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.820
 paste it right next to us we are going to give 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.860
 again click paste again we are going to 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.010
 insert next to paste and again into the 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.879
 A) Yes 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.879
 then we will give again and below 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.129
 as you see the sequence follows 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.159
 the rules if you feel right from 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.740
 left to right and top to 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.510
 down 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.510
 well you also have to have 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.479
 an important fact that is that the figure 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.090
 it must seem real that it does not look like 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.030
 it is inserted part by part but it is 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.470
 see the sequence to be certain of 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.750
 we're doing well, we 're going to 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.110
 give you here in preliminary view 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.940
 and this is going to throw us 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.980
 like this mini screen and here we are going to 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.160
 to be able to see better 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.980
 if we are doing it well normal as 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.430
 come here we can zoom in a bit here 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.300
 note that it is cut and stuck the same 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.080
 here and here here in this one above and this 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.060
 down 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.840
 yes yes it is well back we have to paste 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.380
 are these 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.880
 a bit then let's give it here in 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.000
 Zoom in 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.060
 this tool is important because 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.820
 so you can have it as more definition and 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.390
 give yourself how to paste a little more 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.640
 images millimetrically things that 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.930
 have been the most you can not then 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.139
 well let's paste the were 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.639
 unicrÃ©dito just 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:32.919
 there as they are a few small millimeters 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.240
 that when it is in real size 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.449
 do not join 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.120
 write down and ready 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.960
 that there is another 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.960
 and again we give in view tools 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.680
 preliminary 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.500
 as you can see it has already been removed has 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.090
 eliminated those white lines that 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.550
 they saw 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.960
 so then, since it's like this, we're going to 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.449
 continue 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.660
 then we remove a little bit the 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.380
 image zoom out 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.380
 and again 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.930
 chopped and we will continue 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.930
 doing the same 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.770
 until finishing the whole sheet and having 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.849
 Therefore, it must be well done 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.120
 let's keep looking here this here 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.130
 and the latter 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.610
 they separated me so you have to 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.610
 join them 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.229
 can you do 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.540
 any kind of design always and 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:41.360
 how much 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.360
 follow the rule that is continuous 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.710
 and that's it 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.599
 well let's finish the whole sheet and 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.139
 ready when you have finished the 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.719
 entire sheet 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.200
 let's review last is that it 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:59.610
 it was good 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.699
 as we see we are going to bring a little closer 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.720
 ready has not been like any 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.030
 imperfection 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.980
 as big features there is no 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.650
 line 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:16.710
 and ready and when you are sure your 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:18.790
 design we closed here and I just wanted 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:24.280
 save 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:27.280
 just save here in click type 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.400
 over and you put 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.930
 I do not know how you want to save it / efe what 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.199
 Maybe it's pdf so you can 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:40.289
 at first more easily than I do not know 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:42.320
 you how to format or can you 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:48.539
 also save it as a word document 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:52.169
 or formats and good jpg you'll see there as 

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:54.870
 you keep it and ready as I said to the 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:58.350
 principle is just one of the ways that 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:02.910
 exist to make your own paper 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:05.070
 decorative I will investigate more forms and 

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.830
 Well, if you want, I could 

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.580
 to be uploading this was the video of the 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:13.830
 week if you liked it do not forget to comment 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.849
 subscribe and like thank you very much

 and may god bless you
