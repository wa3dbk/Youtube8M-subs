00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
angle and you've got to realize that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
angle and you've got to realize that
there's<00:01:30.510> three<00:01:30.780> layers<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.080> laminate<00:01:31.650> here

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

there's three layers of laminate here
and<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.280> ironed<00:01:32.400> them<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:32.940> once<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and I just ironed them all at once and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
and I just ironed them all at once and
fold<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> trim<00:01:34.410> them<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:40.190> one<00:01:41.190> side

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

we're<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.760> do<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.619> go<00:01:46.619> down<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
we're going to do the way I go down the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.469 
we're going to do the way I go down the
wing<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> single<00:01:47.850> stroke<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.300> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
middle and then from that middle I work

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
middle and then from that middle I work
my<00:01:50.550> way<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.060> edges<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:53.570> can<00:01:54.570> actually<00:01:54.869> do

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
my way to the edges I can actually do

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
my way to the edges I can actually do
this<00:01:55.200> fairly<00:01:55.350> quickly<00:01:56.180> there's<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> certain

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
this fairly quickly there's a certain

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.359 
this fairly quickly there's a certain
touch<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.649> sure<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.950> irons<00:01:59.250> the

touch to it make sure your irons the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
touch to it make sure your irons the
right<00:01:59.550> temperature<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.330> doesn't<00:02:00.660> change

the shape of your phone once again we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.400 
the shape of your phone once again we
get<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.420> corners<00:02:06.810> we've<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.229> trim

anywhere there's a band or an angle and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.870 
anywhere there's a band or an angle and
then<00:02:13.350> we<00:02:13.440> start<00:02:13.709> folding<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.280> over<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.760> just

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
then we start folding it over and just

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.690 
then we start folding it over and just
wrap<00:02:15.150> those<00:02:15.390> edges<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.920> want<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.190> overlap<00:02:17.489> at

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
wrap those edges you want to overlap at

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.430 
wrap those edges you want to overlap at
the<00:02:17.820> front<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.209> actually<00:02:18.570> adds<00:02:18.690> strength<00:02:19.140> to

the front it actually adds strength to

adds<00:02:27.690> strength<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> nose<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.950> plane

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
adds strength to the nose of the plane

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.259 
adds strength to the nose of the plane
to<00:02:29.489> have<00:02:29.640> an<00:02:29.760> overlap<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.420> nose<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:32.269> then

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
to have an overlap of the nose and then

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.910 
to have an overlap of the nose and then
you<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.540> work<00:02:33.750> your<00:02:33.930> way<00:02:34.080> around<00:02:36.920> stretching

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you just work your way around stretching

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.150 
you just work your way around stretching
it<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.250> go<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.459> iron<00:02:38.910> ended<00:02:39.269> employees

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
it as you go and iron ended employees

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.789 
it as you go and iron ended employees
trimming<00:02:41.160> off<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.459> excess<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.799> ironing

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
trimming off the excess and then ironing

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.830 
trimming off the excess and then ironing
down<00:02:44.070> any<00:02:44.370> edge<00:02:44.549> you've<00:02:44.820> got<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:48.269> laminate<00:02:48.690> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
down any edge you've got the laminate is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.509 
down any edge you've got the laminate is
important<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> model<00:02:49.860> because<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.400> a

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
important to the model because it's a

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.330 
important to the model because it's a
shield<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.180> prevents<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.140> UV<00:02:52.769> light<00:02:53.010> from

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
shield that prevents the UV light from

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.940 
shield that prevents the UV light from
reaching<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.910> model<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.440> UV<00:02:55.440> light<00:02:55.680> can

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
reaching the model and UV light can

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.789 
reaching the model and UV light can
break<00:02:56.160> down<00:02:56.190> both<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.000> EPP<00:02:57.600> foam<00:02:57.959> over<00:02:58.560> long

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
break down both the EPP foam over long

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.069 
break down both the EPP foam over long
periods<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.340> time<00:02:59.400> but<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.000> extreme<00:03:00.570> tape<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
periods of time but the extreme tape it

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.770 
periods of time but the extreme tape it
can<00:03:01.200> break<00:03:01.440> down<00:03:01.470> over<00:03:01.709> three<00:03:02.160> or<00:03:02.250> four<00:03:02.459> months

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
can break down over three or four months

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.949 
can break down over three or four months
so<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.709> laminate<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.670> UV<00:03:06.180> shield<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.900> is

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
so the laminate is a UV shield that is

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.380 
so the laminate is a UV shield that is
important<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.799> model<00:03:10.940> you'll<00:03:11.940> notice<00:03:12.150> as

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
important to the model you'll notice as

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.090 
important to the model you'll notice as
I<00:03:12.510> flipped<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.930> over<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.320> I'm<00:03:13.380> now<00:03:13.560> working<00:03:13.799> on

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
I flipped it over and I'm now working on

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.430 
I flipped it over and I'm now working on
the<00:03:14.280> bottom<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.480> did<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.840> same<00:03:16.049> thing<00:03:16.079> as

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the bottom that I did the same thing as

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.930 
the bottom that I did the same thing as
stroke<00:03:16.739> down<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.040> middle<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.340> then<00:03:17.489> work<00:03:17.730> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
stroke down the middle and then work to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.330 
stroke down the middle and then work to
the<00:03:18.060> edges<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:19.799> going<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:19.980> take<00:03:20.070> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the edges then I'm going to take the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.400 
the edges then I'm going to take the
scissors<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.910> split<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.299> any<00:03:21.510> place<00:03:22.110> there's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
scissors and split to any place there's

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.619 
scissors and split to any place there's
a<00:03:22.500> corner

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.149 

so<00:03:27.629> that<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:27.930> fold<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.439> up<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.829> straight

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
so that I can fold it up in a straight

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.190 
so that I can fold it up in a straight
line<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:33.180> case<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.599> need<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.870> trim<00:03:34.049> off

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
line in this case I need to trim off

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.770 
line in this case I need to trim off
some<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.709> extra<00:03:35.010> laminate<00:03:35.629> because<00:03:36.629> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
some of the extra laminate because the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.449 
some of the extra laminate because the
laminate<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.319> clear<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.620> can't<00:03:37.980> even<00:03:38.219> see<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
laminate is clear you can't even see the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.509 
laminate is clear you can't even see the
seam<00:03:38.879> I'm<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:39.569> concerned<00:03:40.129> that<00:03:41.129> I<00:03:41.159> have<00:03:41.400> an

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
seam I'm not so concerned that I have an

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.509 
seam I'm not so concerned that I have an
absolutely<00:03:41.909> perfect<00:03:42.090> cut<00:03:42.780> there<00:03:43.079> although

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
absolutely perfect cut there although

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.280 
absolutely perfect cut there although
many<00:03:44.519> times<00:03:44.819> I<00:03:44.969> will<00:03:45.180> use<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.389> straight<00:03:45.810> edge<00:03:45.840> to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
many times I will use a straight edge to

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.390 
many times I will use a straight edge to
make<00:03:46.409> a<00:03:46.469> very<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.920> better<00:03:47.189> cut<00:03:47.430> than<00:03:47.609> that

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
make a very a better cut than that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.679 
make a very a better cut than that
folding<00:03:50.400> now<00:03:50.549> for<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.939> corners<00:03:53.540> this<00:03:54.540> is

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
folding now for the corners this is

bend<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.349> olive<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:52.800> down<00:04:53.009> issue<00:04:53.250> tape<00:04:53.550> us<00:04:53.759> so

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
bend the olive on down issue tape us so

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.670 
bend the olive on down issue tape us so
that<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.150> elevon<00:04:54.509> will<00:04:54.660> still<00:04:54.960> go<00:04:55.110> down<00:04:55.349> and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
that the elevon will still go down and

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.760 
that the elevon will still go down and
stick<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.030> back<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.449> wing<00:05:00.770> let's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
stick it to the back of the wing let's

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.930 
stick it to the back of the wing let's
do<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.099> other<00:05:02.130> one<00:05:02.370> trim<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.360> edge<00:05:04.729> fold<00:05:05.729> it

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
do the other one trim the edge fold it

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.339 
do the other one trim the edge fold it
down<00:05:06.090> as<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.389> don't<00:05:06.599> see<00:05:06.750> how<00:05:06.840> I<00:05:06.870> lift<00:05:07.199> the

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
down as you don't see how I lift the

plane up and then just press it down it

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.390 
plane up and then just press it down it
gives<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.270> movement<00:05:09.419> in<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.840> elbow<00:05:10.400> now

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
gives you movement in the elbow now

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.249 
gives you movement in the elbow now
we're<00:05:11.550> going<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.849> split<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.900> other<00:05:13.020> piece<00:05:13.229> of

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
we're going to split the other piece of

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.089 
we're going to split the other piece of
tape<00:05:14.990> this<00:05:15.990> goes<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.470> bottom<00:05:16.710> of<00:05:16.979> the
