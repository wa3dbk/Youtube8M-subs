00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
is an amazing camera which of course it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.459 
is an amazing camera which of course it
is<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.640> they'll<00:00:35.940> also<00:00:36.360> tell<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.290> this

is but they'll also tell you that this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.780 
is but they'll also tell you that this
is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> very<00:00:38.129> solidly<00:00:38.850> built<00:00:39.420> camera<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.790> my

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is a very solidly built camera and my

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
is a very solidly built camera and my
take<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.719> they're<00:00:42.930> either

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
take on that is that they're either

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.650 
take on that is that they're either
testing<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.129> different<00:00:44.700> camera<00:00:45.000> different

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
testing a different camera different

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.220 
testing a different camera different
version<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> rx100<00:00:47.120> or<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:49.020> they're

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
version of the rx100 or that they're

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.880 
version of the rx100 or that they're
being<00:00:49.500> paid<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:50.280> Sony<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.210> am<00:00:52.050> NOT<00:00:52.289> being<00:00:52.559> paid

by Sony and I'll tell you like it is

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.290 
by Sony and I'll tell you like it is
it's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.460> nice<00:00:56.640> camera

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
it's a really nice camera

it's a really nice camera
it<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> solidly<00:00:59.129> built<00:00:59.370> camera<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it a weaker construction the camera is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.690 
it a weaker construction the camera is
also<00:01:38.150> extremely<00:01:39.150> slippery<00:01:40.430> there's<00:01:41.430> almost

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
also extremely slippery there's almost

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.649 
also extremely slippery there's almost
nothing<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.600> hold<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:45.329> goes<00:01:45.450> like

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
nothing to hold on to you it goes like

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.370 
nothing to hold on to you it goes like
this<00:01:46.759> turn<00:01:47.759> around<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.509> only<00:01:48.780> piece<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
this turn around the only piece that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.039 
this turn around the only piece that
adds<00:01:49.590> friction<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.119> tiny<00:01:51.659> little

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
adds friction here is this tiny little

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.800 
adds friction here is this tiny little
area<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.640> rubberized<00:01:54.000> over<00:01:54.450> here

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
area that is rubberized over here

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.200 
area that is rubberized over here
otherwise<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.689> really<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:58.200> slippery

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
otherwise it is really really slippery

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
otherwise it is really really slippery
I'm<00:02:00.210> at<00:02:00.479> risk<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:01.049> dropping<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.680> camera<00:02:02.189> all

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I'm at risk at dropping this camera all

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.630 
I'm at risk at dropping this camera all
the<00:02:02.399> time<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:04.049> third<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.280> Sony<00:02:05.759> rx100<00:02:06.509> case

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the time and third the Sony rx100 case

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.479 
the time and third the Sony rx100 case
this<00:02:08.640> case<00:02:08.940> wraps<00:02:09.539> around<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.890> camera<00:02:11.310> body

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
this case wraps around the camera body

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.690 
this case wraps around the camera body
and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.369 
and
helps<00:02:12.849> cushion<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.810> not<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.200> solid<00:02:14.739> camera<00:02:15.069> at

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
helps cushion the not so solid camera at

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.020 
helps cushion the not so solid camera at
potential<00:02:17.379> impact<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:20.560> also<00:02:20.769> adds<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.610> layer<00:02:21.970> of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
potential impact it also adds a layer of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.210 
potential impact it also adds a layer of
friction<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.760> camera<00:02:25.360> making<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.530> easier

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
friction to the camera making it easier

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.330 
friction to the camera making it easier
to<00:02:27.760> hold<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.690> part<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:32.170> detachable<00:02:32.980> so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to hold on to this part is detachable so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.870 
to hold on to this part is detachable so
you<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.760> use<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.420> lower<00:02:34.810> part<00:02:34.930> if<00:02:35.880> your

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you can use just the lower part if your

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.240 
you can use just the lower part if your
concern<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.680> know<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:39.190> lack<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.900> grip<00:02:41.250> or

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
concern is you know the lack of grip or

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.830 
concern is you know the lack of grip or
you<00:02:42.910> could<00:02:43.180> add<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.599> full<00:02:43.870> thing<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:45.840> of

you could add the full thing and of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.860 
you could add the full thing and of
course<00:02:47.370> once<00:02:48.370> attached<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:48.910> detach<00:02:49.540> this

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
course once attached you can detach this

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.550 
course once attached you can detach this
part<00:02:50.670> partially<00:02:51.670> right<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:53.019> hangs<00:02:53.290> like

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
part partially right and it hangs like

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.580

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
of the rx100 is falled then again then

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.930 
of the rx100 is falled then again then
again<00:04:13.209> isn't<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.870> what<00:04:14.109> Apple<00:04:14.470> does<00:04:14.709> you<00:04:15.669> buy

again isn't that what Apple does you buy
the<00:04:16.000> iPhone<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.900> then<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.139> have<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.440> get<00:04:17.620> a

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
the iPhone and then you have to get a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.729 
the iPhone and then you have to get a
case<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.430> some<00:04:19.239> kind<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.599> screen<00:04:19.959> protector

case and some kind of screen protector
and<00:04:21.070> all<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:22.599> maybe<00:04:22.930> we<00:04:23.169> can't<00:04:23.440> blame

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
and all that so maybe we can't blame

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.650 
and all that so maybe we can't blame
Sony<00:04:24.720> maybe<00:04:25.720> we<00:04:25.900> should

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
Sony maybe we should

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.960 
Sony maybe we should
the<00:04:28.660> only<00:04:29.260> other<00:04:29.500> thing<00:04:29.920> except<00:04:30.610> prize<00:04:30.910> and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the only other thing except prize and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.610 
the only other thing except prize and
the<00:04:33.970> fact<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.570> need<00:04:34.840> one<00:04:35.020> in<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.320> first

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
the fact that you need one in the first

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.810 
the fact that you need one in the first
place<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:37.570> adding<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.260> case<00:04:38.620> makes<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
place is that adding this case makes the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.380 
place is that adding this case makes the
camera<00:04:40.360> less<00:04:40.660> pocketable<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:42.430> suddenly<00:04:42.940> a

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
camera less pocketable it's suddenly a

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.240 
camera less pocketable it's suddenly a
lot<00:04:43.990> larger<00:04:45.450> maybe<00:04:46.620> that's<00:04:47.620> not<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.920> problem

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
lot larger maybe that's not a problem

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.710 
lot larger maybe that's not a problem
myself<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.540> keep<00:04:49.840> my<00:04:50.650> camera<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.730> rx100<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.450> care
