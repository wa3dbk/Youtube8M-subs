00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.859
 now how have we been working 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.320
 with the yarn of row you called 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.929
 I've already uploaded the video on how to weave 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.059
 this layer and in addition also the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 video of how to weave a rectangle and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 turn it into a multipurpose with this 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 same yarn we will continue working 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.480
 I'm going to show you how we can weave two 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 rectangles and put together different designs 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.029
 here are only ideas that I hope that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.029
 they are very useful 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.610
 I already have here the second rectangle 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.250
 tissue is completely equal to this the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.950
 same points all the same but the only 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.080
 difference for what you see let's say to 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.530
 this one looks a little bigger than this 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.230
 this I have not ironed here I am 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.430
 putting first this and then this 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 so that I stay as close to the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.210
 Same size 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.530
 the two rectangles because although it's the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.020
 same fabric yes at the time of us 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.940
 put steam on it may be that we have a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.940
 little bit a little bit bigger 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.310
 here I have ironed the two pieces 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.490
 that are practically leaving me 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 The same is important as I mentioned 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.220
 that they put first the one that they raised 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 first and on top of the other so they have a 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.259
 good reference and so at the time of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.929
 pass the steam they are the closest thing 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.580
 the tissue remember that the tissue if 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.500
 stretch 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.780
 He is grasping the way we will 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.240
 let's go giving and this I mean the width 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.010
 or along the stitch leave it 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.190
 cool and then we can work with 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.400
 the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.390
 and the other 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.390
 in the other side 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.980
 it has been the accommodation of the two 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890
 rectangles in this way we have 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.690
 many ways to make him out 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.460
 advantage these two rectangles of the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.160
 laces that we create we are going to 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.410
 use them to shape these two 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.310
 rectangles or we can use a ribbon 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.310
 or a lace 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.659
 and you can give class to the fall 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.659
 here that you want the one that d 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.040
 this I am putting him alone in the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.220
 part of above but you are going to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.660
 go through each of the holes 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.160
 because good is the advantage it has 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.080
 is targeted as it has so many 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.010
 holes we can use it as 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.010
 if it were a ready pass 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.440
 and this is where I'm going to put it 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:16.970
 the lace or the lace or the ribbon 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.880
 height that I'm giving here 1 2 3 4 well 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.910
 until you reach number 19 so in 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.100
 each of the sides I will put a 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.430
 Securit to indicate what is the return 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.650
 number 19 and with this make it easier 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.409
 when the bar passes 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.180
 in each of the parts that we have left 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.599
 under the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.659
 from the armpit we're going to leave a little square 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.730
 that is the last and the first 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:48.540
 start from the other side we're going to 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 splice to put one on top of the other 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.090
 and here we can stay the same 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.640
 line 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.640
 and then to have 2 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.070
 we passed one and then on top of the other 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.980
 we had it here 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.180
 and we continue to go through it 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.180
 return 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.050
 all right 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.880
 in this design basically what I did 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.220
 was to center the fabric on what was the 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.400
 neck from there give you the fall that I 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.080
 I would like and make a union as we are 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.910
 talking about the forward side and the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.130
 audio back are practically the same 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.889
 I do the divisions equally for the 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.440
 side of the front as the back and 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:48.250
 In this case, I put a little bow here 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.960
 with a piece of yarn but this is 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.300
 nothing more to show you this option 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.479
 here and what you could do is 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.099
 join either two or three laps with the 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.070
 part forward the back or 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.900
 even with just one and here already with that 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.180
 we have the union to generate what is 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.400
 the shoulder of the garment and in the part of 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.160
 here below we also have this 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.620
 blouse is only grabbed with a single 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.990
 point on the same lap that I had 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.789
 marked for the other design that was in 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.289
 the return number 19 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:22.809
 there is a width left for me 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.240
 the one that I need according to the size 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:28.809
 that I am here showing this size 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.649
 it would be medium or large size big and 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:35.740
 here in this design that were the 

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:40.210
 corners of the two pieces in the part 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:43.080
 of the shoulder that were dropped and opened in 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.080
 the part of here 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.070
 it also occurs to me that this option is 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.470
 very good nothing more with a single 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.050
 rectangle and I'm joining the part of 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.000
 here of the neck three turns nothing more 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.190
 well I put a stable there but it's 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.330
 to give you the idea and that from this side 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.750
 it's like doing here a wave with 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.750
 this fall 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.939
 here only one go of the shoulders very 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.939
 bit 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:22.789
 and on the sides 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.770
 join also in some points after 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.080
 to decide which is the design that most 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.090
 like then you have to proceed to do 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.310
 the final seams so that it is 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.259
 the design that you like the most if it is that 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.610
 so they wish otherwise they can 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:37.039
 also take advantage of what are the 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.410
 laces and well with that already they are left 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.880
 for several options thanks for being
