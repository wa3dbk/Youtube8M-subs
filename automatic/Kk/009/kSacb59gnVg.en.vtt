they're all beautiful it was really

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
they're all beautiful it was really
difficult<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.250> me<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.579> choose<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> case<00:00:36.120> for

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
difficult for me to choose a case for

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
difficult for me to choose a case for
myself<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.530> were<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.800> pretty

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
myself because they were all so pretty

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.520 
myself because they were all so pretty
and<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.360> could<00:00:39.510> even<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.050> name<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and you could even get your name on it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.740 
and you could even get your name on it
so<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.399> thought<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.270> pretty<00:00:42.480> cool

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so that's what I thought was pretty cool

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.479 
so that's what I thought was pretty cool
I<00:00:42.780> don't<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.200> any<00:00:43.379> cases<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.100> name<00:00:44.309> on

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
I don't have any cases with my name on

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.660 
I don't have any cases with my name on
it

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580 
besides this one now so let me show you
what<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.550> came<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.320> what

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
what it came with so first this is what

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.160 
what it came with so first this is what
the<00:00:49.710> actual<00:00:49.829> phone<00:00:50.280> case<00:00:50.550> came<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.050> am

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the actual phone case came in and I am

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.450 
the actual phone case came in and I am
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> show<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> case<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> second

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
going to show you the case in a second

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.910 
going to show you the case in a second
but<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> came<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
but this is what it came in it is a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.229 
but this is what it came in it is a
water-resistant<00:00:55.920> bag<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
water-resistant bag so I think this is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.729 
water-resistant bag so I think this is
very<00:00:57.270> convenient

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
very convenient

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.279 
very convenient
not<00:00:59.160> only<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.660> send<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> you

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
not only for them to like send it to you

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
not only for them to like send it to you
in<00:01:01.500> case<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> bag<00:01:02.460> rips<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> water<00:01:03.420> gets

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
in case like the bag rips and water gets

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
in case like the bag rips and water gets
on<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.040> live<00:01:05.309> around<00:01:05.580> water<00:01:06.150> or

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
on it but if you live around water or

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.640 
on it but if you live around water or
you<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> pool<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.170> anything<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you have a pool or anything like that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
you have a pool or anything like that
you<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.040> even<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.790> actual<00:01:09.119> phone<00:01:09.390> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
you could even put your actual phone in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
you could even put your actual phone in
here<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.369> don't<00:01:11.549> have

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here and take it with you you don't have

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
here and take it with you you don't have
to<00:01:11.729> worry<00:01:11.880> about<00:01:12.119> water<00:01:12.450> getting<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to worry about water getting on it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
to worry about water getting on it
especially<00:01:13.320> during<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> summer<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.490> you're

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
especially during the summer if you're

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
especially during the summer if you're
going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> beach<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> put<00:01:16.020> your

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

going to the beach you can put your
phone<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.680> while<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.130> using<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
phone in here while you're not using it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
phone in here while you're not using it
so<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.880> any<00:01:18.090> mist<00:01:18.420> gets<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.890> very
