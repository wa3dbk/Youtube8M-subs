interesting can you talk us through the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
interesting can you talk us through the
vapor<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.580> guess<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.300> bit<00:00:30.570> we'd

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
vapor I guess we're a little bit we'd

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.759 
vapor I guess we're a little bit we'd
like<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.590> bit

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
like to think we're a little bit

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.500 
like to think we're a little bit
different<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.759> don't<00:00:32.880> basically<00:00:33.329> make<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
different we we don't basically make a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
different we we don't basically make a
two-piece<00:00:33.960> shoe<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.290> make<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> one-piece<00:00:34.950> shoot

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
two-piece shoe we make a one-piece shoot

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.400 
two-piece shoe we make a one-piece shoot
we<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:36.210> build<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.540> their<00:00:36.690> shoes<00:00:36.899> inside<00:00:37.230> out

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
we we build all their shoes inside out

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
we we build all their shoes inside out
so<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.950> quite<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> unique<00:00:38.460> process<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
so it's quite a unique process it's a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.389 
so it's quite a unique process it's a
process<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.660> takes<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.140> longer<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.250> it's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
process that takes a lot longer and it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
process that takes a lot longer and it's
also<00:00:41.520> process<00:00:42.030> that's<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.540> 100%

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
also process that's actually 100%

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.260 
also process that's actually 100%
handmade<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> gives<00:00:44.550> us<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> product<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
handmade but it gives us the product and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.299 
handmade but it gives us the product and
a<00:00:45.300> technical<00:00:45.600> product<00:00:45.930> capabilities<00:00:46.680> through

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a technical product capabilities through

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.880 
a technical product capabilities through
example<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> achieve

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
example that we really want to achieve

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.250 
example that we really want to achieve
and<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> advantages<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and what are the advantages of of the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
and what are the advantages of of the
way<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:52.949> shoes<00:00:53.309> why<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.610> your

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
shoes special we we building technical

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.150 
shoes special we we building technical
features<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.199> example<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.649> allow<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> lot

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
features for example that allow a lot

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.590 
features for example that allow a lot
more<00:00:59.190> stability<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.059> creative<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
more stability to be creative for the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
more stability to be creative for the
shirt<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> foot<00:01:01.199> okay<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.000> unlike<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
shirt for the foot okay so unlike a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
shirt for the foot okay so unlike a
two-piece<00:01:03.510> shoe<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.930> example<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> soft

two-piece shoe for example with the soft

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.830 
two-piece shoe for example with the soft
sides<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> rounded<00:01:05.790> side<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.540> actually

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
sides on a rounded side we actually

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
sides on a rounded side we actually
build<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> support<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> carbon<00:01:08.310> base<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
build a support it to a carbon base you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
build a support it to a carbon base you
know<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> people<00:01:09.780> sort<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> out

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
know a lot of people sort of look it out

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
know a lot of people sort of look it out
basically<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.460> attempted<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
basically what they attempted to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
basically what they attempted to
classify<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.020> bathtub<00:01:13.439> shape<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> think

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
classify as a bathtub shape and think

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.200 
classify as a bathtub shape and think
I'll<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.880> strengths

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I'll you know we do it for strengths

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
I'll you know we do it for strengths
know<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.229> actually<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> we're

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
know what we actually do is we're

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440 
know what we actually do is we're
basically<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.369> creating<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> nice<00:01:18.119> stable

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
basically just creating a nice stable

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
basically just creating a nice stable
platform<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.200> allow<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> rider's<00:01:20.460> foot<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> be

struggling with trying to support itself

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
struggling with trying to support itself
around<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.640> place<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.140> shoe<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.320> help<00:01:28.740> we

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
around a place a shoe that help we

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
around a place a shoe that help we
should<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:29.100> power<00:01:29.490> down<00:01:29.759> much<00:01:30.210> more

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
should put more power down much more

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
should put more power down much more
efficient<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> lot<00:01:31.409> more<00:01:31.439> efficient

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.649 
efficient just a lot more efficient
we're<00:01:32.130> building<00:01:32.520> things<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.850> collateral

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
we're building things like collateral

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
we're building things like collateral
for<00:01:33.869> foot<00:01:34.049> support<00:01:34.229> basically<00:01:34.829> we've

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
for foot support basically we've

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
for foot support basically we've
stabilized<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.729> foot<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.450> plates

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
stabilized the foot over the plates

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
stabilized the foot over the plates
that's<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.350> shifting<00:01:37.829> over<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that's actually not shifting over the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
that's actually not shifting over the
plate<00:01:38.340> we're<00:01:39.150> building<00:01:39.450> things<00:01:39.600> like

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
plate we're building things like

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
plate we're building things like
structural<00:01:40.259> art<00:01:40.530> support<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.040> allows<00:01:41.280> even

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
structural art support that allows even

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
structural art support that allows even
your<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:42.060> better<00:01:42.329> end<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.750> sole<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
your your better end in a sole so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.569 
your your better end in a sole so
basically<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.740> an<00:01:43.829> anchor<00:01:44.130> point<00:01:44.369> so

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
basically have an anchor point so

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
basically have an anchor point so
they're<00:01:44.939> allowed<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> again<00:01:45.479> stabilizer<00:01:46.020> for

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
they're allowed to again stabilizer for

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
they're allowed to again stabilizer for
it<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.560> maintain<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> good<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> good

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it and maintain that good that the good

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
it and maintain that good that the good
traction<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> traction

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
traction in the traction

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
traction in the traction
we're<00:01:50.070> building<00:01:50.399> anatomical<00:01:51.000> heel<00:01:51.180> cups<00:01:51.420> we

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
we're building anatomical heel cups we

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
we're building anatomical heel cups we
actually<00:01:51.930> looked<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.259> took<00:01:52.380> 20,000<00:01:53.070> laser

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
actually looked we took 20,000 laser

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually looked we took 20,000 laser
scans<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> people's<00:01:54.090> feet<00:01:54.270> before<00:01:54.479> we

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
scans of people's feet before we

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.630 
scans of people's feet before we
designed<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> shoe<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.430> we've

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
designed the shoe so you know we've

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.060 
designed the shoe so you know we've
really<00:01:57.240> looked<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> anatomical<00:01:58.680> part<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really looked at the anatomical part of

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
really looked at the anatomical part of
the<00:01:59.159> part<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> foot<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.060> basically<00:02:00.630> how

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the part of the foot and basically how

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690 
the part of the foot and basically how
its<00:02:01.200> needs<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.680> shaped<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.430> capture

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
its needs to be shaped to really capture

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.209 
its needs to be shaped to really capture
that<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.540> heel<00:02:03.780> cup<00:02:03.810> without<00:02:04.409> using

it's basically a minimalist shoe it it
takes<00:03:43.140> all<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.560> design<00:03:44.040> attributes<00:03:44.310> of

the<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.269> vapor<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:46.109> we<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.290> basically

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
the of the vapor but we just basically

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.289 
the of the vapor but we just basically
build<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.579> little<00:03:47.760> bit<00:03:47.850> lighter<00:03:48.030> we

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
build it just a little bit lighter we

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.270 
build it just a little bit lighter we
put<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> few<00:03:48.660> different<00:03:49.019> materials<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.920> carbon

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
put a few different materials the carbon

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.710 
put a few different materials the carbon
layup<00:03:50.579> changes<00:03:50.970> underneath<00:03:51.299> all<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.510> this

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
layup changes underneath all of this

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.059 
layup changes underneath all of this
little<00:03:52.049> slightly<00:03:52.350> as<00:03:52.440> well<00:03:52.590> which<00:03:52.769> then

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
little slightly as well which then

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.039 
little slightly as well which then
reduces<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.640> way<00:03:53.790> instead<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.660> having<00:03:54.959> a

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
reduces the way instead of having a

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.300 
reduces the way instead of having a
ratchet<00:03:55.350> system<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.769> go<00:03:55.890> back<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
ratchet system we go back to a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.009 
ratchet system we go back to a
traditional<00:03:56.790> lace<00:03:56.970> system<00:03:57.329> which<00:03:57.420> then<00:03:57.750> cuts

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
traditional lace system which then cuts

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.960 
traditional lace system which then cuts
down<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.319> weight<00:03:58.470> as<00:03:58.620> well<00:03:58.799> has<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.760> glass

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
down the weight as well has the glass

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.819 
down the weight as well has the glass
upper<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.510> there<00:04:00.690> which<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.019> nice<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.650> sleek

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
upper on there which is nice and sleek

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.349 
upper on there which is nice and sleek
and<00:04:02.010> has<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.310> aerodynamic<00:04:02.850> front<00:04:03.060> cover<00:04:03.269> on

and has the aerodynamic front cover on

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.420 
and has the aerodynamic front cover on
there<00:04:03.600> as<00:04:03.750> well<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.530> that's<00:04:05.160> pretty<00:04:05.250> much

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
there as well that's that's pretty much

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.789 
there as well that's that's pretty much
it<00:04:05.670> apart<00:04:05.910> from<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.120> same<00:04:06.900> same<00:04:07.410> properties

that we have in the vapor are also in
the<00:04:10.139> zero

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
the zero

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.790
