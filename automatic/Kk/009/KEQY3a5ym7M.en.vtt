00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
itself and it's a very white neck so I
had<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> turn<00:01:32.939> down<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.240> exposure<00:01:33.540> levels<00:01:34.020> but

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
had to turn down the exposure levels but

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
had to turn down the exposure levels but
there<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.159> nice<00:01:35.369> hints<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
there are some really nice hints of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
there are some really nice hints of
orange<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:37.979> right

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
orange on it which you can see right

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160 
orange on it which you can see right
there<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:39.240> whole<00:01:39.420> part<00:01:39.630> swivels<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
there and this whole part swivels and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840 
there and this whole part swivels and
we'll<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> piece<00:01:40.950> over<00:01:41.189> later<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
we'll get to that piece over later and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.600 
we'll get to that piece over later and
there<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.259> here's<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.530> 360<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
there it is and then here's just 360 and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.380 
there it is and then here's just 360 and
there<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.799> translucent<00:01:46.850> white<00:01:47.850> piece<00:01:48.149> on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
there is a translucent white piece on

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
there is a translucent white piece on
the<00:01:48.509> bottom<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> guess<00:01:49.200> make<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> look<00:01:49.799> like

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the bottom I guess make it look like

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.700 
the bottom I guess make it look like
it's<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.250> levitating<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> top<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
it's like levitating and on the top I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's like levitating and on the top I
think<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> best<00:01:53.399> part<00:01:53.640> besides<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.329> cuz<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
think the best part besides is see cuz I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.050 
think the best part besides is see cuz I
really<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> seat<00:01:55.229> right<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.409> um

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
really like the seat right there um

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
really like the seat right there um
there<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.299> an<00:01:57.869> inverted<00:01:58.469> tile<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> think

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
there is an inverted tile and I think

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100 
there is an inverted tile and I think
this<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.640> awesome<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.299> Lego<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> include<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this was awesome to Lego to include this

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
this was awesome to Lego to include this
piece<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.100> fairly<00:02:02.340> new<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.909> mean<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
piece because it's fairly new I mean I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.380 
piece because it's fairly new I mean I
know<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> came<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.899> summer<00:02:04.110> 2012<00:02:05.030> sets<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
know it came out in summer 2012 sets and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.940 
know it came out in summer 2012 sets and
I<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> cheapest<00:02:07.649> way<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.770> get

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think this is the cheapest way to get

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.609 
I think this is the cheapest way to get
it<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.280> not

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
it because I'm not

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.640 
to come than any other poly bags it's
just<00:02:11.620> an<00:02:11.709> awesome<00:02:12.159> piece<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.989> yes<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.500> all
