00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.800
 in this tutorial I will show one of the techniques 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.160
 to adjust the color of an image 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.219
 using 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.699
 the most color 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.199
 from image 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.359
 darker color 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.089
 i the point I like the color more inside the image 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.169
 for this I am going to use 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.390
 of some tools that have photos or 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.069
 first of all 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.739
 in the adjustment palette that he knew for those who have the previous version of 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.890
 photoshop cs3 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.090
 a general 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.500
 layer panel 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 and select 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.450
 macapagal juste 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.580
 think 4 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.830
 active sampras with clicking here on the button 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.840
 I'm going to ballast the slider p 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.350
 totally to the right 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.330
 and then slowly to the left until they begin to appear 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.620
 white 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 on the screen 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.769
 those areas 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.510
 indicate 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.450
 the clearest point of the image 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.830
 can you help the layer moment 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.490
 we want you to effectively 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 I'm talking about the clearest areas of the year 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.360
 with the pen tool 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.950
 sorry with the tool 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 from botero 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.210
 Messi had on the image 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.310
 and I'm going to oppress 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.600
 and click on any of those areas 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 immediately a point is created 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.130
 with number one 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.320
 which is a point of example uneasiness 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.810
 I turn to monopolize 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.509
 to the settings panel and dragged totally to the left the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.910
 stylized 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.380
 and I repeat the same 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.390
 operation this time in the opposite direction 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.520
 the first areas that begin to appear are the darkest areas of 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.340
 the picture 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.750
 let's try 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.640
 I effectively is in the darkest area 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.210
 I press chips 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.210
 one click on that area 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.159
 temporarily I'm going to disable this layer of 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.079
 of adjustment d 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 I activate the lower layer 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.929
 in the lower layer 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.429
 above the lower layer I create a 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.809
 new 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.699
 I'm going to fill in gray 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.939
 for that he thought 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.759
 the backspace key 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.869
 and the kings box is activated 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.629
 selected from the options we have here 50% gray 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.429
 I say we have normal opacity 7% 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 i preserve transparency deactivates 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.279
 my gray color on another color 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.279
 and activated the difference mode 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.009
 the darkest areas of the image will be 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:10.109
 the gray areas in this case reached yesterday by 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.409
 screen that are 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.749
 these contours of the letter 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.699
 but to do it in a way 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.259
 more non-visual technique 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.749
 I can activate the adjustment layer again 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:24.989
 express 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.979
 and in the layer you like 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.539
 He dragged TV back to the 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.479
 left 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.449
 slowly to the right 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.499
 and the areas that appear 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.979
 in January they are telling me that this is the area 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.609
 gray of the image 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:43.710
 we fulfill chip 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.709
 and the click on any delay 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.549
 I already have on screen 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.879
 on the image 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.839
 three points 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.839
 the whitest point the blackest point e 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.389
 for now 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.519
 then I will be clear these two capos 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.529
 I'm going to create a new adjustment layer 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.159
 of curves 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.989
 the left side I have three collations 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.299
 nico tero 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.309
 now conseller 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.209
 the pri to select the blackest point 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.909
 Cotero to select a more neutral point 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.909
 Butt to select 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.020
 there is no double click on him cotero 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.030
 i this is very important i have to establish which 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.069
 and maximum point 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.939
 of blacks that endure 30 min 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.849
 as usual 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.479
 the values ​​so much 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.569
 it must be that a cousin 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.629
 p number five 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.800
 in the brightness box 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.889
 swim some values ​​that are usually the most 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.889
 tight aon impression is exempted yeca 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.300
 but you can check with your thickness what this should be when 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.930
 this is going to be 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.639
 vekic about what there is 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.210
 then observe that it tells me that if these new values ​​are going to be left because 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.099
 I had to say yes 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.159
 new 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.159
 I establish what the white dot will be 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.160
 of the Guadalupan image is the minimum point values 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:21.889
 for printing 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.889
 double click on the white goalkeeper 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.900
 in brightness 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.069
 I write simply 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.039
 90 or 95 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.309
 they have given me some values 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:37.210
 minimum for April 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.419
 minimum for the white point 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.180
 ask your income what is the minimum point and whites what 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.529
 percentages of color to see in a white point 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.919
 lekic about what there is 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.620
 again the question 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.509
 that if those values ​​are going to give 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.770
 remain by default I say yes 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.020
 and here comes the part 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.559
 magical of all this 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.419
 I clicked on black cotero and I place myself in the darkest point of my 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:05.849
 mother 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.469
 cilic lic 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.969
 select white botero and I stopped over 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.289
 tomás blanco image 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.449
 iu explains 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.119
 select gray cotero 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.970
 click on the point 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.970
 more within it 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.499
 it fits 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.499
 let's see 1 before 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.339
 this probably is not 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:37.239
 a contrast that they have to make in their image but at least that is a good 

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:37.439
 Start
