00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.019
 it would be much better 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.149
 but it does not matter to me but I think it's 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.149
 my turn to nail 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.520
 but I still believe that the painting 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.520
 I would see much better 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.730
 where maybe here in the social center 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.730
 have the shade or support or do not hold 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.080

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.460
 help decorate good idea let's see 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.460
 if we find ourselves keeping both 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 decorating 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 the mornings when you call someone 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.939
 sense that you can use with wallpaper 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 new needed the average of the walls 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.460
 to know how much paper they needed and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.049
 animes key the glue for the paper 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.049
 a lot with and glue the wallpaper 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.149
 I need more foundation here you have 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.410
 you are a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:12.270
 is supposed to go on this side will be seen 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.000
 the lolas if they are against the world 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.660
 I guess it did not occur to me 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.830
 for carmelo a lot I throw that piece of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.830
 wallpaper in the trash 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.280
 ready to start truth and I also 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 if you're thinking what I would win I think 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.120
 it's time to throw 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.980
 but beware 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.340
 totally on the floor 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.569
 do not worry 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.239
 at this time 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.900
 what a mess we all have one piece 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.390
 of wallpaper I do not think it's 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.690
 enough to cover the wall these 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.690
 things 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.629
 I think we need 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.879
 3 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.880
 how are the thousands of this disorder not 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.930
 you worry, it would help you clean the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.630
 recording to not dream while 2 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.220
 bananas a lot since they cleaned and a 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.180
 I was cutting the paper flowers 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.180
 remaining tapestry 

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:44.429
 things 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.370
 ah 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.370
 it's a pity we can not decorate more 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.390
 but many hands 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.540
 enough to purge all the 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.540
 room 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.210
 but we can leave them on the table helps 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.210
 yours 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:23.340
 are you thinking what I think if I do not 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:23.340
 that's how the flowers arrived
