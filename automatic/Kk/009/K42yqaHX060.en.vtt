00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.560
 very good everyone do the micro here 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.939
 you have another double combat combat in 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.349
 this occasion and the truth is that it is one 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.730
 of the ones that made me sweat the most 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.890
 doubt you will see right away it has been a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.930
 very close fight until the end but 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.360
 when you see the rival team many already 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.919
 intuit is because there you have it and good 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.860
 the pokemon that I have not used in the 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.379
 paras and a camper if I remember correctly 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.590
 because I say it has been very very very 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.840
 disputed good as you know 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.650
 there was a combo mounted and I said there was 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.300
 because now he explained it right away 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.070
 as you know polito can carry the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 drizzle skill of dreamworks and there's 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.340
 few who have the ability to swim 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.780
 fast bending at speed in a 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.060
 rainy weather as it may be that indra 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.790
 jordi color then many pokemon like 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.870
 want for example they shot him with that 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.300
 ability is to say that Indra is 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.180
 banned with the ability to swim fast and 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.270
 a little although it has drizzle then 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.100
 seeing his team supposed that we are going to those 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.230
 rules had gone through the lining and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 that's because they brought me nothing fast 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.970
 but well I did not have it insured either 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.770
 because the truth is that he knows a lot in 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.140
 this team the work is also not used 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.640
 in excess and good they go persie that is 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.040
 used in your life although little by little 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.330
 they have been leaving a little aside like this 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.820
 Well, there you see my team, both of whom 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.220
 left out they are hackers because good of 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.690
 an attack of ice and both read well 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.340
 both money and dragon type also 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.979
 on the part of that Indra was going to the ground 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.380
 sure and knowing that they were going to go with 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.610
 fast I could not risk it and well he goes 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.800
 putting did not help me much in this 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.170
 combat being the majority of the pokemon of the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.110
 water type rival team so good 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.030
 I started with start me for trying 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.260
 put a lightning bolt at the beginning in case it sounded 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.150
 the flute and 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.530
 faster than the opponent because good 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.110
 what double the speed the icons that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.430
 be a little too fast and good with faith 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.510
 reason also to start holding the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.910
 kind from the beginning start with 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.730
 paralysis trap rocks and with attacks of 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.610
 type plant because certainly the pokemon 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.750
 what else was going to help me in this fight 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.450
 so well as you see I also left a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.010
 little to be my important to if 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.350
 I really carried the skill I swam 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.170
 fast and as you see attacked before so 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.610
 obviously it has swum as fast 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.980
 see the fight does not start very well as 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.930
 well for me but good here with 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.480
 ferro fernando with 1 meter could not 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.290
 open so he said it too but good 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.570
 will decide for Paul and top because really 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.780
 as soon as attacks and power attack will be 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.940
 more dangerous because ludic is a 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.010
 little more pulling defensive and then 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.260
 I preferred to paralyze 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.090
 to polito to remove it from the middle before 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.010
 but we see that there is a change for salt and 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.239
 they are here good from armani so follow 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.439
 being the king on the track if he is no more 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.180
 fast even though they have the ability 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.150
 fast swim from armani so has 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 a lot of police thanks to the handkerchief 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.629
 so it turned community that he has 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.250
 left quite touched me touch adviser 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.959
 in the field we see that she is the only wolf with 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.569
 a scald that under the rain the truth 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.819
 it's pretty hard but good 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.019
 got lucky and we go to what he has 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.659
 missed here as I would have burned already 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.099
 it would have been the icing on the cake here 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.049
 with ferraz getting thunder waves 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.049
 I'm very interested in paralyzing everything 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.030
 your team for the dreamworks skill 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.530
 he said to him I do not I have no'm not 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.239
 sure if this the rhythm of the computer 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.760
 fast the one of polytonies and that sure that 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.370
 it is from the ring world that of drizzle but 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.480
 nothing fast I'm not sure team does not 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.909
 we have seen is a sensor that goes with a 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.069
 sting very hard thanks to the gem 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.139
 said has taken us a little bit more from 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.269
 half of good life a little bit more 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.129
 one more ps has taken us practically 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.540
 half of life and here with six 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.069
 shorts knowing that if faster because 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.720
 they are paralyzed took the opportunity to finish 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.700
 to be unique logo and return unit 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.410
 to put the little sister back and 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.730
 be able to choose an attack again 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.040
 although the truth is that I was quite 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.420
 with the tie eggs as usual 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.850
 say because right now the fight does not 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.880
 it painted very well for me it was pretty 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.040
 against the ropes was still missing a 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.380
 his pokÃ©mon for appearing in the field and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.360
 I did not know who I was although I was afraid that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.090
 out here come in because it 's more beast 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.680
 of the team here their ads go with a 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.840
 air shot that I do not understand very well not 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.210
 it's an attack that usually takes a lot but 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.490
 well if it works that he remedied 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.470
 will know what he does here good with faith 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.900
 reason as you see tried to hold the type 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.299
 in the best possible way, curing me 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.950
 drained hours and others as you see here 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.570
 effectively his last a little coin 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.950
 will have any you have seen that all 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.290
 because as they are they are saint and 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.180
 obviously they are created with little is 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.010
 here who records with a water attack 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.660
 It was quite obvious that life was going 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.800
 Manitene is going to knock down what he could not do 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.450
 a change they have only because 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.920
 would have killed uselessly and in the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.450
 next turn would have remained 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.000
 faster than the little sister because 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.320
 will have not been done yet now 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.940
 As you can see, I just launched a data 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.570
 well so now practically 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.070
 and his equipment is disabled but yes that 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.510
 I will go little by little trying 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.770
 control the situation within the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.060
 that fits because right now there was the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.610
 total despair as you see faith-reason 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.380
 is holding as well you can 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.160
 is holding the kind of the best 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.040
 possible way 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.830
 I'm definitely going to butt with drained now 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.660
 yes and waves thunder especially for to 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.850
 force the opponent's paralysis and heal me 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.770
 all the life that I can and here this 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.330
 moment to play with sensor because 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.950
 good as you see has tried to take out 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.300
 first yours but it was paralysis 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.560
 luckily we have some luck 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.430
 had combat because if it had not already 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.450
 been too much since you are using 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.190
 time as they are prohibited good 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.900
 Well, at least some luck we have 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.100
 to have good what the hell I was wearing 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.510
 for realized from the beginning of 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.400
 combat was practically a moment 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.320
 He should have skipped going was already 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.060
 matter of time they jump and also 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.950
 a little extends over good brain by 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.180
 at least it has also jumped to chimera 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.550
 As you can see, it has been quite a turn 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.320
 good for me and good as you see with six 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.330
 hurt with a chase because good 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.860
 still can not learn brute force 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.020
 in case you have it, surely 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.570
 gone with a silver and with persecution 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.840
 also good because if it says it already changes 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.449
 from indra 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.520
 it was quite not entirely safe but 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.580
 good in case I decided to do it to not 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.400
 play and make sure I get out of the way 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.870
 he is already forced to use persecutions 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.280
 our combat is not very effective against 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.110
 saiz in some cases there is about is already 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.389
 dead as you see the life he has left and 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.099
 active trainers and confidence as 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.319
 you have followed with traps rocks on 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.729
 all knowing that on this tour he does not know 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.039
 if you are going to die well by swimmers or 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.439
 good for the ability to touch us 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.150
 physically and I have decided to put the 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.969
 trap rocks to do him some damage 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.780
 of polito and here you have the last turn 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.400
 of combat as you see polito del conosur 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.449
 it is clear that he is dead because there 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.430
 rain in the field and you have left very 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.680
 little life but fierce are as you have 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.650
 endured like a champion and now of a 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.969
 relative whip does not talk whip very 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.340
 easy whip strain I do not know why it's in 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.919
 end of a whiplash is eppolito 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.180
 obviously it goes to the ground so 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.500
 well here you have the combat and the truth 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.479
 is that you know ife they have been 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.610
 portados a champions has endured very 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.529
 but very well we are few that every day 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.569
 I like to use more and I'm very 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.210
 taste with the team full so 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.789
 well let's hope they measure up 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.680
 in the tournament as of this Thursday not 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.449
 I know if I play Friday but hey I'm 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.740
 sure they will give very good 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.050
 results as they are giving so far 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.550
 so nothing guys here you have another
