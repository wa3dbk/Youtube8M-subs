time<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:36.490> about<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.789> then<00:01:37.210> we're<00:01:37.390> going

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
time so that's about it then we're going

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.940 
time so that's about it then we're going
to<00:01:37.539> go<00:01:37.690> around<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.050> edges<00:01:38.200> with<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.560> towel

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.889 
to go around the edges with the towel
just<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.940> make<00:01:40.060> sure<00:01:40.090> it's<00:01:40.420> nice<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.630> secure

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.630 
just to make sure it's nice and secure
but<00:01:41.320> it's<00:01:41.470> much<00:01:41.619> easier<00:01:42.009> when<00:01:42.160> you<00:01:42.280> have<00:01:42.429> two

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
