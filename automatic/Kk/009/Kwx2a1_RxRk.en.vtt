Drive if you have a C Drive you can set

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.100 
Drive if you have a C Drive you can set
this<00:02:25.700> one<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.120> these<00:02:26.240> two<00:02:26.420> tabs<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.930> C

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
this one of these two tabs to the C

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.480 
this one of these two tabs to the C
Drive<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.620> then<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:27.920> way<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.100> just<00:02:28.220> go<00:02:28.430> to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
Drive and then that way you just go to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.100 
Drive and then that way you just go to
metro<00:02:28.730> commander<00:02:29.270> if<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.450> want<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.720> find<00:02:29.900> like

a photo that's hidden in it do anything
you<00:02:32.750> basically<00:02:33.440> want<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.100> then<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.280> can

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
you basically want to and then you can

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.050 
you basically want to and then you can
go<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.640> root<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:36.680> sets<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.070> root<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.970> as

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
go to root and it sets it to root so as

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.480 
go to root and it sets it to root so as
you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.300> see<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.570> C<00:02:38.720> Drive<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.320> root<00:02:39.560> is

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
you can see the C Drive is the root is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.490 
you can see the C Drive is the root is
the<00:02:40.670> root<00:02:40.850> folder<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:42.260> do<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.470> same

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the root folder you can do the same

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.470 
the root folder you can do the same
thing<00:02:42.860> on<00:02:43.070> both<00:02:43.100> sides<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:43.820> both<00:02:44.210> of<00:02:44.240> these

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
thing on both sides so both of these

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.990 
thing on both sides so both of these
this<00:02:44.840> side<00:02:45.470> applies<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.310> side<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.940> this

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
this side applies to this side and this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.720 
this side applies to this side and this
side<00:02:47.180> applies<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.080> side<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
side applies to this side so it's the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.240 
side applies to this side so it's the
same<00:02:49.970> thing<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.510> also<00:02:50.780> say<00:02:51.260> if<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.650> click<00:02:51.920> into

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
same thing and also say if I click into

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.840 
same thing and also say if I click into
Intel<00:02:53.590> if<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.950> want<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> go<00:02:55.280> back<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.700> goes<00:02:55.790> back

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
Intel if I want to go back it goes back

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.910 
Intel if I want to go back it goes back
yeah<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:56.750> pretty<00:02:56.989> straightforward<00:02:57.350> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
yeah it's pretty straightforward and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.620 
yeah it's pretty straightforward and
again<00:02:58.220> if<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.430> press<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.120> goes<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.510> your

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
again if you press this it goes to your

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.940 
again if you press this it goes to your
computers<00:03:00.140> files<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:01.100> way<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.700> view

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
computers files that way you can view

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.590 
computers files that way you can view
which<00:03:03.950> folder<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.459> want<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.730> select<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.450> be

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
your SkyDrive files in this environment

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.509 
your SkyDrive files in this environment
back<00:03:19.670> forward<00:03:20.060> does<00:03:20.390> exactly<00:03:20.720> what<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.080> says

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
back forward does exactly what it says

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.310 
back forward does exactly what it says
route<00:03:22.519> route<00:03:23.090> goes<00:03:23.330> back<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.780> main<00:03:23.989> folder

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
route route goes back to the main folder

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.360 
route route goes back to the main folder
and<00:03:24.940> parent<00:03:25.940> parent<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.110> just<00:03:27.890> goes<00:03:28.040> back<00:03:28.250> to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and parent parent I just goes back to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.150 
and parent parent I just goes back to
the<00:03:28.459> parent<00:03:28.730> folder<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:30.739> we<00:03:30.890> went<00:03:31.040> to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
the parent folder so if we went to

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160 
the parent folder so if we went to
program<00:03:31.610> files

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
program files

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.920 
program files
and<00:03:34.010> then<00:03:34.190> we<00:03:34.280> hit<00:03:34.370> parent<00:03:34.819> parent<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.900> parent

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
and then we hit parent parent the parent

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.330 
and then we hit parent parent the parent
folder<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.920> folder<00:03:37.250> directly<00:03:37.880> under<00:03:38.330> a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
folder is the folder directly under a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.630 
folder is the folder directly under a
disk<00:03:40.340> folder<00:03:40.520> so<00:03:40.910> if<00:03:41.030> we<00:03:41.209> went<00:03:41.420> program<00:03:41.989> files

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
disk folder so if we went program files

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.880 
disk folder so if we went program files
adobe<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:44.569> parent<00:03:44.930> folder<00:03:45.080> would<00:03:45.410> be<00:03:45.530> program

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
adobe the parent folder would be program

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.949 
adobe the parent folder would be program
files<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.670> we'd<00:03:46.790> go<00:03:46.940> back<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.300> program<00:03:47.660> files

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
files so we'd go back to program files

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.440 
files so we'd go back to program files
as<00:03:48.230> e<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.380> see<00:03:48.770> so<00:03:49.459> there's<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.819> little<00:03:49.910> vocab

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
as e to see so there's a little vocab

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.920 
as e to see so there's a little vocab
that<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.810> learned<00:03:51.020> today<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.270> general<00:03:53.450> a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that you learned today but in general a

folder<00:04:43.550> for<00:04:43.880> riot<00:04:44.479> game<00:04:44.750> would<00:04:45.200> leak<00:04:45.350> for

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
folder for riot game would leak for

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.650 
folder for riot game would leak for
League<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.250> Legends<00:04:46.669> would<00:04:46.820> be<00:04:46.940> Riot<00:04:47.150> Games<00:04:47.270> so

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
League of Legends would be Riot Games so

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.600 
League of Legends would be Riot Games so
you<00:04:47.780> press<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.650> would<00:04:48.740> go<00:04:48.860> back<00:04:49.070> but

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
you press that and it would go back but

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.020 
you press that and it would go back but
apparently<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:50.450> just<00:04:50.780> realized<00:04:51.229> that<00:04:52.030> the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
apparently I just realized that the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.529 
apparently I just realized that the
parent<00:04:53.600> folder<00:04:54.430> only<00:04:55.430> applies<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:56.150> folder

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
parent folder only applies to the folder

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.060 
parent folder only applies to the folder
that<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.720> set<00:04:57.200> here<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:58.640> if<00:04:58.910> i<00:04:59.120> set<00:04:59.600> if<00:05:00.590> i<00:05:00.800> click

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
that you set here so if i set if i click

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
that you set here so if i set if i click
on<00:05:01.220> config

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
on config

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.720 
on config
and<00:05:03.830> actually<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:04.980> know<00:05:05.100> that's<00:05:05.310> not<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.490> very

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
and actually you know that's not a very

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.730 
and actually you know that's not a very
good<00:05:05.850> example<00:05:06.030> if<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.960> click<00:05:06.990> on<00:05:07.350> say<00:05:08.340> logs<00:05:09.740> and

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
good example if I click on say logs and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.290 
good example if I click on say logs and
i<00:05:10.830> click<00:05:11.070> on<00:05:11.220> already<00:05:11.970> I've<00:05:12.270> read<00:05:12.750> or<00:05:13.110> are<00:05:13.590> 3d

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
i click on already I've read or are 3d

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.140 
i click on already I've read or are 3d
and<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.900> hit<00:05:16.110> parent<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:17.220> just<00:05:17.460> goes<00:05:17.610> back<00:05:17.820> one

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
and I hit parent it just goes back one

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.450 
and I hit parent it just goes back one
and<00:05:18.479> then<00:05:19.169> parent<00:05:19.500> again<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.830> goes<00:05:19.919> back<00:05:19.979> one

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
and then parent again it goes back one

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.370 
and then parent again it goes back one
and<00:05:20.729> then<00:05:20.910> this<00:05:21.389> is<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.660> main<00:05:21.840> folder<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.350> I

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
and then this is the main folder that I

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.930 
and then this is the main folder that I
set<00:05:22.710> as<00:05:22.889> you<00:05:23.010> can<00:05:23.130> see<00:05:23.250> if<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.400> had<00:05:23.520> parent<00:05:23.850> again

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
set as you can see if I had parent again

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.120 
set as you can see if I had parent again
it<00:05:24.240> won't<00:05:24.389> go<00:05:24.510> back<00:05:24.690> anymore<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.830> only<00:05:25.919> goes

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
it won't go back anymore so it only goes

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.129 
it won't go back anymore so it only goes
back<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.610> first<00:05:26.820> they<00:05:27.030> can<00:05:27.180> go<00:05:27.300> back<00:05:27.510> is<00:05:27.780> a

back the first they can go back is a

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.400 
back the first they can go back is a
