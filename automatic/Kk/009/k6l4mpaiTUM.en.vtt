 here is the confiscated motor confiscated from 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.650
 network wisdom honestly earned 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.960
 items let's see 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.040
 I understand this is the alley of some glorious houses 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.350

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.410
 we have seen such an arena somewhere 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.160

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
