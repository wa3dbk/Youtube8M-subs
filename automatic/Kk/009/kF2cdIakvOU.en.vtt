okay<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.380> segment<00:00:01.560> we're<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:01.949> to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
okay in this segment we're going to

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.809 
okay in this segment we're going to
cover<00:00:02.159> drain<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.730> radiator

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:04.819 
cover drain the radiator

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.889 
cover drain the radiator
prior<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.850> draining<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.330> coolant<00:00:06.359> out<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
prior to draining the coolant out the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.600 
prior to draining the coolant out the
first<00:00:07.109> thing<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.379> need<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.130> remove<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
first thing we need to do is remove the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.950 
first thing we need to do is remove the
cap<00:00:09.260> if<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> system<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.889> under<00:00:11.010> pressure<00:00:11.960> when

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
cap if the system is under pressure when

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.600 
cap if the system is under pressure when
you<00:00:13.080> push<00:00:13.320> down<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.799> cap<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.219> release<00:00:14.429> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
you push down on this cap to release it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.010 
you push down on this cap to release it
in<00:00:14.670> order<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.910> turn<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> cap<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.630> got<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> lock

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
in order to turn the cap it's got a lock

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.570 
in order to turn the cap it's got a lock
system<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.830> push<00:00:17.100> down<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
system on it you have to push down and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
system on it you have to push down and
twist<00:00:17.840> simultaneously<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.410> push<00:00:19.619> down

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
twist simultaneously when you push down

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.359 
twist simultaneously when you push down
if<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.699> hear<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> venting<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.600> pressure<00:00:22.369> when

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
if you hear a venting of pressure when

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
if you hear a venting of pressure when
you<00:00:23.460> push<00:00:23.699> down<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.630> means<00:00:24.840> your<00:00:24.990> system

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you push down that means your system

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.080 
you push down that means your system
still<00:00:25.590> under<00:00:25.769> pressure<00:00:25.949> hold<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.580> down<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:27.060> a

for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> same<00:01:06.780> situation<00:01:07.439> you're<00:01:07.560> looking

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
for the same situation you're looking

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
for the same situation you're looking
for<00:01:08.040> dry<00:01:08.250> rock<00:01:08.490> crack<00:01:08.850> splits<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.659> any<00:01:10.200> damage

for dry rock crack splits or any damage

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.020 
for dry rock crack splits or any damage
that<00:01:10.680> would<00:01:10.890> prevent<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.340> sealing<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that would prevent it from sealing and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.240 
that would prevent it from sealing and
then<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> squeeze<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> spring<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
then you squeeze in on the spring and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.149 
then you squeeze in on the spring and
see<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.290> diaphragm<00:01:16.290> assembly<00:01:16.439> moves<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
see it's a diaphragm assembly moves in

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
see it's a diaphragm assembly moves in
everything<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> tell<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
everything that's not going to tell you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
everything that's not going to tell you
as<00:01:19.020> building<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> pressure<00:01:20.159> correctly<00:01:20.700> but

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
as building the pressure correctly but

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.390 
as building the pressure correctly but
it'll<00:01:21.000> tell<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> moving<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.400> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
it'll tell you that it is moving and if

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 
it'll tell you that it is moving and if
anything<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.270> doesn't<00:01:24.630> work<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.990> directed

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
anything there doesn't work as directed

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.289 
anything there doesn't work as directed
then<00:01:26.100> that'll<00:01:26.430> indicate<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> need<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
then that'll indicate that you need to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.999 
then that'll indicate that you need to
replace<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.630> cap<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:28.890> idea

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
replace your cap it's a good idea

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.890 
replace your cap it's a good idea
replace<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> cap<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.180> replacing<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
replace the cap with replacing a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.569 
replace the cap with replacing a
radiator<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.070> preventive

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
radiator it's a good preventive

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.440 
radiator it's a good preventive
maintenance<00:01:34.220> now<00:01:35.220> we've<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> cap<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.270> we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
maintenance now we've got the cap off we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.530 
maintenance now we've got the cap off we
want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> place<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> drain<00:01:37.229> pan<00:01:38.150> underneath<00:01:39.150> on

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
want to place a drain pan underneath on
