00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
of wet but the point we make is a whole

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.160

of<00:00:28.380> traditional<00:00:28.830> white<00:00:29.429> wedding<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.300> one

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of traditional white wedding we have one

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030 
of traditional white wedding we have one
or<00:00:30.660> two<00:00:30.810> riders<00:00:31.080> who<00:00:31.380> would<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> have

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
or two riders who would like to have

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.950 
or two riders who would like to have
white<00:00:32.340> wet<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:33.120> make<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.750> bit

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
white wet so I also make a little bit

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
white wet so I also make a little bit
but<00:00:34.260> most<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.649> them<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.040> eat<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> whole

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
but most of them they eat the whole

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
but most of them they eat the whole
grain<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.780> works<00:00:37.079> slower<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
grain because it works slower in the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.100 
grain because it works slower in the
body<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.640> more<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.719> better<00:00:39.899> for

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
body and it's more it's just better for

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.330 
body and it's more it's just better for
the<00:00:40.200> body<00:00:40.350> sorry<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.250> gonna

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the body sorry so it's how you gonna

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910 
the body sorry so it's how you gonna
make<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.410> yeast

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
make it first of all we have some yeast
and<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> organic<00:00:44.879> fresh<00:00:45.239> yeast<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and this is organic fresh yeast you can

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.459 
and this is organic fresh yeast you can
put<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> use<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> also<00:00:47.910> dry<00:00:48.390> yeast<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
put you can use a also dry yeast but the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
put you can use a also dry yeast but the
fresh<00:00:49.710> yeast<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.160> working<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.390> bit

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
fresh yeast is working a little bit

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
fresh yeast is working a little bit
quicker<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.280> bit<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.670> would

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
quicker and it's a little bit I would

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590 
quicker and it's a little bit I would
say<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.480> acid<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.860> 42<00:00:56.399> grams<00:00:56.670> in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
say more acid here there is 42 grams in

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.130 
say more acid here there is 42 grams in
here<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.789> 700<00:00:59.789> milliliters<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.390> half

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

these is already smell that's that it's
an<00:01:21.780> active<00:01:22.140> ingredient<00:01:22.380> yeah<00:01:23.130> sure

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
an active ingredient yeah sure

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
an active ingredient yeah sure
what<00:01:24.600> does<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> East<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.650> it's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
what does the East actually do it's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.300 
what does the East actually do it's
helping<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.180> waste<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.229> bread<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
helping a to waste of the bread and of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.179 
helping a to waste of the bread and of
course<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.110> only<00:01:31.290> white<00:01:31.560> wet<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
course if this was only white wet I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910 
course if this was only white wet I
would<00:01:32.640> maybe<00:01:33.119> only<00:01:33.479> use<00:01:33.630> 25<00:01:34.170> grams<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.710> yeast

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
would maybe only use 25 grams of yeast

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.700 
would maybe only use 25 grams of yeast
but<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> cost<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.030> flour<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:36.840> heavy<00:01:37.380> more

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
but the cost of flour is more heavy more

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.069 
but the cost of flour is more heavy more
compact<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.310> put<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> little<00:01:39.180> bit<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.420> years<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
compact I put a little bit more years to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.859 
compact I put a little bit more years to
help<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> bread<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.579> mix<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.840> with

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
help the bread so you mix that in with

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.969 
help the bread so you mix that in with
the<00:01:43.020> Eastern<00:01:43.500> air<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.409> you're<00:01:46.560> putting<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the Eastern air so on you're putting in

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.230 
the Eastern air so on you're putting in

and then we go to then darling small but
we<00:06:07.320> would<00:06:07.500> bake<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:07.860> for<00:06:08.010> 1214<00:06:08.789> minutes<00:06:09.030> yep
