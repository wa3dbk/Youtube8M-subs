00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:11.700
 so hello to unboxing from samsung galaxy 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 note 10.1 I have this great tippelt 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.680
 so now for our great side gamers 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.270
 get android 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.130
 Sponsor for the review of bats de want 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 we look at the good part and me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 must confess it is my first 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.529
 I 've killed something 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.860
 have already removed several plastic parts 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.809
 from the device and have only now times 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.719
 obligatory this great 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.719
 transport protection foil attached to the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.149
 few details reflect for example 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 Of course you can tell that that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.170
 device has this pen pen and a 1 4 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 ghz quad core processor 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.940
 but that's not the best thing 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 Personally, I am very excited about it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.000
 then you can do two gigabytes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.380
 then really a lot of multi tasking 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.850
 make and also for 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.110
 high resolution games and not movies 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.119
 Badly add so much memory 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.330
 have now so we see ever 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.400
 the startup screen 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 The device has 16 GB of internal memory 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.860
 but can via micro sd card slot 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 to be extended 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.009
 another nice feature is one 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.579
 smart remote so you can diverse 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.869
 devices hifi systems or even at the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.409
 control 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.740
 that's pretty nice looking 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.670
 you as one gets from all sides to 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.670
 it is relatively flat 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.190
 so from the side you can see now 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.350
 nothing at all and also here 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.710
 one only the connection where one then than 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.190
 micro usb can lower 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.080
 and yes , that's just as empty 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.070
 There are a few up here 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.470
 connections 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.600
 For example, we would have the sim 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.470
 card slot a push because this is here 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.990
 the 3g version is an infrared port 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.460
 here 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.150
 and then we also have a micro 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.350
 SD card slot for memory cards 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.300
 Then there is the one attack here 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.940
 button and the volume rocker and 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.459
 Of course here for music fans there 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.560
 of course the headphones connection 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:35.090
 what else do we have speakers 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.110
 we have great stereo left and right 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.910
 speakers and front are natural 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.459
 the obligatory brightness sensor 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.200
 and the front camera behind is there 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.790
 Of course, a camera too 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.970
 list this has five megapixels and 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 was 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.500
 who likes with a tray 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.459
 snapshots may want to do this 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:06.080
 then do so so far so i am 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.709
 actually quite pleased with the first 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.390
 Press the device with it we will 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.090
 also determines interesting things 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.860
 So for example, what does that have? 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.030
 now gets really performance-related 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.680
 on the hood 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.630
 we can do that in various ways 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.690
 benchmarks still determine or even 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.610
 of course in games and of course how 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.030
 the beats her in everyday life the great 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.690
 tablet that you then learn in the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.580
 next days with us we wanted you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.290
 a little more on the accessories 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.430
 point out here we have one 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.430
 great quick start guide 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.290
 and here we have what is that 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.370
 charging the device completely 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:59.530
 two-piece part plug and another one 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.500
 further guarantee snacks and we have 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.530
 we have the obligatory usb connection 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:12.280
 for data transfer and of course for 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 in lahnstein headphones are still in 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.620
 may not have held white 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.610
 so good to the device but that does too 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.630
 nothing like that and still some small parts where 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:29.370
 still flying around in the box 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.170
 that would be the whole hurry hurry 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.640
 There is more then as I said next 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.640
