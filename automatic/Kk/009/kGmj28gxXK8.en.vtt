00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.220 
thing to do to keep the curl
I<00:02:25.610> just<00:02:26.610> braid<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:28.020> not

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
I just braid it just like this I'm not

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.210 
I just braid it just like this I'm not
trying<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.650> cute

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
trying to be cute

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.880 
trying to be cute
I<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.760> braid<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.780> know<00:02:31.230> when<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
I just braid it so I know when I go to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.309 
I just braid it so I know when I go to
sleep<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.400> night<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:33.330> least<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.900> part<00:02:34.200> would

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
sleep at night at least this part would

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.920 
sleep at night at least this part would
be<00:02:34.379> decent<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.819> marine<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.780> really

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
be decent for the marine but it's really

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.790 
be decent for the marine but it's really
easy<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:38.040> already<00:02:38.430> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.760> curly<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.800> that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
easy it's already kind of curly so that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.160 
easy it's already kind of curly so that
really<00:02:40.920> helps<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.629> braiding<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.440> this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
really helps so braiding it like this

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.920 
really helps so braiding it like this
here<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:48.120> think<00:02:48.360> member<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.629> sprained<00:02:48.900> my
