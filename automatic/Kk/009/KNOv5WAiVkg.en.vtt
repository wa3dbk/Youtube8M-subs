Let’s see what ingredients are required for making basundi.

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.517
Full cream milk - 4 cup

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:28.498

00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:51.815
For making basundi boil milk first.

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:55.876
Turn on the gas and let the milk boil.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:09.977
Meanwhile cut cashew nuts, almonds and peel cardamom and make powder out of it.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:15.260
When milk starts boiling add the slice or chopped dry fruits in the milk.

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:25.747
Add cashew nuts, almonds, saffron and nutmeg powder in the milk.

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:29.135

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.907
Cook basundi on low flame.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.661
The moment it gets layered with cream stir it gently.

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:49.592
Cook until it gets thick on low flame.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:54.754
Milk has become quite thick now; we are left with only 1/3rd quantity of milk.

00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:05.378
Add sugar, cardamom powder to the basundi.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.034

Basundi is now ready. It has become thick.

00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:28.632
Take out the basundi in a bowl. Very thick basundi is now ready.

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:33.923
Garnish with pistachios.

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:39.957
We have used saffron for making basundi. It may also be called kesar basundi.

00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:53.154
