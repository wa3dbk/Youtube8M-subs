so<00:02:29.150> I'm<00:02:29.240> done<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.510> can<00:02:29.660> see<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:30.080> this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
so I'm done you can see like is this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.930 
so I'm done you can see like is this
short<00:02:30.620> too<00:02:30.800> long<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.580> want<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.760> keep

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
short too long because I want to keep

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.520 
short too long because I want to keep
everything<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.540> long<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.990> sides<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.470> am

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
everything in a long on the sides I am

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.260 
everything in a long on the sides I am
short<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:33.950> over<00:02:34.100> here<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.760> when<00:02:34.880> I'm<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
short on over here so when I'm going to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.580 
short on over here so when I'm going to
short<00:02:35.510> over<00:02:35.660> there<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:35.990> see<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.260> gradual

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
short over there I can see the gradual

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:48.880 
short over there I can see the gradual
nice<00:02:37.010> volume<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.640> over<00:02:37.880> here<00:02:47.410> when<00:02:48.410> we<00:02:48.620> after

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
nice volume on over here when we after

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.560 
nice volume on over here when we after
the<00:02:48.950> cut<00:02:49.130> we<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.550> always<00:02:49.970> measure<00:02:50.180> meant<00:02:50.390> to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
the cut we can always measure meant to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.260 
the cut we can always measure meant to
be<00:02:50.690> checks<00:02:51.500> into<00:02:51.770> sections<00:02:52.070> deposit<00:02:52.460> it<00:02:53.030> feed

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
be checks into sections deposit it feed

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.480 
be checks into sections deposit it feed
anything<00:02:53.660> wrong<00:02:54.050> will<00:02:54.260> always<00:02:54.980> tell<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.400> when

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
anything wrong will always tell you when

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.700 
anything wrong will always tell you when
you<00:02:55.700> measuring<00:02:56.210> up<00:02:59.110> move<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.260> same<00:03:00.440> thing

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
you measuring up move is the same thing

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:12.670 
you measuring up move is the same thing
on<00:03:00.920> my<00:03:00.980> other<00:03:01.400> segments<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.720> run<00:03:11.900> our<00:03:12.260> whole

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
on my other segments so we run our whole

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.440 
on my other segments so we run our whole
back<00:03:13.130> right<00:03:13.400> now<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.910> we<00:03:14.030> shall<00:03:14.180> be<00:03:14.330> like

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
back right now and we shall be like

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.470 
back right now and we shall be like
short<00:03:15.200> too<00:03:15.530> long<00:03:15.740> and<00:03:16.010> where<00:03:16.490> I<00:03:16.520> keep<00:03:16.730> very

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
short too long and where I keep very

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.210 
short too long and where I keep very
short<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:17.810> me<00:03:17.930> here<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.560> keep<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:18.890> long<00:03:19.070> to

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
short on me here and keep it long to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.640 
short on me here and keep it long to
case<00:03:19.400> through<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.670> volume<00:03:19.880> in<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.240> so<00:03:20.780> my<00:03:21.350> second

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
case through a volume in it so my second

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.110 
case through a volume in it so my second
like<00:03:21.770> a<00:03:21.860> short<00:03:22.280> first<00:03:22.550> VP<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.820> take<00:03:23.030> on

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
like a short first VP I take on

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.240 
like a short first VP I take on
diagonals<00:03:23.510> then<00:03:23.630> all<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:24.200> did<00:03:24.590> over<00:03:24.890> director

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
diagonals then all I did over director

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.580 
diagonals then all I did over director
to<00:03:25.370> 45<00:03:25.730> degree<00:03:26.090> same<00:03:26.570> as<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.900> other<00:03:27.080> sides<00:03:27.380> and

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
to 45 degree same as the other sides and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.260 
to 45 degree same as the other sides and
now<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.160> want<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.430> keep<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.760> longer<00:03:29.030> than<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
now I want to keep the longer than the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.390 
now I want to keep the longer than the
front<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:29.720> same<00:03:30.680> technique<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:31.100> going<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.340> use

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
front so same technique I'm going to use

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.310 
front so same technique I'm going to use
which<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:31.850> be<00:03:31.940> my<00:03:32.060> same<00:03:32.330> Diagnostics<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.200> I

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
which can be my same Diagnostics and I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.200 
which can be my same Diagnostics and I
am<00:03:33.380> going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.620> over<00:03:33.860> direct<00:03:33.980> hole<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.060> back

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
am going to over direct hole to the back

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.720 
am going to over direct hole to the back
code<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.920> make<00:03:36.920> sure<00:03:37.040> you're<00:03:37.190> like<00:03:37.340> guide

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.880 

so<00:03:47.520> I'm<00:03:47.670> done<00:03:47.850> with<00:03:47.910> my<00:03:48.420> complete<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.380> got<00:03:49.530> now

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
so I'm done with my complete I got now

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.770 
so I'm done with my complete I got now
so<00:03:50.070> after<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.490> I'm<00:03:50.610> going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.850> dry<00:03:51.540> her<00:03:51.750> hair

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
so after this I'm going to dry her hair

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.170 
so after this I'm going to dry her hair
to<00:03:52.110> check<00:03:52.320> do<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> lot<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.460> fracture<00:03:53.760> rising<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
to check do a lot of fracture rising it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.480 
to check do a lot of fracture rising it
because<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.630> want<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:54.960> set<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.920> volume<00:03:56.250> on<00:03:56.400> it

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
because I want to set the volume on it

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.430 
because I want to set the volume on it
all<00:03:56.700> over<00:03:56.880> around<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.420> her<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.690> no<00:03:57.840> need<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.050> do

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
all over around for her is no need to do

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.230 
all over around for her is no need to do
or<00:03:58.590> dryer<00:03:58.800> every<00:03:59.160> time<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.490> home<00:03:59.670> because<00:03:59.850> they

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
or dryer every time at home because they

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.630 
or dryer every time at home because they
cut<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.170> taught<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.560> learn<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.950> up<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:02.550> if

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
cut it then taught you learn it up so if

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
cut it then taught you learn it up so if
you<00:04:02.670> do<00:04:03.060> scrunch<00:04:03.540> also<00:04:03.900> looks<00:04:04.140> nicer<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.480> we

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
you do scrunch also looks nicer so we

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.360 
you do scrunch also looks nicer so we
done<00:04:09.840> our<00:04:09.870> hack<00:04:10.290> at<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.770> see<00:04:10.950> now<00:04:11.130> what<00:04:11.340> I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
done our hack at you can see now what I

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.890 
done our hack at you can see now what I
told<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:11.850> we're<00:04:12.090> going<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.360> keep<00:04:12.480> longer

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
told you like we're going to keep longer

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.930 
told you like we're going to keep longer
and<00:04:13.080> be<00:04:13.170> front<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.650> short<00:04:13.950> already<00:04:14.220> behind<00:04:14.310> he

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
and be front and short already behind he

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.180 
and be front and short already behind he
nice<00:04:15.240> watching<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.079> can<00:04:16.440> see<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> volume<00:04:16.859> now

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
nice watching and can see the volume now

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.890 
nice watching and can see the volume now
he<00:04:17.400> was<00:04:17.519> like<00:04:17.640> living<00:04:17.820> too<00:04:18.030> flat<00:04:18.299> now<00:04:18.540> we<00:04:18.600> have

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
he was like living too flat now we have

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.289 
he was like living too flat now we have
a<00:04:18.930> good<00:04:19.109> volume<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.609> keep<00:04:20.820> one<00:04:21.120> side

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
a good volume on it and I keep one side

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.090 
a good volume on it and I keep one side
longer<00:04:21.450> one<00:04:21.780> size<00:04:22.019> shorter<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.470> frame<00:04:22.950> our

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
longer one size shorter to frame our

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.760 
longer one size shorter to frame our
face<00:04:23.340> 90
