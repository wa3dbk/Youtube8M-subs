we have students that are definitely
more<00:04:22.889> willing<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.310> learn<00:04:23.490> we<00:04:24.060> are<00:04:24.150> able<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
more willing to learn we are able to

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.740 
more willing to learn we are able to
give<00:04:25.440> them<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.889> very<00:04:26.190> good<00:04:26.490> education<00:04:26.610> based<00:04:27.509> on

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
give them a very good education based on

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.249 
give them a very good education based on
well<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.620> low<00:04:29.100> budget<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:30.080> facilities<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
well a low budget and facilities that

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.810 
well a low budget and facilities that
maybe<00:04:31.650> aren't<00:04:31.919> as<00:04:32.039> great<00:04:32.340> as<00:04:32.490> some<00:04:32.639> other

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
maybe aren't as great as some other

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.400 
maybe aren't as great as some other
places<00:04:33.150> but<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.509> believe<00:04:33.810> we're<00:04:33.930> able<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.259> give

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
places but I believe we're able to give

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.529 
places but I believe we're able to give
them<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.650> better<00:04:34.830> education<00:04:35.539> especially

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
them a better education especially

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.390 
them a better education especially

every classroom our future vision is
that<00:05:33.840> we<00:05:33.960> would<00:05:34.110> actually<00:05:34.289> take<00:05:34.770> an<00:05:34.949> iPad<00:05:35.430> lab

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
that we would actually take an iPad lab

that we would actually take an iPad lab
into<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.960> classroom<00:05:37.500> which<00:05:37.949> would<00:05:38.159> make

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
into the classroom which would make

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.399 
into the classroom which would make
technology<00:05:39.330> even<00:05:39.510> more<00:05:39.720> accessible<00:05:40.080> for

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
technology even more accessible for
