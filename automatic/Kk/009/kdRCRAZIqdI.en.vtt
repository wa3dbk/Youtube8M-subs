there<00:00:46.469> his<00:00:46.890> head<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.910> lean

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
there his head is actually lean

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.979 
there his head is actually lean
backwards<00:00:49.520> due<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.760> transformation<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
backwards due to transformation and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.799 
backwards due to transformation and
because<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.149> whenever<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.239> looks<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
because of this whenever he looks to the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
because of this whenever he looks to the
side<00:00:55.079> he's<00:00:55.469> always<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> he's<00:00:56.219> kind<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
side he's always kind of he's kind of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:08.320 
side he's always kind of he's kind of
looking<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.739> side<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.190> back

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.040 

so<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.350> little<00:01:09.890> black<00:01:10.250> piece<00:01:10.550> there<00:01:11.050> does

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
so this a little black piece there does

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.610 
so this a little black piece there does
not<00:01:12.320> go<00:01:12.590> one<00:01:12.860> hundred<00:01:13.190> percent<00:01:13.300> vertical<00:01:14.620> it's

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
not go one hundred percent vertical it's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.170 
not go one hundred percent vertical it's
always<00:01:15.770> kind<00:01:16.160> of<00:01:16.220> leaning<00:01:16.640> back<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.880> you
