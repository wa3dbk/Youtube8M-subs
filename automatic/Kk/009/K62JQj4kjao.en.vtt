advanced warfare now personally I think

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
advanced warfare now personally I think
this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.680> kind<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> ploy<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.309> increase<00:00:36.090> DLC

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
this is kind of a ploy to increase DLC
sales<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.440> honestly<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> lot<00:00:38.430> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
sales because honestly not a lot of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.740

paint<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.690> DLC<00:00:46.050> especially<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.559> much<00:00:46.710> money

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
paint for DLC especially that much money

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
paint for DLC especially that much money
but<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> pry<00:00:47.789> way<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> increase

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
but this pry way for them to increase
those<00:00:49.079> DLC<00:00:49.530> sales<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

sneaky<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.390> they're<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:52.110> are

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
sneaky how they're doing it but they are

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
sneaky how they're doing it but they are
kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> teasing<00:00:52.949> some<00:00:53.520> zombie<00:00:53.820> game<00:00:54.000> play<00:00:54.239> in
