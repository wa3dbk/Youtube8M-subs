00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.259 
Dayton there's somebody applied their
big<00:02:33.709> scientific<00:02:34.340> mind<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.819> idea<00:02:35.120> and

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
big scientific mind to that idea and

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.350 
big scientific mind to that idea and
decided<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.500> let<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.220> idea<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.150> this

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
decided just to let this idea and this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.960 
decided just to let this idea and this
argument<00:02:38.840> spin<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:40.190> its<00:02:40.340> logical<00:02:40.580> extreme

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
argument spin out to its logical extreme

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.170 
argument spin out to its logical extreme
which<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.540> an<00:02:42.250> uncontrollably<00:02:43.250> super<00:02:43.940> gay

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
which is an uncontrollably super gay

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.479 
which is an uncontrollably super gay
military<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.080> how<00:02:45.530> bad<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.980> would<00:02:46.160> be<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
military and how bad that would be and

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.460 
military and how bad that would be and
what<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> wonderful<00:02:46.849> army<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.480> would<00:02:47.599> be<00:02:47.780> to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
what a wonderful army that would be to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.320 
what a wonderful army that would be to
fight<00:02:48.680> against<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.160> think<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.269> a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
fight against I think it's just it's a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.699 
fight against I think it's just it's a
fascination<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.930> just<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.319> it's<00:02:51.440> funny<00:02:51.620> that

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
fascination I just think it's funny that

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.500 
fascination I just think it's funny that
there's<00:02:52.370> somehow<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:52.970> notion<00:02:53.239> out<00:02:53.450> there

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
there's somehow this notion out there

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.059 
there's somehow this notion out there
that<00:02:53.780> if<00:02:53.870> you're<00:02:54.019> gay<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.349> just<00:02:54.799> aren't

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
that if you're gay you just aren't

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.850 
that if you're gay you just aren't
inclined<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.610> fight<00:02:55.849> right<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.079> also<00:02:57.319> that<00:02:57.680> if

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
inclined to fight right and also that if

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.009 
inclined to fight right and also that if
you<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.000> will<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.420> only<00:02:59.480> be

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
you that you will not only be

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.229 
you that you will not only be
disinclined<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.099> fight<00:03:01.549> but<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.910> will<00:03:02.030> be

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
disinclined to fight but you will be

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.080 
disinclined to fight but you will be
compelled<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.920> be<00:03:04.040> having<00:03:04.459> sex<00:03:04.760> with<00:03:04.849> the

compelled to be having sex with the
people<00:03:05.209> around<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.190> should<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.310> fighting

this<00:03:08.390> idea<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.079> interesting<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.680> idea<00:03:10.160> did

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
this idea it's interesting this idea did

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.789 
this idea it's interesting this idea did
I<00:03:10.819> think<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.690> could<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.110> come<00:03:12.319> because<00:03:12.530> it

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
I think it could have come because it

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.319 
I think it could have come because it
was<00:03:12.890> 1994<00:03:13.549> could<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:13.910> come<00:03:14.060> from<00:03:14.180> those

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
was 1994 could have come from those

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.850 
was 1994 could have come from those
debates<00:03:14.540> around<00:03:14.780> Don't<00:03:15.079> Ask<00:03:15.170> Don't<00:03:15.319> Tell<00:03:15.620> but

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
debates around Don't Ask Don't Tell but

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.490 
debates around Don't Ask Don't Tell but
this<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.340> also<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.670> recurring<00:03:17.239> idea<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.049> culture

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is also a recurring idea in culture

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500 
this is also a recurring idea in culture
for<00:03:18.829> example<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.730> movie<00:03:20.060> 300<00:03:20.900> very<00:03:21.709> similar

pornographic movies of recent

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.840 
pornographic movies of recent
generations<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.769> somewhat<00:03:28.430> based<00:03:28.609> on

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
generations and it's somewhat based on

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.400 
generations and it's somewhat based on
the<00:03:28.970> same<00:03:29.150> idea<00:03:29.480> Rachel<00:03:29.900> could<00:03:30.260> there<00:03:30.380> have

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
the same idea Rachel could there have

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.170 
the same idea Rachel could there have
been<00:03:30.530> an<00:03:30.709> upside<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.130> all<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.670> if<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.000> Air

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
only so that we don't think that they're
