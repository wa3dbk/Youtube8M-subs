got this lovely bit that comes down to
the<00:01:32.970> side<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.479> however<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.680> try<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the side here however if you try and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
the side here however if you try and
reverse<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.450> I'll<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:36.840> you

right now it doesn't quite have the same
effect<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.040> other<00:01:41.280> side<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.790> see

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
effect on the other side we can see

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
effect on the other side we can see
we've<00:01:42.090> got<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.329> strange<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:43.520> triangle

bit<00:01:44.700> coming<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> side<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
bit coming down the side and you know it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
bit coming down the side and you know it
just<00:01:46.500> doesn't<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:46.979> work<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.299> can

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that it's that necessary I mean this is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
that it's that necessary I mean this is
obviously<00:01:52.380> being<00:01:52.619> made<00:01:52.920> specifically<00:01:53.820> so

now this jacket I have to admit took a

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.960 
now this jacket I have to admit took a
hell<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.989> lot<00:03:43.230> longer<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:44.400> actually<00:03:44.730> took<00:03:44.909> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
hell of a lot longer it actually took a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.990 
hell of a lot longer it actually took a
whole<00:03:45.450> month<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> half<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:47.340> get<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.670> me<00:03:47.790> now

whole month and a half to get to me now

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.130 
whole month and a half to get to me now
the<00:03:48.720> reason<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.409> was<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.129> when<00:03:50.970> I

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
the reason for that was that when I

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.350 
the reason for that was that when I
bought<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.290> jacket<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:53.640> was<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.879> bit<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
bought the jacket there was a bit of a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.210 
bought the jacket there was a bit of a
delay<00:03:54.659> because<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.319> actually<00:03:55.470> had<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.860> change

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
delay because I actually had to change

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.160 
delay because I actually had to change
my<00:03:56.489> order<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:57.030> originally<00:03:57.689> ordered<00:03:57.900> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
my order I originally ordered the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.619 
my order I originally ordered the
trickster<00:03:58.920> design<00:03:59.430> which<00:03:59.610> was<00:03:59.730> very<00:04:00.120> similar

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
trickster design which was very similar

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.449 
trickster design which was very similar
to<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.049> however<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> accents<00:04:02.099> were<00:04:02.159> in<00:04:02.280> fact

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
to this however the accents were in fact

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.729 
to this however the accents were in fact
a<00:04:02.640> sort<00:04:02.849> of<00:04:02.879> emerald<00:04:03.659> green<00:04:03.840> now<00:04:04.530> when<00:04:04.709> I

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
a sort of emerald green now when I

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.320 
a sort of emerald green now when I
looked<00:04:04.950> at<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.129> picture<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:06.150> looked

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
looked at the picture of that it looked

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.420 
looked at the picture of that it looked
a<00:04:06.420> lot<00:04:06.569> darker<00:04:06.870> than<00:04:07.110> what<00:04:07.680> another<00:04:08.040> picture

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
a lot darker than what another picture

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.649 
a lot darker than what another picture
showed<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.909> it<00:04:08.970> turned<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.330> wasn't

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
showed and it turned out it wasn't

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.990 
showed and it turned out it wasn't
really<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.920> best<00:04:10.950> looking<00:04:11.489> jacket<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
really the best looking jacket so I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.509 
really the best looking jacket so I
decided<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.599> wanted<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> change<00:04:13.110> that

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
decided that I wanted to change that

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.490 
decided that I wanted to change that
they<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.849> look<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.209> they<00:04:15.330> saw<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.810> they

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
they have a look and they saw that they

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.229 
they have a look and they saw that they
didn't<00:04:17.009> have<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.340> stock<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.880> I'm<00:04:18.030> going<00:04:18.180> to

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
didn't have it in stock and I'm going to

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:18.479 
didn't have it in stock and I'm going to
have<00:04:18.329> to

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
have to

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.069 
have to
make<00:04:18.759> it<00:04:18.940> which<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.239> fine<00:04:19.449> that<00:04:19.479> usually<00:04:19.870> takes

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
make it which is fine that usually takes

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.170 
make it which is fine that usually takes
a<00:04:20.169> week<00:04:20.380> or<00:04:20.500> two<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.609> turned<00:04:21.819> out<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:21.940> had

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
a week or two but it turned out that had

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.029 
a week or two but it turned out that had
some<00:04:22.330> issues<00:04:22.720> in<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> actual<00:04:23.229> production<00:04:23.710> of

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
some issues in the actual production of

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.400 
some issues in the actual production of
it<00:04:24.250> which<00:04:25.030> was<00:04:25.210> effective<00:04:25.660> across<00:04:25.810> all<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.289> the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
it which was effective across all of the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.409 
it which was effective across all of the
harrier<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.949> I<00:04:27.699> believe<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.120> was<00:04:28.180> in<00:04:28.270> other

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
harrier and I believe it was in other
