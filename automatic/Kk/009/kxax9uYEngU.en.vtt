these are something that I think people

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.790 
these are something that I think people
are<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:27.990> starting<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.410> take<00:01:28.560> into

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
are really starting to take into

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.370 
are really starting to take into
consideration<00:01:29.390> do<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.870> something<00:01:31.110> that's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
consideration do we get something that's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
consideration do we get something that's
lightweight<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> grow<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.940> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
lightweight that we can grow with and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
lightweight that we can grow with and
then<00:01:33.270> move<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> second<00:01:34.740> stage<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
then move on to the second stage of that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.070 
then move on to the second stage of that
or<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.120> get<00:01:36.240> something<00:01:36.510> heavier<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.960> we

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
or do we get something heavier that we

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.680 
or do we get something heavier that we
can<00:01:37.230> maybe<00:01:37.380> last<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:37.920> extra<00:01:38.250> month<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:39.510> thing

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690
