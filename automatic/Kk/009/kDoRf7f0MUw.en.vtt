situations one either to defend the flag
in<00:01:25.350> combination<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.280> obviously<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.970> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
in combination so obviously it's a it's

building<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> whole<00:01:41.549> game<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
building and there the whole game it's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
building and there the whole game it's
it's<00:01:43.170> quite<00:01:43.320> acceptable<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.250> eyes<00:01:44.399> use

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it's quite acceptable in my eyes use

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.430 
it's quite acceptable in my eyes use
your<00:01:45.090> grenade<00:01:45.240> launcher<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.750> flush<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.380> out

your grenade launcher to flush them out

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.590 
your grenade launcher to flush them out
but<00:01:47.740> definitely<00:01:48.490> not<00:01:48.550> using<00:01:48.910> it<00:01:49.000> as<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.120> primary

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600
