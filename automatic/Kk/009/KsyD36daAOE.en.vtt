I<00:00:34.980> made<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> my<00:00:35.550> room<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.600> took<00:00:36.989> off

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
I made to my room is I actually took off

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.010 
I made to my room is I actually took off
my<00:00:37.289> closet<00:00:37.680> doors<00:00:37.949> and<00:00:38.340> hung<00:00:38.750> curtains<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
my closet doors and hung curtains in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.880 
my closet doors and hung curtains in
front<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.500> them<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.489> did<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.969> both

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
front of them which I did for both

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.880 
front of them which I did for both
function<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> also<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.780> look<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.410> think

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
function and also for the look I think

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
function and also for the look I think
that<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.399> does<00:00:47.640> look<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.120> better<00:00:48.359> with<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that it does look a lot better with the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.740 
that it does look a lot better with the
curtains<00:00:49.109> rather<00:00:49.680> than<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.699> doors<00:00:51.120> but

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
curtains rather than with the doors but

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.509 
curtains rather than with the doors but
it's<00:00:52.019> also<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.469> much<00:00:52.649> easier<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.430> my

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
it's also so much easier to get into my

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.490 
it's also so much easier to get into my
closet<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.809> doors<00:00:54.989> aren't<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.350> my

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
closet because the doors aren't in my

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
closet because the doors aren't in my
way<00:00:55.679> I<00:00:55.710> had<00:00:56.129> sliding<00:00:56.519> doors<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> half<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.600> my

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
way I had sliding doors and half of my

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
way I had sliding doors and half of my
closet<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.230> always<00:00:58.620> closed<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
closet was always closed and it's just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
closet was always closed and it's just
really<00:00:59.789> frustrating<00:01:00.000> especially<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:01.469> my

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
really frustrating especially in my

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.200 
really frustrating especially in my
craft<00:01:01.859> closet<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
craft closet because I have all the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
craft closet because I have all the
things<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.629> drawers<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.199> stuff<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
things with drawers and stuff like that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
things with drawers and stuff like that
so<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.370> really<00:01:05.519> frustrating<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.270> I'm

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so it was really frustrating so I'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.720 
so it was really frustrating so I'm
really<00:01:06.600> glad<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.020> did<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:08.550> the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
really glad that I did this I got the

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.210 
really glad that I did this I got the
curtains<00:01:09.120> from<00:01:09.360> Ikea<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.010> rods

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
curtains from Ikea and I got the rods

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.900 
curtains from Ikea and I got the rods
from<00:01:11.550> Walmart<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.720> rods<00:01:13.410> were<00:01:13.980> $10<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.790> then

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
from Walmart the rods were $10 and then

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.700 
from Walmart the rods were $10 and then
the<00:01:15.120> curtains<00:01:15.420> were<00:01:15.540> $10<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.170> those<00:01:16.350> were<00:01:16.590> both

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the curtains were $10 so those were both

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.300 
the curtains were $10 so those were both
pretty<00:01:16.980> good

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
pretty good

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.260 
pretty good
I<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.850> $40<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:20.070> whole<00:01:20.310> wall<00:01:20.730> isn't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I think $40 for this whole wall isn't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530 
I think $40 for this whole wall isn't
that<00:01:21.420> bad<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:23.100> curtains<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.180> super

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that bad the curtains are actually super

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.740 
that bad the curtains are actually super
long<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.230> hem<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.470> bottom<00:01:25.880> which<00:01:26.880> was

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
long I have to hem the bottom which was

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
long I have to hem the bottom which was
nice<00:01:28.050> because<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.620> afraid<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.130> were

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
nice because I was afraid that they were

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.590 
nice because I was afraid that they were
gonna<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.550> too<00:01:29.790> short<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.540> gonna

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
gonna be too short and that I was gonna

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.320 
gonna be too short and that I was gonna
have<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.960> add<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:32.040> actually<00:01:32.580> they're<00:01:32.820> really

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
have to add but actually they're really

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.540 
have to add but actually they're really
really<00:01:33.600> long<00:01:33.870> so<00:01:34.260> if<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.440> wanted<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.010> some

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
really long so if you wanted to get some

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.920 
really long so if you wanted to get some
curtains<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:35.910> Ikea<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.330> don't<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
curtains from Ikea I don't think you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.570 
curtains from Ikea I don't think you
have<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> worry<00:01:37.350> about<00:01:37.410> them<00:01:37.740> being<00:01:37.950> too<00:01:38.280> short

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
have to worry about them being too short

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.380 
have to worry about them being too short
so<00:01:39.380> I'm<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.530> excited<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so I'm really excited about that and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
so I'm really excited about that and
then<00:01:43.230> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> middle<00:01:43.890> between<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.580> two

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
then in the middle between the two

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.210 
then in the middle between the two
closets<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.510> did<00:01:45.780> hang<00:01:46.080> this<00:01:46.410> mirror<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:46.830> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
closets I did hang this mirror and this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
closets I did hang this mirror and this
mirror<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> got<00:01:47.850> from<00:01:48.720> Walmart<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.350> like

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
mirror I got from Walmart actually like

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.140 
mirror I got from Walmart actually like
years<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.220> years<00:01:50.400> ago<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.090> been

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
years and years ago and it's been

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.540 
years and years ago and it's been
hanging<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.690> my<00:01:51.840> bathroom<00:01:52.260> but<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> edge<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
hanging in my bathroom but the edge of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.300 
hanging in my bathroom but the edge of
it<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> border<00:01:54.750> started<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.500> break<00:01:56.010> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it like the border started to break and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.040 
it like the border started to break and
so<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.730> was<00:01:56.850> getting<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.180> frustrated<00:01:57.900> with

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
so I was getting really frustrated with

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.830 
so I was getting really frustrated with
it<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> still<00:01:59.940> like<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> mirror<00:02:00.660> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it and but I still like the mirror like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300 
it and but I still like the mirror like
I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.260> makes<00:02:01.410> me<00:02:01.530> look<00:02:01.650> really<00:02:01.710> skinny

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I think it makes me look really skinny

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
I think it makes me look really skinny
so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.080> mirror<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
so I really like this mirror so I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.730 
so I really like this mirror so I
decided<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.270> keep<00:02:06.480> it<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.680> took

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
decided that I would keep it and I took

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.380 
decided that I would keep it and I took
the<00:02:08.009> rest<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> border<00:02:08.640> off<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> hung<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the rest of the border off and I hung it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.320 
the rest of the border off and I hung it
between<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:09.989> two<00:02:10.259> curtains<00:02:10.619> be

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
between these two curtains be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.680 
between these two curtains be
because<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.780> thought<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.680> would<00:02:13.540> make<00:02:14.540> my

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
because I thought that it would make my

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.200 
because I thought that it would make my
room<00:02:14.900> look<00:02:15.080> bigger<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.560> brighter<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.850> I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
room look bigger and brighter and I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.490 
room look bigger and brighter and I
really<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.630> think<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:17.990> does<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.350> I've

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
really do think it does like I've

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.020 
really do think it does like I've
actually<00:02:18.770> taken<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.370> mirror<00:02:19.550> off<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.880> looked

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
actually taken the mirror off and looked

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.850 
actually taken the mirror off and looked
at<00:02:20.180> my<00:02:20.810> wall<00:02:20.990> without<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:21.650> put<00:02:21.770> it

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
at my wall without it and then put it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.350 
at my wall without it and then put it
back<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.520> makes<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.820> look<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.000> much

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
back on and it makes it look so much

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.900 
back on and it makes it look so much
better<00:02:23.960> if<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.830> guys<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.370> ever<00:02:25.640> watched
