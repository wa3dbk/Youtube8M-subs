00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.899 
and after effects to make for really
quick<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.499> simple<00:01:57.859> editing<00:01:58.429> throughout<00:01:58.729> the

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
quick and simple editing throughout the

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.889 
quick and simple editing throughout the
final<00:01:59.270> production<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.759> this<00:02:02.119> was<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.359> very

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
final production so this was a very

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.319 
final production so this was a very
unique<00:02:03.289> project<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.369> work<00:02:04.549> on<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.119> learned

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
unique project to work on and I learned

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.090 
unique project to work on and I learned
a<00:02:05.450> great<00:02:05.569> deal<00:02:05.689> about<00:02:05.960> how<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.740> efficiently

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
a great deal about how to efficiently

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.660 
a great deal about how to efficiently
work<00:02:07.609> between<00:02:07.880> 3d<00:02:08.300> studio<00:02:08.509> max<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.670> adobe

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
work between 3d studio max and adobe

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.300 
work between 3d studio max and adobe
after<00:02:11.000> effects<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.379> use<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.530> state<00:02:12.980> sets

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
after effects with the use of state sets

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.059 
after effects with the use of state sets
so<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.569> session<00:02:14.780> I'd<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.739> share

accomplishing<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> following<00:02:43.790> tasks<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
accomplishing the following tasks the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.589 
accomplishing the following tasks the
first<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.439> is<00:02:45.469> how<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.400> set<00:02:46.730> up<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:46.909> scene<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.299> 3d

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
first one is how to set up a scene in 3d

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.539 
first one is how to set up a scene in 3d
studio<00:02:47.810> max<00:02:48.230> with<00:02:48.530> some<00:02:48.739> simple<00:02:48.980> pop<00:02:49.340> up

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
studio max with some simple pop up

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.119 
studio max with some simple pop up
animations<00:02:50.260> similar<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.560> what<00:02:51.769> was<00:02:51.889> in<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
animations similar to what was in the

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.250 
animations similar to what was in the
video<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.609> how<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.329> buildings<00:02:54.079> were

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
video and how the the buildings were

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.129 
video and how the the buildings were
revealed<00:02:54.889> throughout<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.579> animations<00:02:56.389> will

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
revealed throughout the animations will

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.789 
revealed throughout the animations will
be<00:02:57.230> focusing<00:02:57.739> on<00:02:57.919> animating<00:02:58.819> visibility

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
be focusing on animating visibility

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.949 
be focusing on animating visibility
animating<00:03:00.969> simple<00:03:01.969> translations<00:03:02.659> and<00:03:02.840> then

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
animating simple translations and then

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.039 
animating simple translations and then
also<00:03:03.169> animating<00:03:03.949> some<00:03:04.189> modifiers<00:03:04.900> we'll<00:03:05.900> also

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
also animating some modifiers we'll also

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.920 
also animating some modifiers we'll also
go<00:03:06.379> over<00:03:06.409> a<00:03:06.680> basic<00:03:07.459> setup<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.939> camera<00:03:08.419> rig<00:03:08.659> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
go over a basic setup of camera rig and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.729 
go over a basic setup of camera rig and
also<00:03:09.530> how<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.769> animate<00:03:10.370> those<00:03:10.819> cameras

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
also how to animate those cameras

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.069 
also how to animate those cameras
efficiently<00:03:12.969> then<00:03:13.969> we'll<00:03:14.150> move<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.659> state

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
efficiently then we'll move on to state

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.069 
efficiently then we'll move on to state
sets<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.739> not<00:03:16.669> only<00:03:16.939> how<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.150> create<00:03:17.719> render

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
sets and not only how to create render

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.860 
sets and not only how to create render
passes<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.739> also<00:03:18.949> how<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.400> set<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.120> state<00:03:20.540> sets

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
passes but also how to set up state sets

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.979 
passes but also how to set up state sets
in<00:03:21.049> order<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.439> export<00:03:21.949> objects<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.759> also<00:03:23.720> link

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
in order to export objects and also link

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.469 
in order to export objects and also link
them<00:03:24.169> to<00:03:24.290> after<00:03:24.680> effects<00:03:25.009> so<00:03:25.250> things<00:03:25.519> similar

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
them to after effects so things similar

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.150 
them to after effects so things similar
to<00:03:26.930> cameras<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.150> polygons
