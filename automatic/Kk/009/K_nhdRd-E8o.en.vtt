00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
turn drop open this is doing what for

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.520 
turn drop open this is doing what for
what<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.400> doing<00:01:36.759> is<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.570> leg<00:01:38.320> that's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
what this is doing is the leg that's

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.370 
what this is doing is the leg that's
turning<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.640> squeezing<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.630> side<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
turning in is squeezing the side of the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.039 
turning in is squeezing the side of the
of<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:42.040> colon<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.640> as<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.240> go<00:01:43.450> down<00:01:43.720> it

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
of the colon and as you go down it

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.039 
of the colon and as you go down it
squeezes<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.009> as<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.460> go<00:01:45.820> up<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.450> opens<00:01:46.900> it

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
squeezes it and as you go up it opens it

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.990 
squeezes it and as you go up it opens it
so<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.259> basically<00:01:47.619> massaging<00:01:48.490> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
so it's basically massaging the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.730 
so it's basically massaging the
ascending<00:01:49.570> colon<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.140> descending<00:01:50.710> colon

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
ascending colon and the descending colon

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.710 
ascending colon and the descending colon
so<00:01:51.159> it's<00:01:51.310> stimulating<00:01:51.579> these<00:01:52.060> two<00:01:52.240> parts<00:01:52.600> of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
so it's stimulating these two parts of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.230 
so it's stimulating these two parts of
your<00:01:53.140> lower<00:01:53.470> abdomen<00:01:53.890> as<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.250> go<00:01:54.369> down<00:01:54.549> you're

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
your lower abdomen as you go down you're

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.819 
your lower abdomen as you go down you're
gonna<00:01:55.420> be<00:01:55.600> using<00:01:55.990> all<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.259> muscles<00:01:56.439> in<00:01:56.799> your

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
gonna be using all the muscles in your

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.590 
gonna be using all the muscles in your
thighs<00:01:57.159> which<00:01:57.490> increases<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.270> blood<00:01:58.450> flow

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
thighs which increases the blood flow

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.960 
thighs which increases the blood flow
down<00:01:59.530> from<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.950> heart<00:02:00.189> through<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.670> femoral

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
down from the heart through the femoral

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.840 
down from the heart through the femoral
artery<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.540> pumps<00:02:02.049> blood<00:02:02.409> into<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.399> region

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
artery and pumps blood into this region

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.389 
artery and pumps blood into this region
