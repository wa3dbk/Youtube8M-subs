because it's just insane how hard
I'm<00:01:48.040> trying<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.370> do<00:01:48.520> here<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:48.910> I'm<00:01:49.000> like

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
I'm trying to do here and I'm like

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.850 
I'm trying to do here and I'm like
almost<00:01:49.480> sliding<00:01:49.960> off<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.080> track<00:01:50.470> as<00:01:50.740> this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
almost sliding off the track as this

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.060 
almost sliding off the track as this
thing<00:01:51.040> has<00:01:51.220> too<00:01:51.550> much<00:01:51.760> power<00:01:52.060> but<00:01:52.890> overall<00:01:53.890> I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
thing has too much power but overall I

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.220 
thing has too much power but overall I
mean<00:01:54.460> if<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.790> could<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.270> this<00:01:55.450> car<00:01:55.660> if<00:01:55.840> there

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
mean if I could see this car if there

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.720 
mean if I could see this car if there
was<00:01:56.350> some<00:01:56.590> way<00:01:56.620> where<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.220> could<00:01:57.400> take<00:01:57.580> out

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
was some way where you could take out

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.910 
was some way where you could take out
the<00:01:57.850> engine<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:58.330> maybe<00:01:59.200> could<00:01:59.590> probably

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the engine which maybe could probably

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.970 
the engine which maybe could probably
not<00:02:00.280> or<00:02:00.580> at<00:02:01.300> least<00:02:01.330> put<00:02:01.990> some<00:02:02.020> restrictors<00:02:02.800> on

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
not or at least put some restrictors on

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.710 
not or at least put some restrictors on
this<00:02:03.160> car<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:04.000> lower<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.479> amount<00:02:04.540> of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
this car to lower the amount of

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.530 
this car to lower the amount of
horsepower<00:02:04.900> it's<00:02:05.440> giving<00:02:05.860> out<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:07.030> could<00:02:07.330> see

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
horsepower it's giving out I I could see

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.810 
horsepower it's giving out I I could see
this<00:02:07.720> thing<00:02:07.960> being<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:08.470> not<00:02:08.710> too<00:02:08.979> bad<00:02:09.280> drift<00:02:09.580> car

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
this thing being a not too bad drift car

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.940 
this thing being a not too bad drift car
has<00:02:10.240> a<00:02:10.270> little<00:02:10.630> Lotus<00:02:11.050> Elise<00:02:11.380> kind<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.740> look<00:02:11.920> to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
has a little Lotus Elise kind of look to

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.250 
has a little Lotus Elise kind of look to
it<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.880> see<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.270> doing<00:02:13.570> pretty<00:02:13.959> good<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
it I can see it doing pretty good and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.590 
it I can see it doing pretty good and
through<00:02:15.100> its<00:02:15.220> transitions<00:02:15.910> as<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.240> can<00:02:16.420> see

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
through its transitions as you can see

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.960 
through its transitions as you can see
it's<00:02:16.840> not<00:02:17.080> bad<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.550> only<00:02:18.760> bad

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
it's not bad like it's just the only bad

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's not bad like it's just the only bad
part<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.420> has<00:02:19.959> too<00:02:20.110> much<00:02:20.230> power<00:02:20.530> if<00:02:21.130> you

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
part is just has too much power if you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.830 
part is just has too much power if you
didn't<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.730> much<00:02:21.760> power<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.360> could<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
didn't have as much power it could be a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840 
didn't have as much power it could be a
good<00:02:23.050> drift<00:02:23.320> car<00:02:23.530> I'm<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.580> best

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
good drift car I'm not the best

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.160 
good drift car I'm not the best
obviously<00:02:25.390> but<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.570> could<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.780> good<00:02:25.959> like

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
obviously but it could be good like

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.900 
obviously but it could be good like
right<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:26.590> again<00:02:26.950> almost<00:02:27.160> sliding<00:02:27.760> off<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
right there again almost sliding off the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.510 
right there again almost sliding off the
track<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:29.140> couldn't<00:02:29.500> keep<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.070> line<00:02:30.130> it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
track I just couldn't keep it in line it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.150 
track I just couldn't keep it in line it
was<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:30.820> very<00:02:31.000> very<00:02:31.570> powerful<00:02:31.930> but<00:02:32.350> overall

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
was just very very powerful but overall

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.520 
was just very very powerful but overall
