00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
spruce on the front now we make sure

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.930 
spruce on the front now we make sure
that<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.050> pegs<00:00:25.349> are<00:00:25.619> easy<00:00:25.919> to<00:00:26.160> turn<00:00:26.339> easy<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
conical so you need to push in while you

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.890 
conical so you need to push in while you
tune<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:42.060> should<00:00:42.240> be<00:00:42.360> smooth<00:00:42.690> they

should look you know make it really hard
to<00:00:45.540> find<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> exact<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.410> position<00:00:46.590> okay

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
to find the exact right position okay

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
to find the exact right position okay
and<00:00:47.490> you<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.360> fine<00:00:48.660> tuners<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.200> the

more advanced violin because you're

you have a long sound post it'll be in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.219 
you have a long sound post it'll be in
there<00:01:08.850> too<00:01:08.999> tight<00:01:09.240> it'll<00:01:09.450> dampen<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> sound

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
if you have a short sound post the only

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.149 
if you have a short sound post the only
way<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.509> get<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:12.810> proper<00:01:13.259> tension<00:01:13.499> so<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:13.979> get

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
way to get the proper tension so you get

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.800 
way to get the proper tension so you get
enough<00:01:14.429> vibration<00:01:14.609> between<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.359> top<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
enough vibration between the top and the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
enough vibration between the top and the
bottom<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> pull<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.249> out<00:01:17.369> too<00:01:17.819> close<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
bottom is to pull it out too close to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.029 
bottom is to pull it out too close to
the<00:01:18.390> F<00:01:18.479> hole<00:01:18.749> and<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.380> gives<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.679> a<00:01:19.710> brighter

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
the F hole and that gives you a brighter

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.219 
the F hole and that gives you a brighter
sound<00:01:20.399> if<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.759> sound<00:01:20.999> post<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.359> closer<00:01:21.929> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
sound if your sound post is closer to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590 
sound if your sound post is closer to
the<00:01:22.319> e-string<00:01:22.560> side<00:01:23.100> rather<00:01:23.729> than<00:01:23.909> right

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the e-string side rather than right

underneath that right foot slightly
behind<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.079> way<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.229> don't<00:01:28.469> want<00:01:28.649> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
behind by the way you don't want it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.739 
behind by the way you don't want it
under<00:01:29.039> but<00:01:29.219> and<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.179> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> exact

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
under but and we put it in the exact

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:32.090 
under but and we put it in the exact
right<00:01:30.840> position<00:01:31.139> so<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
right position so you don't need to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.809 
right position so you don't need to
worry<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
worry about it

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.910 
worry about it
we<00:01:33.060> even<00:01:33.210> shift<00:01:33.539> them<00:01:33.749> with<00:01:34.139> tension<00:01:34.649> on<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
we even shift them with tension on the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.879 
we even shift them with tension on the
strings<00:01:35.249> but<00:01:35.429> we<00:01:35.549> put<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.789> cardboard<00:01:36.889> insert

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
strings but we put a cardboard insert

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.739 
strings but we put a cardboard insert
here<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.340> make<00:01:38.490> sure<00:01:38.639> the<00:01:38.759> bridge<00:01:38.969> can't<00:01:39.299> fall

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
here to make sure the bridge can't fall

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.510 
here to make sure the bridge can't fall
or<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.319> knocked<00:01:40.530> over<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.100> shipped<00:01:41.369> in

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
or get knocked over if it's shipped in
