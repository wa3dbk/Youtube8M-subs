needle<00:03:47.580> through<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.880> loop<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.450> second

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
needle through the loop on the second

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.699 
needle through the loop on the second
peg<00:03:49.130> all<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.580> way<00:03:50.700> through<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.380> then<00:03:52.380> pull

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
peg all the way through it and then pull

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.160 
peg all the way through it and then pull
the<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.370> remaining<00:03:54.000> yarn<00:03:54.269> through<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.959> loop

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
the the remaining yarn through the loop

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.800 
the the remaining yarn through the loop
and<00:03:55.440> when<00:03:55.769> it's<00:03:55.950> all<00:03:56.190> done<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.239> take<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> loop

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
and when it's all done you take the loop

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.340 
and when it's all done you take the loop
off<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.410> peg<00:03:59.570> sorry<00:04:00.570> I'm<00:04:00.630> coming<00:04:00.780> off-camera

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
off the peg sorry I'm coming off-camera

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.970 
off the peg sorry I'm coming off-camera
but<00:04:01.910> there<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.090> take<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.450> off<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.989> peg<00:04:04.170> use

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
but there you take it off the peg use

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.470 
but there you take it off the peg use
your<00:04:05.220> knitting<00:04:05.430> hook<00:04:05.580> if<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.880> need<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.450> need

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
your knitting hook if you need to I need

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.289 
your knitting hook if you need to I need
it<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.900> on<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.049> one<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:07.500> kind<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.769> tight

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
it to on that one it was kind of tight

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.539 
it to on that one it was kind of tight
so<00:04:09.299> through<00:04:09.750> your<00:04:09.959> loop<00:04:10.340> make<00:04:11.340> sure<00:04:11.489> it

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
so through your loop make sure it

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.949 
so through your loop make sure it
doesn't<00:04:11.760> get<00:04:11.820> caught<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.060> anything<00:04:12.269> else<00:04:12.660> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
doesn't get caught on anything else and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.080 
doesn't get caught on anything else and
then<00:04:13.590> take<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.980> loop<00:04:14.160> off<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.610> peg<00:04:14.850> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
then take the loop off the peg and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.229 
then take the loop off the peg and
you're<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.079> do<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:16.290> for<00:04:16.500> all<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.890> the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
you're going to do this for all of the

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.060 
you're going to do this for all of the
pegs<00:04:18.239> until<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.959> finish<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> very<00:04:19.890> last

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
pegs until you finish on the very last

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.150 
pegs until you finish on the very last
one<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.870> when<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.169> get<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.560> very<00:04:22.740> last<00:04:22.950> one

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
one so when you get to the very last one

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.700 
one so when you get to the very last one
you're<00:04:24.150> going<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.419> knit<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.690> through<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.200> as

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
you're going to knit it through and as

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.620 
you're going to knit it through and as
you<00:04:25.950> take<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.310> off<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.760> peg

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
you take it off the peg

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.450 
you take it off the peg

it<00:07:06.400> over<00:07:06.460> which<00:07:07.000> is<00:07:07.180> the<00:07:07.660> section<00:07:08.020> that<00:07:08.050> I<00:07:08.230> had

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
it over which is the section that I had

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.320 
it over which is the section that I had
to<00:07:08.980> sew<00:07:09.190> together<00:07:09.660> so<00:07:10.660> I<00:07:10.690> close<00:07:11.170> it<00:07:11.320> around<00:07:11.560> I

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
to sew together so I close it around I

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.770 
to sew together so I close it around I
loop<00:07:13.330> I<00:07:13.680> feed<00:07:14.680> my<00:07:14.940> remaining<00:07:15.940> yarn<00:07:16.390> through

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
loop I feed my remaining yarn through

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.470 
loop I feed my remaining yarn through
the<00:07:16.900> knitting<00:07:17.140> needle<00:07:17.410> and<00:07:18.090> I<00:07:19.090> sew<00:07:19.450> it

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 
the knitting needle and I sew it

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.800 
the knitting needle and I sew it
together<00:07:19.690> so<00:07:20.850> push<00:07:21.850> the<00:07:22.000> needle<00:07:22.270> from<00:07:22.360> one<00:07:22.660> end

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
together so push the needle from one end

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.280 
together so push the needle from one end
of<00:07:22.990> the<00:07:23.490> little<00:07:24.490> block<00:07:24.880> of<00:07:24.960> extra<00:07:25.960> yarn<00:07:26.140> that

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
of the little block of extra yarn that

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.020 
of the little block of extra yarn that
you<00:07:26.380> added<00:07:26.530> to<00:07:26.680> your<00:07:26.800> headband<00:07:27.280> to<00:07:27.760> the<00:07:27.880> other

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
you added to your headband to the other

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.410 
you added to your headband to the other
side<00:07:28.270> and<00:07:28.960> then<00:07:29.890> when<00:07:30.100> it's<00:07:30.220> tight<00:07:30.460> do<00:07:31.120> it<00:07:31.240> to

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.420 
side and then when it's tight do it to

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.040 
side and then when it's tight do it to
the<00:07:31.540> other<00:07:31.660> side

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
the other side

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.860 
the other side
um<00:07:32.110> this<00:07:33.070> is<00:07:33.190> basically<00:07:33.520> closing<00:07:34.210> it<00:07:34.330> off<00:07:34.419> so

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
um this is basically closing it off so

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.720 
um this is basically closing it off so
that<00:07:34.900> you<00:07:35.080> have<00:07:35.260> that<00:07:35.440> little<00:07:35.500> accent<00:07:36.190> you<00:07:36.580> can

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:36.730 
that you have that little accent you can

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.250 
that you have that little accent you can
make<00:07:36.850> this<00:07:36.940> any<00:07:37.150> color<00:07:37.300> you<00:07:37.570> want<00:07:37.690> or<00:07:38.020> you<00:07:38.140> can

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260 
make this any color you want or you can

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.570 
make this any color you want or you can
even<00:07:38.380> change<00:07:38.650> the<00:07:38.800> style<00:07:39.130> of<00:07:39.250> yarn<00:07:39.460> that

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
even change the style of yarn that

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.909 
even change the style of yarn that
you're<00:07:39.700> using<00:07:40.000> so<00:07:40.750> basically<00:07:41.140> just<00:07:41.230> close<00:07:41.710> it

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 
you're using so basically just close it

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.320 
you're using so basically just close it
off<00:07:42.100> so<00:07:42.280> that<00:07:42.310> it's<00:07:42.520> nice<00:07:42.669> and<00:07:42.700> tight<00:07:43.060> and<00:07:43.270> then

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330 
off so that it's nice and tight and then

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.659 
off so that it's nice and tight and then
you<00:07:43.960> won't<00:07:44.110> see<00:07:44.440> where<00:07:44.770> you<00:07:44.980> actually<00:07:45.400> knit

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:45.669 
you won't see where you actually knit

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.340 
you won't see where you actually knit
close<00:07:46.120> to<00:07:46.360> your<00:07:46.450> headband<00:07:46.750> so<00:07:47.050> it'll<00:07:47.260> look

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.350 
close to your headband so it'll look

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020
