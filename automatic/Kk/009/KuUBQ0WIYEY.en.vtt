 antonio me he is the signals on how 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.090
 make a mosquito or food crop 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.350
 for your fish 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.070
 let's get to say 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.320
 in my converted mosquito culture 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.760
 many larvae and also mosquitoes 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.439
 I already have it a few 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.279
 weeks that's why he's like this with a lot 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.279
 many larvae and mosquitoes 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 we need a jar or a plastic cup 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.670
 big 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.160
 what else do we need we need fruit 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.020
 that is in the process of decomposition does not 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.600
 completely decomposed but yes in 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.300
 decomposition process can be 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.530
 banana orange apple pear or any 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 type of fruit 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.320
 what else do we need another bottle 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 or in my case I have a glass of glass in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.030
 which serves to receive mosquitoes 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.960
 which I'm going to give my fish 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.659
 two elastics here I have highlight two 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.110
 elastic we need deep bands like 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:24.759
 in another country and we also need a 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.759
 sorry no napkins or two 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.520
 napkins or newspaper 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.090
 newspaper as they call it in their countries 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.740
 and we also need a plastic or 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.300
 cardboard or cardboard to be able to put it 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.430
 between means for when we take out the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.900
 others we mosquitoes to give it to 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.300
 our fish 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.650
 so that they do not escape a good 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
 so that does not leak a good 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.570
 amount of mosquitoes 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.180
 ok let's start 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.430
 after these materials we have in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:04.440
 our jar enter the amount of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.820
 fruit to be able to make mosquitoes 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.970
 that we do this let us know the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.910
 bookseller we leave it in place in the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.800
 which cat has mosquitoes in which 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.930
 find other mosquitoes 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.840
 this can last approximately two 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.680
 hours or three hours depending on the day and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.680
 also the weather 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 when it is already done when they look and check 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.590
 and see that it is already in the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.740
 inside of the three mosquitoes flies already 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.520
 I'm going to cover it 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.710
 what do we do we go fishing we cap and with 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.760
 the elastic youtube in 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:49.510
 we must wait approximately 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.970
 five hours or one day depending 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 so that it can be reproduced and appear 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.850
 larvae 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.810
 the larvae 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.810
 and when they are inside the can 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.460
 exactly how much time must pass 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.780
 but I about the whole week 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.780
 so that there were already many mosquitoes 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.060
 but they should be following pardon but 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.810
 live and checking every day 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.069
 and then to get our 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.440
 mosquitoes when they are whole we should 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.280
 take out this quickly put 3 jar 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.450
 glass in the case like this in this way 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.750
 we take out inner side 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.400
 We offer our plastic or carton or 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.040
 cardboard 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.040
 we do this we put it inside 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.520
 so that a month ago with so that 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.340
 I did not arrived 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.560
 do not get too mosquitoes and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.420
 we have the amount needed to 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.340
 give our fish 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.709
 what do we do now quickly from 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.390
 we install and we go with it with the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.890
 napkin 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.890
 since it is so quickly 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:18.340
 we put aside this and end up covering 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.630
 with our elastic we proceed to cover 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.370
 in this way 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.530
 all right 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.690
 since we have our mosquitoes for 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.940
 our fish we must cut from 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.830
 we must keep our culture 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.830
 but the truth is that the AlavÃ©s 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.450
 well then we have our cover 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.960
 we leave it aside and this 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:50.270
 we have to take the freezer freezer 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.270
 or preserve as what you have 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.340
 you have to have about 7 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.210
 minutes 25 minutes in the freezer for 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.139
 that the mosquitoes are frozen 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.630
 good 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.210
 we usually have how to do it 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.170
 and you will see how to color this 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.170
 mosquitoes to your fish 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.630
 now let's review how they are 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.630
 our mosquitoes 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.210
 is seen here as both look 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.780
 and they are all frozen 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.780
 all right 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.390
 we close 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.220
 and let's go to our fish 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.130
 all right 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.280
 a new novelty I have seven I need 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.230
 know how they are going to travel 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.440
 They are expensive and with skin 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.540
 what we do the following we were 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.430
 we see the mosquitoes 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.680
 and it is very good it is always advisable 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.200
 cut the filter current either 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.040
 internal and external so that you can eat 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:10.060
 comfortably and well no no 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:13.060
 do not bring food the filter is 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.060
 say it 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.660
 had said to swallow would be that 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.240
 pond that you take that would be the 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.240
 food and waste to the filter 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.280
 then we are a bit two insects 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.280
 as you can see there they fell 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.150
 a good amount for the little fish and 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.100
 that many are equally varied 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.760
 I have them in this temporary aquarium that 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.860
 I have the new aquarium ready but they are 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.980
 following the left for about two weeks 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.980
 approximately 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.550
 we wait for them to eat them and 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.530
 would be 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:01.110
 then you know how to make this this 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.430
 mosquito breeding I hope you have 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.380
