00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
but I'm still gonna put them down as a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
but I'm still gonna put them down as a
pro<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.359> he<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.199> could<00:01:01.350> easily<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
I came very very close to scoring a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.250 
I came very very close to scoring a
couple<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> times<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.549> long<00:01:05.880> range<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.570> even

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
couple of times from long range and even

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
couple of times from long range and even
from<00:01:07.470> short<00:01:07.799> range<00:01:07.860> his<00:01:08.250> finishing<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
from short range his finishing is so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
from short range his finishing is so
awesome<00:01:09.510> his<00:01:09.990> shot<00:01:10.350> power<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.850> he's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
awesome his shot power is very what he's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.399

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
shooting in the penalty area is very

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.090 
shooting in the penalty area is very
powerful

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
powerful

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
powerful
I<00:01:14.130> love<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> time<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> goalkeeper<00:01:15.630> would

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I love the time the goalkeeper would

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.170 
I love the time the goalkeeper would
have<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.259> chance<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.770> saving<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
have no chance in saving it now as a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170 
have no chance in saving it now as a
finisher<00:01:18.840> he<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.439> very<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.250> clinical<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
finisher he is very very clinical in the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.700 
finisher he is very very clinical in the
penalty<00:01:21.509> area<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> best

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
penalty area really one of the best

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.490 
penalty area really one of the best
finishes<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> same<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.290> makes

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
finishes and at the same time what makes

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
finishes and at the same time what makes
him<00:01:25.680> even<00:01:26.009> better<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> penalty<00:01:27.060> area<00:01:27.090> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
him even better in the penalty area is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
him even better in the penalty area is
when<00:01:27.930> he's<00:01:28.080> surrounded<00:01:28.439> by<00:01:28.650> defenders<00:01:29.340> he

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
when he's surrounded by defenders he

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
when he's surrounded by defenders he
could<00:01:30.030> easily<00:01:30.240> win<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> penalties<00:01:31.170> because

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
could easily win you penalties because

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
could easily win you penalties because
his<00:01:31.619> balance<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.400> low<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:33.240> could<00:01:33.720> him

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
his balance is so low he could him

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.219 
his balance is so low he could him
fall<00:01:34.140> down<00:01:34.170> very<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:34.979> easily<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
fall down very very easily now he is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.249 
fall down very very easily now he is
strong<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.520> he<00:01:38.820> does<00:01:39.030> fall<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.659> ground<00:01:39.869> pre

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

the only way they could tackle him off
the<00:02:01.320> ball<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> same<00:02:02.850> time<00:02:03.119> forcing

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the ball and at the same time forcing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.929 
the ball and at the same time forcing
your<00:02:03.899> way<00:02:03.960> into<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.320> penalty<00:02:04.680> area<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.219> pretty

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
your way into the penalty area is pretty

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
your way into the penalty area is pretty
much<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.329> only<00:02:06.600> way<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> play<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.439> him

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
much the only way to play with him

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.050 
much the only way to play with him
unless<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.220> are<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.610> good<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.910> his

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
unless you are pretty good with his

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.029 
unless you are pretty good with his
freestyle<00:02:09.599> skill<00:02:09.869> moves<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> could<00:02:10.770> see

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
freestyle skill moves then I could see

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.820 
freestyle skill moves then I could see
you<00:02:11.190> potentially<00:02:11.760> skilling<00:02:12.660> past<00:02:12.900> defenders

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you potentially skilling past defenders

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.490 
you potentially skilling past defenders
but<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:14.910> thing<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.660> awesome<00:02:16.110> about<00:02:16.320> him

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
but one thing that is awesome about him

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.070 
but one thing that is awesome about him
is<00:02:16.680> he's<00:02:17.610> pretty<00:02:17.970> unique<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.780> don't

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
is he's pretty unique because you don't

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.840 
is he's pretty unique because you don't
find<00:02:19.440> many<00:02:19.950> tool<00:02:20.310> players<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.820> actually

agility if you take that out and if

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.410

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you're not a skill oh definitely

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.170 
you're not a skill oh definitely
recommend<00:02:54.900> him<00:02:55.020> because<00:02:55.290> he's<00:02:55.440> very<00:02:55.530> very

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
recommend him because he's very very

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.970 
recommend him because he's very very
overpowered<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.390> his<00:02:57.660> rating<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.740> don't

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
overpowered for his rating and I don't

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.560 
overpowered for his rating and I don't
think<00:02:59.190> he<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.459> going<00:02:59.730> for<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.300> which<00:03:00.540> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
think he is going for much which is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.890 
think he is going for much which is
another<00:03:01.050> pro<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:01.890> overall<00:03:02.520> he<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> very<00:03:03.630> fun

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
another pro but overall he is a very fun

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.480 
another pro but overall he is a very fun
play<00:03:04.080> tease<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.950> could<00:03:05.100> definitely<00:03:05.250> see
