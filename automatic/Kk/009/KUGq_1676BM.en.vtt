00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.850
 caffeine is known as the most 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.290
 popular of the world they use it all type 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.450
 of people both students 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.820
 drivers and workers because of their 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.950
 surprisingly stimulating effects 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.480
 It has also become very popular in 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.210
 athletes and in the world of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.100
 muscle training today we will talk about everything from 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.780
 this product caffeine and from a 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.730
 fitness point of view 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.980
 first of all we will go to the workshop about 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.320
 what is caffeine is caffeine a 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.599
 natural chemical stimulant called tri 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.460
 mission so fine is a drug and in 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.590
 reality shares similar traits with 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.230
 other drugs like amphetamines the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.820
 cocaine and heroin as we know the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.220
 caffeine alters the functioning of the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.470
 nervous system and in effect it gives us a 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.660
 feeling of energy is 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.510
 naturally in more than 60 plants 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.970
 including coffee beans tea leaves 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.010
 cola nuts and cocoa beans 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.050
 so it is in a wide 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.120
 range of foods to understand how 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.610
 caffeine works we have to understand 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.559
 adenosine you hardly wake up a 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.590
 molecule called adenosine accumulates 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.689
 slowly in your brain this joins 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.800
 the receptor cells of the brain to 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.170
 calm activities 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.270
 central nervous system among more 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.520
 adenosine accumulates more tired it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.740
 will feel your brain so the more 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.500
 time stay awake more tired 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.060
 you will feel on the other side when you sleep 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.950
 the opposite happens the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.930
 Adenosine concentration starts at 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.540
 go down slowly promoting it to you 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.640
 wake up surprisingly caffeine 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.490
 has a structure similar to that of the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.650
 adenosine is basically enters the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.080
 bloodstream to compete with the 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.630
 adenosine receptors such as caffeine 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.030
 is not adenosine the sleep effect is not 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.950
 feels so in other words the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.900
 Caffeine works because it blocks and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.790
 delays the feeling of sleep like 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.260
 we know caffeine not only removes the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.300
 dream but it has a lot 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.280
 of health benefits as 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.320
 example improve memory the feeling 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.180
 alert the reaction time the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.850
 feeling of well - being and many others 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.170
 but better monkeys base on caffeine and the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.510
 fitness which is what we really 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.460
 interesting as we know caffeine the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
 they use a lot of athletes and it's 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.240
 because it helps increase the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.250
 sports performance in a studio is 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.050
 showed that caffeine helps improve 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.620
 the maximum repetition in the press of 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.750
 banking 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.879
 muscular endurance in general in 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.159
 another study found that subjects who 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.080
 had taken caffeine they were able to 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.209
 do more repetitions with the same weight 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 in comparison to those who took the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.170
 placebo there is also evidence that the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.510
 Caffeine can increase tolerance 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.700
 pain and therefore you can train with 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.810
 more intensity in your workouts 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.489
 this is because caffeine 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.370
 increases the production of adrenaline 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.860
 in a study it was found that subjects 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.090
 who took caffeine experienced less 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.519
 pain that the subjects who took 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.920
 aspirin and a placebo after doing 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.739
 extensions of leg and curl of biceps 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.260
 also the caffeine allowed the subjects 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.599
 to do more repetitions and feel less 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.790
 pain another effect that sure you 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.769
 interesting about caffeine is its effect 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.329
 fat-burning if you 've noticed great 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.340
 quantity of products that more fat 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.500
 they contain large amounts of caffeine 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.629
 this is because caffeine increases 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.370
 both the lipolysis that refers to the 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.470
 breakdown of fats as 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.569
 thermogenesis that refers to burning 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.849
 of calories so if you have a little bit of 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.709
 rebellious fat then tried to take 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.959
 about 200 grams of caffeine before 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.250
 train this would be an equivalent to 3 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.540
 Cups of coffee 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.370
 this is always linked to your 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.140
 needs and what you are capable of 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.080
 tolerate so there is not a dose 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.570
 definitively recommended caffeine is 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.480
 safe however it can be dangerous 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.860
 when consumed in high doses 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 especially during long periods of 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.660
 time our recommendation is to be 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.550
 a great supplement to boost your 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.440
 results in the gym calisthenics 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.450
 the power lifting or any other 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.030
 we are in a sport next time 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.300
 and as the phrase that follows the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.300
 madness
