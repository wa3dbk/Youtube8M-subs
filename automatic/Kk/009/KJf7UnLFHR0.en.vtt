00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 the occurrence finds today no 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 not to talk about thieves obviously 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 that a class that I love 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.869
 personally how I like it 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 but I love the gameplay style but 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.900
 to talk a bit about what you see 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.860
 in front of the flying rocks and you in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.660
 do it's riddles you're jumping 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.079
 puzzle that's called that and so actually 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 we will have to start from a how to say 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 of a point for example so here that in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.160
 down the tree a point with who is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 find there so final finish and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 at the end we unlock a chest 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.190
 that I have already opened since I come from 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.740
 do it now right now the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.810
 hedge 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.640
 and so we will do it together 13 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.560
 years the jumping puzzle is here so 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 at forest de calais gives it's just at 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.880
 north of the grove so the group renÃ©e 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.280
 wide of lyon you arrive at the grove in 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.870
 only two minutes walk there is 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.980
 what are you doing here? I take advantage of this 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.930
 silly to talk a little bit of a 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.290
 subject that usually it must be a 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.760
 about 80% the population of the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.640
 population my youtube community 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.310

 joel and tree trunks and frankly 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.739
 I made the panoply course kia de 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.540
 hydraulic matic mechanical electricity 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.880
 electronics all that all frankly 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.709
 I really reached so knowing 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.540
 I did my courses 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.010
 of electronics is that just had the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.870
 even frankly it was great 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 spent a good it 's only two hours of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.299
 course in September it's officially 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.220
 match begins with electricity 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.090
 live in the lab more sure they will 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.890
 still ask us to do a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.500
 sheet are a class of 100 students I 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.510
 pass from a class of four students into 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.519
 blood class and efs 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.010
 it's hot when I tell you not and 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.920
 Here corner judith me because 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.480
 how was your entry 1 so 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.299
 obviously avoid criticizing the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.130
 others and a wrist to dream here we have a 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.450
 little chest so I was open 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.910
 just two seconds ago a world there 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 wins that slab frankly I win a 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.530
 shield here mighty shield or 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.090
 frankly useful and a gem I do not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.910
 remember I never said in my 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.230
 chest are worth the young so voila 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.250
 here I am I came here I saw 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.930
 that they still had a small path 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.310
 by that what I saw so here is 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.850
 so we'll do it together I do not know 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.850
 not if there is something 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.360
 will you be able to 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.849
 which one is actually another 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.870
 hidden chest is at the gala 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.610
 great organs 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.739
 I can not find her anymore I'm going 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.780
 take a break from the time to find her 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.730
 I think it's in here so we get 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.400
 find once I'll be and so 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.430
 we're back and we're finally here 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.109
 it's right here next to the heart 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.479
 seems like it has it so 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.759
 the organ is here and if there is a clam 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.360
 in fact it will play a certain 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.170
 number of two 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 I do not know what it's called 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.270
 zorc the order and that will open the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:42.130
 clam 1 so be careful that spoil if 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.860
 you want to find out for yourself 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.780
 do not look at the sequel in the heart 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.960
 big here we have to make 2 3 4 5 for 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.850
 pass on four three two prove that 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.970
 the sun shines by car type on two 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.630
 years of my form 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.289
 1-1 of gold exchange 2006 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.550
 There you go 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.960
 a little music all that not good the 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.960
 formwork was opened and his parents 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.470
 here's formwork was opened 20 I 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.740
 always found green so it's a 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.740
 little boring 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.610
 so here they are, if they type the ltte 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.610
 secret of 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.390
 of this card I do not think there is any 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.120
 other 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.860
 finally it's already my little idea size 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.050
 of the game that make that I honestly 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.790
 excellent what so that exploration 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.710
 which is a crucial point I find in 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.210
 guild wars 2 there frankly I find 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.190
 that it's perfect when I discovered 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.090
 that frankly I was amazed good it's 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.190
 not me who found the handcuffs to 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.950
 jeffrey on skirts with geniuses of the 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.320
 music no more and voila 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.670
 Besides, I do not even know if two 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.390
 clues to find that hour down 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:59.760
 it's crazy like doing what 2.3 and 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:02.730
 15,3 of 2,3 to other forms aa2 I 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.320
 do you know what I did with lazard 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.630
 two shaved heads open a long time ago 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.680
 also finally short here is what and after 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.710
 you can have fun doing my 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.710
 music 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.860
 that's what 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.439
 and everyone hears you more than it is 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.969
 not beautiful that's what 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.120
 I hope this invites you 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.379
 plus a little young souza and my 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.289
 comments so how was 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:28.000
 your entry into the mobile game know 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.620
 just see a little that there are some 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.180
 Mist acision started on September 3rd 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.490
 it makes me laugh I started on the 17th 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.669
 go short so we end up for the 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.310
 next little jumping puzzle so I can 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.659
 my character at the same time obviously 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.889
 I forgot to say that that you 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:49.379
 unlock to success so 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:51.400
 explorer these little successes enough 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.409
 enough where we ask ourselves questions in 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.750
 made success of puzzles and that the sun 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.029
 shine in you it's not that wallace and 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.800
 these are therefore good morgane so 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.990
 that was the time when we were the 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.520
 every title actually allows you to everything 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:09.430
 know or it's for example good death 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.560
 from ian to flat go spiral of morgane 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.699
 you see what basically so there is 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.330
 always a little detail like that 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:17.680
 lets know where that's why 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.610
 so your return for the next 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.400
 cheo video 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.419
 I specified for example here lou 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.419
 anne marie sy too late 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:31.190
 this remark is in fact that the only 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.510
 the spiral of morgane closes in fact 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.060
 when we lose dynamic events 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.220
 who are still and this guy there so 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.840
 brÃ¼gg allows you to reopen that 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:44.090
 you see now I 'm going to turn 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:45.530
 just in time from here so there is 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.090
 will have a dynamic event that will be there 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.900
 it will have to be protected against 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.530
 Undead 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:54.800
 he was bringing back so that kiki who could 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:58.720
 what happen to them so here it is it's 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.720
 a little detail to daddy it pays
