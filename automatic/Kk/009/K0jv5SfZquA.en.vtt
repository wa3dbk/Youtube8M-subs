00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:33.814
A Revenge of Dunces

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:41.281
Once upon a time,
two planets very far away.

00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:45.719
Two different civilizations were
living on these 2 planets.

00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:51.467
Legos used to live on Brick,
in a strict and rationnal world.

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:59.927
They were not very tall but
they were quite good in constructing.

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:05.578
Playmos lived quietly on Geobra,
fishing and hunting to survive

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:08.818
in a world with no violence at all.

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:20.288
They liked skiing on
their land's sandy places.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:25.314
The 2 civilizations were living peacefully
because they had never met each other yet.

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.975
They even ignore the existence
of their neighborhood.

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:34.226
But one day,
an unexpected event occured.

00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:40.707
The mysterious objects were
a huge technological progress

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:44.334
for Playmos who still used
to live in treehouses,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.085
and for Legos too,
more advanced technologically.

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:50.048
The two civilizations quickly
understood the substance of the objects

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.543
and were able to use them.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.017
Legos used it to build
more complicated machines

00:01:57.338 --> 00:02:01.074
to improve productivity
and rate of their constructions.

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.770
So, they naturally discovered slavery.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.420
Playmos didn't follow the same way,

00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:13.613
They had enough to eat on their planet,
and found their houses quite confortable,

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:18.722
so they didn't search to improve
their comfort or productivity.

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.336
The only thing they could find useful
in this technological newness was Art,

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:25.663
especially music.

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:28.794
They came to construct big
machines to make sound,

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.177
and had fun every night
by dancing till dawn.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:43.802
The inhabitants of Brick were
able to build big space ships.

00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.499
They finally discover the nearby planet.

00:02:55.532 --> 00:02:59.796
They found the Playmos were idiots
and decided to slave them.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.142
They could bring them by ship on their planet

00:03:03.387 --> 00:03:06.559
to make them work on the construction
of the Presidential Palace.

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:11.385
Their plan was well on its way when a dispute
arose between the President and Vice President.

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:13.886
It was about the funding of the Palace.

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:16.634
Vice President insulted the President,

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:18.538
the President took him a slap,

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:20.826
Vice President replied with a kick,

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.220
President had the last word...

00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:40.807
It was the end of the Brick planet
and Legos nation.
