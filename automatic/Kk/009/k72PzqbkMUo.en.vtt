00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.030 

yeah<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.270> was<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> shock<00:02:27.960> when<00:02:28.260> she

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
yeah it was a bit of a shock when she

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.520 
yeah it was a bit of a shock when she
not<00:02:29.190> used<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.510> was<00:02:30.660> good<00:02:30.810> feeling<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
not used to it was good feeling that and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.430 
not used to it was good feeling that and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.300 

massive<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.530> think<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:53.140> mean<00:02:54.140> we<00:02:54.830> had<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> meeting

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
massive I think I mean we had a meeting

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.960 
massive I think I mean we had a meeting
tonight<00:02:55.459> about<00:02:56.230> about<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.349> squads<00:02:57.650> and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
tonight about about the squads and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.160 
tonight about about the squads and
coaches<00:02:58.970> were<00:02:59.090> saying<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.480> us<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.989> named

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
coaches were saying to us they named

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.690 
coaches were saying to us they named
this<00:03:00.379> the<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.980> England<00:03:01.190> squad<00:03:01.340> from<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
this the the England squad from the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.589 
this the the England squad from the
Montenegro<00:03:02.269> team<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:04.220> think<00:03:04.250> they<00:03:05.090> said

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
Montenegro team and I think they said

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.539 
Montenegro team and I think they said
that<00:03:05.750> only<00:03:05.840> two<00:03:06.110> out<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.739> our<00:03:06.860> squad<00:03:07.129> had<00:03:07.280> not

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
that only two out of our squad had not

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.240 
that only two out of our squad had not
been<00:03:07.790> through<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.450> under-21<00:03:09.049> system<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.950> I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
been through the under-21 system so I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.699 
been through the under-21 system so I
think<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:11.360> vital<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.260> know<00:03:12.410> getting<00:03:12.680> to

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
think it is vital you know getting to

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.130 
think it is vital you know getting to
unlearn<00:03:13.069> experience<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.450> under-21<00:03:14.989> so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
unlearn experience and the under-21 so

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.050 
unlearn experience and the under-21 so
it's<00:03:15.319> not<00:03:15.410> easy<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.250> learn<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> lot<00:03:16.849> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
it's not easy and you learn a lot and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.940 
it's not easy and you learn a lot and
then<00:03:17.209> gives<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> good<00:03:18.110> basis<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.500> push<00:03:18.769> on

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
then gives you a good basis to push on

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.530 
then gives you a good basis to push on
from

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.610 

really<00:03:23.290> good<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:24.450> mean<00:03:25.450> when<00:03:25.599> I<00:03:25.629> when<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.900> want<00:03:26.530> to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
really good I mean when I when I want to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.830

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.960 
got up and I choked a bit to be fair my
mouth<00:03:55.329> went<00:03:55.569> dry<00:03:55.659> and<00:03:56.109> I<00:03:56.920> struggled<00:03:57.609> but<00:03:57.730> I

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
mouth went dry and I struggled but I

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.849 
mouth went dry and I struggled but I
pulled<00:03:58.359> four<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.750> cool<00:03:59.140> bat<00:03:59.319> pretty<00:03:59.650> good

of<00:04:06.760> those<00:04:06.909> songs<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.569> everyone<00:04:07.750> knows<00:04:08.109> and

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
of those songs that everyone knows and

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.199 
of those songs that everyone knows and
can<00:04:08.650> relate<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.159> so<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.549> was<00:04:09.670> my<00:04:09.760> first<00:04:09.940> one

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
