right down here on the the corner there

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
right down here on the the corner there
that<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.309> took<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.670> nice<00:00:59.850> little

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that it really took a nice little

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.969 
that it really took a nice little
beating<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.180> top<00:01:03.180> side<00:01:03.449> here

beating you know on the top side here

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
beating you know on the top side here
from<00:01:04.979> its<00:01:05.220> second<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.420> tumble

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
from its second you know a little tumble

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
from its second you know a little tumble
and<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.740> bet<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.070> probably<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and I bet I could probably take like a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
and I bet I could probably take like a
Sharpie<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.150> something<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.630> colored<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
Sharpie or something in colored in if it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.679 
Sharpie or something in colored in if it
was<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.890> bothering<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.540> more

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
was really bothering me but a lot more

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210 
was really bothering me but a lot more
damage<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> frame<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.100> have

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
damage on the frame then I would have

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
damage on the frame then I would have
thought<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> would<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.030> let's<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:15.869> ahead
