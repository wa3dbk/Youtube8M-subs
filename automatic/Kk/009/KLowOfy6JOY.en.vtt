00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
okay is the GCR and I'm building for a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.990 
okay is the GCR and I'm building for a
customer<00:00:13.160> fairly<00:00:14.160> local<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> me<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.759> guess

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
customer fairly local to me I guess

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.800 
customer fairly local to me I guess
about<00:00:16.340> 60<00:00:17.340> miles<00:00:17.550> away<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.630> almost

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
about 60 miles away so it's almost

nice with my custom engine mount and we

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.800 
nice with my custom engine mount and we
twist<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.610> there<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.630> see

that<00:03:18.840> it's<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> nice<00:03:19.829> detail<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:22.140> I'll<00:03:22.260> leave

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
that it's a nice detail so I'll leave

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.630 
that it's a nice detail so I'll leave
you<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:23.010> look<00:03:23.130> out<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.519> minute

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
you with this to look out for a minute

you with this to look out for a minute
next<00:03:24.030> time<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> get<00:03:24.480> into<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.870> know<00:03:25.170> I'll

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
next time I get into this you know I'll

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.170 
next time I get into this you know I'll
be<00:03:25.620> outside<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.489> probably<00:03:26.640> hear<00:03:27.000> it

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
be outside so you can probably hear it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.720 
be outside so you can probably hear it
and<00:03:27.269> I'll<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.570> few<00:03:27.750> more<00:03:27.930> bits<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.260> pieces

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
and I'll do a few more bits and pieces

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.600 
and I'll do a few more bits and pieces
but<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:30.920> generally<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:32.070> we<00:03:32.190> get<00:03:32.340> some<00:03:32.489> of

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
but just generally one we get some of

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.590 
but just generally one we get some of
this<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:34.519> video<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.940> my<00:03:36.060> little<00:03:36.269> camera
