00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 well as I am 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 whether you are with young people now 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.460
 So you want to work with children or 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 with adolescent adult or old 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 if you have a psychic area kindes 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.109
 or mentally impaired 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.090
 people that is wide-ranging the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.589
 there are special school health education 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 here at the helene engelbrecht school 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.420
 for more than ten years and that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 Of course, that means we have a certain amount 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.510
 have experience on the one hand and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.200
 certain contacts with ours 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.390
 cooperation partners 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.890
 We take care of the very good and where you are 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.469
 also a certain reliability 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.939
 Meanwhile, the teachers made 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.490
 yes, everyone comes from practice 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.899
 also already practice experience and the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.259
 can be very good at the learning content 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.560
 mediate and take but also like 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.569
 to have suggestions for improvement 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.039
 concepts schramm förder planning and 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.429
 I would not have learned this here then 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.340
 I would have a problem now too 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.039
 The theory lessons are important spontaneously 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.299
 I remember that join in here 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.950
 is desired 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.599
 if communicative if open 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.250
 can provide and what the legs 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.750
 can it have already said then 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.270
 can you do this too? 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.799
 we swap and we take too 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.020
 all notes from the students 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.610
 really serious it is not always possible 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.470
 implement all hear the student 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.489
 really 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.020
 and I think that's a big one 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.280
 Advantage I have it myself as 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.459
 do not know students 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.440
 it is just city ​​marl you can with bus 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.200
 and train very good 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.390
 you can just quickly over the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.510
 Supermarket get something in the break 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.430

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.800
 head for tim classmate meet 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.810
 really nice to work with people 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 often funny even if worse 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.640
 franken does not do it hard and me 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.709
 but not many people know that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.209
 can not be as funny the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.629
 We are doing the same as the nurturing nurses
