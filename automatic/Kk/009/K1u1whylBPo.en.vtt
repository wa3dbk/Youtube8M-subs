little too long so I figured I'd render

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.240 
little too long so I figured I'd render
it<00:02:47.570> out<00:02:47.660> send<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> guy<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:48.980> for

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
it out send it to the guy that it's for

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640 
it out send it to the guy that it's for
and<00:02:49.489> kind<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.820> get<00:02:50.000> his<00:02:50.269> feel<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:50.870> how<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.410> looks

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650
