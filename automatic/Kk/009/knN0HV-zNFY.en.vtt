00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.410
 another video 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.740
 Today I have a lot of videos 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.599
 for example, this maybe out here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.639
 you know the little really cool 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.770
 toy if you do not even 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.810
 may call toys 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.750
 rome is already in the second 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 version outside 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.560
 and I'll show you now like that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.689
 your windows computer respectively 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.830
 naturally better off in the laptop 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.390
 so that you can get out of it 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.640
 So you can control with the joystick 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 example would actually have us one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.550
 drone with two cameras one man 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.950
 actually only via smartphone or 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.879
 can control the tablet so 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.800
 works only on the mobile 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.500
 operating system like android resp 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:58.559
 ios not so with this great program 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 this is a program where 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.270
 have assembled and see here with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.659
 then here, for example, a valium 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.520
 artificial horizon is called that there 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.689
 you are just like the location of the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 Rohde is so if she just cant in the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.770
 space is whether to forward or 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 the back is tilted to the compass 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 we can really see the number of degrees 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.659
 means we can we know that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.799
 now that north can fly then 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.090
 We really look to the north 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.189
 fly this is here 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 we see how fast and how tall you are 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.259
 is when you see how high she wears yes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.810
 it's really great 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.960
 also you can under input settings 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.820
 then would truly a 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 a the case of a wireless controller 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.090
 then with joystick select and can 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.910
 also do not say which button then to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.400
 take off for automated start to 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.760
 automated landing can be used 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.970
 should 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.990
 There is a lot of button that is then 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.640
 really there for that just everything 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.850
 That's when you somehow 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.979
 just has no control or the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.260
 then just on the pond to fly 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.380
 you press the button and the thing pops 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.600
 But that usually lasts from Europe 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.910
 is the function that he tries then 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.020
 always have to stay there 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.340
 not do anything more and the thing 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.620
 always tries to stop there and 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.970
 when it to such a thing 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.850
 looks at a camera looks at the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 object looks to the camera then 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.570
 you can also click on and you have 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 all the time in sight 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.260
 besides , you can trim a bit 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.090
 and then there is the special action 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.480
 that can be the 2 then can 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.190
 example, rollovers and so I saw 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.530
 I do not have any more here I am 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.670
 bought a self that was the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.430
 headlines i was still in the beta phase 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.890
 but unfortunately it is already here 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.660
 broken and that's why I can unfortunately 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.880
 do not demonstrate I can tell you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.420
 I've previously used by that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.940
 best free free 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.770
 controller program for windows and what 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.760
 There is no better and it 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.510
 I can do it for you 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.520
 to guarantee 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.050
 You then start here when you start 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.010
 that opens then already concrete 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.250
 throne 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.440
 important is of course you have to wifi 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.959
 to be connected to the drone the drone 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.920
 yes makes a wifi network and there 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.250
 you have to be with the computer 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.959
 and then you start staring 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.090
 moral and that recognizes it automatically and 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.790
 connects to the drone course 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.980
 there are also other settings the ip 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.760
 address to the name but he finds 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.120
 mostly automated out when starting 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.340
 good because thorn and left is mine 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.640
 Freyung is to media celebration left her 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.030
 I need net framework for that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.459
 Hope you have that if you do not have to 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.870
 you still download this and then 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.510
 you get download and then you get 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.880
 her a zip archive this room wrong 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.970
 then looks like here you go easy 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.829
 in adrian newey and starts here 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.810
 Real then you have a short 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.239
 wait this surface and can already 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.989
 start with the states and can have fun 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:18.200
 Of course , the range is also 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.479
 limited however there is great usb wlan 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.750
 cards I got myself a 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.419
 the second and mother also took one 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.330
 radio antennas and thus one creates 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.560
 then the 150 meters 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.840
 because a computer is really easy 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.440
 has more power and this usb wlan 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.300
 cards the extra it neither the extra 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.160
 are made for a long time yet 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.460
 function 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.870
 In any case, they will create more and more 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.850
 then it's really fun and you can 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.789
 The drone is sitting outside in here 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.110
 here of course has a live image so 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.400
 you can also see everything from the camera 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.020
 You can see yourself up in the corner 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.380
 even the bottom camera show 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.390
 to let 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.640
 you can even view objects 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.200
 let's say follow this 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.729
 Persons tracking is trying the program 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.940
 to track this person 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.919
 there are warnings in front of circle so if 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.770
 one flies too close to objects edge 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.420
 what is it really bad about that right 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.680
 That's it for me, too 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.140
 and see you at the next video 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.350
 and I hope that I have you on 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.350
 helped
