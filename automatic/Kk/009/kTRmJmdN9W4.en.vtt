00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790 
squeeze the end of the neck until you
flatten<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> once<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> flatten<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
out you're just going to attach it to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.500 
out you're just going to attach it to
the<00:00:48.539> body<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:50.059> after<00:00:51.059> you've<00:00:51.210> attached

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the body like so after you've attached

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.000 
the body like so after you've attached
it<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> their<00:00:51.930> body<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it to their body you're just going to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
it to their body you're just going to
take<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.340> blade<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.610> cut<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.300> any<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
take your blade and cut off any of the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
take your blade and cut off any of the
excess<00:00:55.110> clay<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.710> once<00:00:56.370> you've<00:00:56.520> done<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
excess clay and once you've done that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299 
excess clay and once you've done that
you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.090> blend<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.690> fingers<00:00:58.309> after

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you can blend it with your fingers after

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.619 
you can blend it with your fingers after
you've<00:00:59.399> blended<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.850> with<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.090> fingers<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
you've blended it with your fingers it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.939 
you've blended it with your fingers it
should<00:01:00.809> look<00:01:00.989> something<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
should look something like this

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
should look something like this
and<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.180> take<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.750> clay<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and now you can take some more clay and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.280 
and now you can take some more clay and
make<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> tail<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.510> roll<00:01:06.720> piece<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> clay

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
make the tail so just roll piece of clay

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.660 
make the tail so just roll piece of clay
between<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.710> fingers<00:01:08.010> until<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.580> a

between your fingers until you have a
pointed<00:01:09.060> coil<00:01:09.390> shape<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.280> bend<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pointed coil shape like this bend it a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.310 
pointed coil shape like this bend it a
little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> begin<00:01:12.540> flattening<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
little bit and begin flattening the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
little bit and begin flattening the
other<00:01:13.530> end<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> clay<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.000> did

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
other end of the clay just like we did

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.539 
other end of the clay just like we did
with<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> neck<00:01:15.890> once<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> flattens<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
with the neck once you flattens out the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.730 
with the neck once you flattens out the
tail<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.299> attach<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> dinosaur

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
