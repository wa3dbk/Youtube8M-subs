00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.190 

I<00:00:39.400> thought<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.120> was<00:00:40.240> great<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.630> Belmont<00:00:40.990> show

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
I thought it was great the Belmont show

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.190 
I thought it was great the Belmont show
since<00:00:42.010> he<00:00:42.280> has<00:00:42.550> been<00:00:42.790> doing<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.270> has<00:00:43.990> had<00:00:44.170> a

since he has been doing it has had a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.830 
since he has been doing it has had a
great<00:00:44.620> spirit<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.430> I<00:00:45.850> think<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.300> fun<00:00:46.510> part

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
great spirit and I think the fun part

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.690 
great spirit and I think the fun part
has<00:00:46.990> been<00:00:47.200> you<00:00:47.770> know<00:00:47.800> obviously<00:00:48.490> he's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
has been you know obviously he's

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.090 
has been you know obviously he's
appropriating<00:00:49.450> other<00:00:49.720> time<00:00:50.140> zones<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.830> going

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
appropriating other time zones and going

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.830 
appropriating other time zones and going
in<00:00:51.250> there<00:00:51.490> and<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:52.030> think<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.390> fact<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.720> he

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
in there and I think the fact that he

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.410 
in there and I think the fact that he
did<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.110> Frank<00:00:53.350> Sinatra<00:00:53.790> song<00:00:54.790> saying<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.270> did

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900

great moment sort of in mid to late 20th
century<00:01:05.020> history<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.130> then<00:01:06.610> really<00:01:07.090> giving

neo surrealism neo Expressionism were

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.910 
neo surrealism neo Expressionism were
taking<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.870> eras<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.680> really

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
taking these eras that they really

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.860 
taking these eras that they really
believed<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.910> giving<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> completely

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
believed in and giving it completely

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.719 
believed in and giving it completely
contemporary<00:01:37.260> spin<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.580> he's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
contemporary spin and that's what he's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.330 
contemporary spin and that's what he's
doing<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.210> openly<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.800> think<00:01:41.190> it's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

emotion and energy on the runway I think

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.240

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.490 

and<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.150> curious<00:04:38.389> thing<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.780> sure<00:04:39.139> this<00:04:39.319> is

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
and the curious thing is sure this is

really potable to a punk

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.710 
really potable to a punk

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
and so the t-shirt or Bobby sell for

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.270 
and so the t-shirt or Bobby sell for
about<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.930> thousand<00:04:45.410> dollars<00:04:45.740> or<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:46.039> jeans

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
about a thousand dollars or the jeans

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.670 
about a thousand dollars or the jeans
will<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.550> about<00:04:46.729> two<00:04:47.090> thousand<00:04:47.599> dollars<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.229> I

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.339 
will be about two thousand dollars and I
don't<00:04:48.740> like<00:04:49.099> to<00:04:49.280> speculate<00:04:49.639> just<00:04:50.150> how<00:04:50.690> costly

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
don't like to speculate just how costly

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:57.890 
don't like to speculate just how costly
those<00:04:52.069> leather<00:04:52.400> jackets<00:04:52.880> will<00:04:53.090> be

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.120 

well<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.380> think<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.710> gonna<00:04:58.830> be<00:04:58.950> interesting

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
well I think it's gonna be interesting

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.500 
well I think it's gonna be interesting
to<00:04:59.340> see<00:04:59.460> what<00:04:59.670> he<00:04:59.730> does<00:04:59.760> in<00:05:00.120> terms<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.420> the

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
to see what he does in terms of the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.850 
to see what he does in terms of the
prices<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:00.900> think<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.140> leather<00:05:01.320> jackets<00:05:01.770> you

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
prices I think the leather jackets you

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.530 
prices I think the leather jackets you
can<00:05:01.890> totally<00:05:02.280> justified<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:02.970> I<00:05:03.000> don't<00:05:03.390> know

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
can totally justified it I don't know

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.910 
can totally justified it I don't know
what<00:05:03.840> he's<00:05:03.960> gonna<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.260> with<00:05:04.440> me<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.800> those

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
what he's gonna do with me some of those

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.740 
what he's gonna do with me some of those
leather<00:05:05.100> skirts<00:05:05.520> with<00:05:05.730> say<00:05:06.330> chickens<00:05:06.630> all

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
leather skirts with say chickens all

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.120 
leather skirts with say chickens all
over<00:05:07.020> them<00:05:07.170> were<00:05:07.290> really<00:05:07.500> beautiful<00:05:07.800> and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
over them were really beautiful and

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.550 
over them were really beautiful and
decorated<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:08.790> well<00:05:08.970> done<00:05:09.120> but<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.720> think<00:05:10.290> it's

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
decorated and well done but I think it's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.800 
decorated and well done but I think it's
tough<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:11.010> pair<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.460> cutoff<00:05:11.760> shorts<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.660> know

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
tough a pair of cutoff shorts you know

tough a pair of cutoff shorts you know
any<00:05:13.020> young<00:05:13.320> girl<00:05:13.350> who<00:05:13.770> can<00:05:13.950> wear<00:05:14.100> that<00:05:14.310> look<00:05:14.580> is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
any young girl who can wear that look is

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.310 
any young girl who can wear that look is
going<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.180> do<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.390> herself<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:15.930> figure<00:05:16.170> out<00:05:16.230> a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
going to do it herself and figure out a

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:33.860 
going to do it herself and figure out a
way<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.530> duplicate<00:05:17.250> it

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.930 

well<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.530> think<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:35.100> bowel<00:05:35.250> mound<00:05:35.550> devotees

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.909 
well I think the bowel mound devotees
and<00:05:36.600> there's<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:36.990> lot<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.290> them<00:05:37.440> with<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.680> lot<00:05:37.889> of

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
money will certainly buy into it but the

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.860 
money will certainly buy into it but the
