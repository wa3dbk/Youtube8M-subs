00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.710
 wood provides cozy warmth of the 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.020
 fuel from local forests is 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.390
 climate-friendly and cheap a few 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.790
 Tips help to maximize the heat 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.790
 win and minimize pollutants 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 for the air supply before the light the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.529
 air and throttle open all the way around 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 quickly reach high temperatures 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.650
 it's best to ignite the fire from above 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 At first the wood loosely in the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.970
 combustion chamber plain pressed 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.850
 wood briquettes are best issued in 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.239
 pieces and gives you enough space 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.239
 expansion 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.449
 are help for example, wood wool 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.030
 pile up on top of the fuel 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.809
 placed over it you cross small 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.809
 wood chips 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 the hiring from above appears on the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.590
 first look unusually reduced 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 but significantly the pollutant emissions 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 when cheering to bright quickly 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 high flames and a strong fire 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.869
 form 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 this signals a favorable 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.640
 burn off the adequate air supply is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.860
 therefore crucial for the air and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.500
 Throttle valve close only when 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.100
 a beautiful blood stick has formed during 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.350
 refill the air supply again 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.179
 for an optimal heat gain is the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.960
 water content of the wood of great 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.049
 meaning 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.640
 ideal is a water content of 15 to 20 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.319
 percent 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.390
 Moist wood forms when burning 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:57.060
 more smoke and less heat 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.340
 It is banned from plastic and plastic 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 to burn treated old wood 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.709
 also cause carton and paper when 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 cheer up pollutants of the garbage 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.299
 Burning pollutes the environment 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.210
 toxic substances endanger these 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:15.370
 health and harm oven and fireplace 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.310
 for a safe operation of the oven 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.720
 clean and maintain regularly 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.000
 Soot deposits also reduce the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.360
 heat output and therefore always belong 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.900
 disposed of remotely belong to old ones 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080
 furnaces 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.110
 they consume a lot of fuel and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.450
 cause high particulate matter emissions 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.970
 Modern ovens are economical to produce 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.580
 Low pollutants and provide more heat 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.760
 We especially recommend pellets 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.960
 Tile and fireplace with automatic 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.960
 rules to cheer 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.720
 who heats properly burns dry 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.630
 wood and fire from above 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.720
 bright high flames and white or 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.000
 light gray ashes are signs for that 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.890
 the best possible utilization of the fuel 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.110
 becomes 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.150
 so wood is a thrifty and 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.150
 climate friendly heat source
