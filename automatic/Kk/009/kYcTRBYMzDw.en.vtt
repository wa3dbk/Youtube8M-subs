00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.300
 1 at landing bone howu 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.680
 Landing at 1 at a point that is prone to failure and remembering that it is easy to return even before remembering the Fakey 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.680
 How 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:28.920
 It is turning, but speaking of this clockwise rotation while it can not be landed 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:36.920
 When landing, the body is often tilted to the right 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 Another point is that the rotation is about 170 degrees but it is not enough 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.570
 This is when I went to turn the palace 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.630
 Pull the pedal to yourself with your back foot 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.170
 Previously the department and tires than my ass 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.170
 It is important to bring it up to about 10090 degrees 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.900
 Ah 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.760
 Barn 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 Wearing a 90-degree turn, knees are bent and stretched as if the company stand only lays on landing 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.640
 I think that the handle will also cut naturally if you give it to the return system of the a key already 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.680
 Because it is 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 Even if you can't get a weapon, you can make a t if it can return 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.940
 How do you turn that 20 degrees 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.110
 If you look around the pokey when landing 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.400
 Turn the body angle to the left 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.569
 I think this will change a lot 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.959
 With that 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:26.280
 At knee landing, bend the knee, pull back and turn the crank backward 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:34.580
 This area is important too , but I will return soon or keep on average 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.580
 How to use the waist is important because it can not enter the next movement when the knee is extended and landed 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.430
 eh
