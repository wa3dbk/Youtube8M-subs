00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay well this is our BMW mini that

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay well this is our BMW mini that
we're<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.570> right<00:00:03.720> now<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.200> as<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:05.009> can<00:00:05.130> see<00:00:05.190> we

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
we're in right now and as you can see we

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.789 
we're in right now and as you can see we
have<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.029> EBS<00:00:06.480> warning<00:00:07.259> light<00:00:07.410> showing<00:00:07.620> on

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
have the EBS warning light showing on

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.240 
have the EBS warning light showing on
our<00:00:07.919> dashboard<00:00:09.740> what<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.099> is

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
our dashboard what we're going to do is

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.390 
our dashboard what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> diagnose<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
we're going to diagnose it with the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.560 
we're going to diagnose it with the
c-110<00:00:14.400> scan<00:00:15.120> tool<00:00:16.940> I'm<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.210> find<00:00:18.420> out

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
c-110 scan tool I'm going to find out

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.939 
c-110 scan tool I'm going to find out
what<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> problem<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.770> go<00:00:19.920> ahead

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
what the problem is so we can go ahead

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.740 
what the problem is so we can go ahead
and<00:00:20.250> change<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.580> hoping<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.359> something

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
and change it hoping it's just something

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.410 
and change it hoping it's just something
like<00:00:21.869> an<00:00:22.020> ABS<00:00:22.380> sensor<00:00:22.850> which<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:23.880> pretty<00:00:24.210> easy

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
like an ABS sensor which is pretty easy

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.170 
like an ABS sensor which is pretty easy
and<00:00:24.660> pretty<00:00:24.689> cheap<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.199> replace<00:00:25.880> but<00:00:26.880> we'll<00:00:27.029> go

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
and pretty cheap to replace but we'll go

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.750 
and pretty cheap to replace but we'll go
in<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.449> we'll<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> diagnosis<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.340> any<00:00:29.490> case

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
in and we'll get a diagnosis in any case

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.030 
in and we'll get a diagnosis in any case
so<00:00:30.359> we're<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> mini<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> c-110

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so we're in a mini right now the c-110

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.799 
so we're in a mini right now the c-110
scan<00:00:35.579> tool<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> available<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.329> by<00:00:36.570> clicking

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
scan tool is available just by clicking

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.340 
scan tool is available just by clicking
the<00:00:37.020> link<00:00:37.200> directly<00:00:37.649> below<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> video<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.350> we

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the link directly below this video so we

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
the link directly below this video so we
need<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.800> chassis<00:00:41.190> section<00:00:42.110> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
need to be in this chassis section and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.490 
need to be in this chassis section and
it's<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> ABS<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:45.110> we<00:00:46.110> need<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> find<00:00:48.500> so

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it's the ABS that we need to find so

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750 
it's the ABS that we need to find so
it's<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> communicate<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> ABS

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's going to communicate with the ABS

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.470 
it's going to communicate with the ABS
system<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> read<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
system and then we're go and read the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
system and then we're go and read the
fault<00:00:54.719> codes<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.289> should<00:00:55.500> give<00:00:55.710> us<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
fault codes and it should give us a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.569 
fault codes and it should give us a
particular<00:00:56.370> code<00:00:57.920> which<00:00:58.920> will<00:00:59.129> allow<00:00:59.340> us<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
particular code which will allow us to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:20.050 
particular code which will allow us to
find<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> problem<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.980 

right<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.450> Reid<00:01:21.870> trouble<00:01:22.380> code<00:01:23.810> now<00:01:24.810> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
right so Reid trouble code now it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.090 
right so Reid trouble code now it's
telling<00:01:25.320> us<00:01:25.490> code<00:01:26.690> five<00:01:27.690> Delta<00:01:28.290> Bravo<00:01:28.470> zero

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
telling us code five Delta Bravo zero

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.400 
telling us code five Delta Bravo zero
wheel<00:01:29.580> speed<00:01:30.000> sensor<00:01:30.510> we<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.900> left<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
wheel speed sensor we are left so the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.010 
wheel speed sensor we are left so the
rear<00:01:31.650> left<00:01:32.040> ABS<00:01:32.910> sensor<00:01:33.330> looks<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.900> at

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
rear left ABS sensor looks like it's at

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
rear left ABS sensor looks like it's at
fault<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.580> we're<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.760> to<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.940> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
fault here so what we're going to do is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.730 
fault here so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.479> ahead<00:01:36.600> probably<00:01:37.530> swap

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
we're going to go ahead probably swap

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.780 
we're going to go ahead probably swap
that<00:01:37.920> sensor<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.300> new<00:01:39.509> sensor<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
that sensor out put a new sensor in and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.430 
that sensor out put a new sensor in and
then<00:01:43.460> come<00:01:44.460> back<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.820> reset<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> codes<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
then come back in reset the codes and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.190 
then come back in reset the codes and
that<00:01:46.560> should<00:01:46.920> even<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.340> turn<00:01:47.640> reset<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.330> ABS

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that should even in turn reset the ABS

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.040 
that should even in turn reset the ABS
warning<00:01:49.560> light<00:01:49.710> from<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> dashboard<00:01:50.190> so

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
warning light from the dashboard so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.950 
warning light from the dashboard so
we've<00:01:52.050> got<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.289> wheel<00:01:52.440> off<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.810> if<00:01:54.810> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
we've got the wheel off here and if you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
we've got the wheel off here and if you
look<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.410> cable<00:01:55.830> here<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.300> ABS

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
look at this cable here this is the ABS

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.850 
look at this cable here this is the ABS
sensor<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.410> runs<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:59.100> back<00:01:59.729> here<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
sensor so it runs down back here and

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
sensor so it runs down back here and
into<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> hood<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.899> then

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
into the back of the hood there and then

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.340 
into the back of the hood there and then
they've<00:02:05.880> already<00:02:06.119> unclick<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.840> ABS<00:02:07.140> sensor

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
they've already unclick the ABS sensor

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.130 
they've already unclick the ABS sensor
that<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.489> ABS<00:02:09.030> sensor<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.929> we'll

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that is the ABS sensor there so we'll

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.940 
that is the ABS sensor there so we'll
replace<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:12.360> hopefully<00:02:12.890> three<00:02:13.890> is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
replace that and then hopefully three is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.040 
replace that and then hopefully three is
the<00:02:14.070> colds<00:02:14.400> anime<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.060> warning<00:02:15.330> later

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.930 

okay<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.409> is<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.800> replacement<00:02:21.250> ABS

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
okay so this is the replacement ABS

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.550 
okay so this is the replacement ABS
sensor<00:02:22.360> which<00:02:22.510> we<00:02:22.659> have<00:02:22.840> here<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.379> see

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
sensor which we have here you can see

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.729 
sensor which we have here you can see
the<00:02:24.390> part<00:02:25.390> number<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.110> not<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.349> same<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.680> all

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
the part number it's not the same on all

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.490 
the part number it's not the same on all
vehicles<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:27.489> most<00:02:27.760> minis<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.540> age<00:02:28.720> you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
vehicles but most minis of this age you
