pliocene let's move up to what what
we're<00:04:56.219> going<00:04:56.339> to<00:04:56.429> do<00:04:56.610> in<00:04:56.849> this<00:04:57.300> phase<00:04:57.629> and<00:04:58.139> so

00:04:58.549 --> 00:04:58.559 
we're going to do in this phase and so

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:03.259 
we're going to do in this phase and so
the<00:04:58.979> first<00:05:00.679> seven<00:05:01.679> to<00:05:01.949> ten<00:05:02.550> holes<00:05:02.849> are<00:05:03.149> going

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:03.269 
the first seven to ten holes are going

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:06.169 
the first seven to ten holes are going
to<00:05:03.330> be<00:05:03.479> specifically<00:05:04.229> designed<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.159> test<00:05:05.879> some

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:06.179 
to be specifically designed to test some

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:08.719 
to be specifically designed to test some
of<00:05:06.269> those<00:05:06.360> spaces<00:05:06.749> in<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.289> resource<00:05:08.279> and<00:05:08.580> see

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
of those spaces in the resource and see

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.269 
of those spaces in the resource and see
if<00:05:08.789> we<00:05:08.909> can<00:05:09.059> add<00:05:09.269> to<00:05:09.479> that<00:05:10.009> then<00:05:11.009> we're<00:05:11.189> going

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279 
if we can add to that then we're going

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.939 
if we can add to that then we're going
to<00:05:11.339> move<00:05:11.429> up<00:05:11.789> to<00:05:12.539> this<00:05:12.689> new<00:05:12.959> discovery<00:05:13.139> new

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
to move up to this new discovery new

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.359 
to move up to this new discovery new
north<00:05:14.219> and<00:05:15.050> try<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.110> define<00:05:16.559> or<00:05:16.979> we<00:05:17.159> will

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:17.369 
north and try to define or we will

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:20.119 
north and try to define or we will
define<00:05:17.729> that<00:05:17.969> vein<00:05:18.239> system<00:05:18.749> so<00:05:19.199> this<00:05:19.860> is<00:05:19.979> all

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
define that vein system so this is all

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.209 
define that vein system so this is all
very<00:05:20.159> exciting<00:05:20.879> very<00:05:21.289> exciting<00:05:22.289> stuff<00:05:22.709> that

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
very exciting very exciting stuff that

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.979 
very exciting very exciting stuff that
going<00:05:23.939> to<00:05:23.999> go<00:05:24.089> on<00:05:24.239> this<00:05:24.389> year<00:05:24.629> going<00:05:24.779> to<00:05:24.869> have

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:24.989 
going to go on this year going to have

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:28.609 
going to go on this year going to have
about<00:05:25.110> 40<00:05:25.649> holes<00:05:26.419> we've<00:05:27.419> got<00:05:27.629> one<00:05:28.050> core<00:05:28.379> rig

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:28.619 
about 40 holes we've got one core rig

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:31.189 
about 40 holes we've got one core rig
out<00:05:28.860> now<00:05:29.159> get<00:05:29.729> another<00:05:30.029> co<00:05:30.569> rig<00:05:30.809> in<00:05:30.959> about<00:05:31.169> a

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
out now get another co rig in about a

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.879 
out now get another co rig in about a
month<00:05:31.529> and<00:05:33.169> it<00:05:34.169> should<00:05:34.379> be<00:05:34.559> a<00:05:34.589> very<00:05:34.830> good

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
we're picking the low-hanging fruit

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.929 
we're picking the low-hanging fruit
going<00:05:43.050> all<00:05:43.649> right<00:05:43.919> we<00:05:44.039> zapped<00:05:44.309> into<00:05:44.550> something

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
going all right we zapped into something
