00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 art 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.040
 in 2006 the joyous 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.950
 otherwise not 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.860
 today I have concocted you article reveals femme fatale tour bodvar 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.190
 schramm bad because if we already buy a lot of videos a little bit 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.289
 more natural 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.599
 little later, ten scapegoats left 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.560
 and to be a true femme fatale 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.590
 so I start by applying my base the report on the whole of the 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.819
 eyelid and we do not forget the lower eyelid 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.399
 he then you will need a flesh-colored cream 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.300
 anti head as I show you in the crater palette but also in 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.820
 the smashbox that I showed you just started you have 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.809
 pretty much in all your master palettes that's fine with his looks his 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.190
 coasts whatever the almost composted decided to put the price 

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:49.710
 absolutely reproduce it I use a full-rate color to provide for 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.350
 center and will define hollow words as well a little bit later% and then I will come 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 with a slightly lighter color to really melt the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.399
 remains this line that I created with the instructor brush 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.250
 I come with a little champagne color it's always in the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.550
 semagest bacsinszky not beach flashes past the masterclass tel 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.040
 in the center of the mobile eyelid and then I go back with the first 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.130
 case 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 I do not know how to define it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.870
 about by defining the outside of the eyelid had given as a 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.030
 liquid for the rest is makeup I apply my friend positively 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.580
 to use the one you have it's true that there I wanted to change 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.450
 show you something else always use my opinion the future even to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 angel so this time I changed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.409
 % at the moment I'm using quite a lot that one is very well done 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.790
 I use starts with month after and I'm sorry the sequence was 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.840
 very badly taken but at this time at that time with 1 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.380
 a very very strong brush and I just finished Croatian and then I do not 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.900
 mix ie I'll do it with black always to with a% brush and 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.090
 his father still in my career but I put my actions are very brief 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.560
 extracts 6 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.460
 the restaurant in a context each scored a goal the trend remains 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.660
 bullish with the maximum of trumps and to leave the stadium to be able to 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.980
 create and a nice fade 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.800
 I apply my little light that took place from 8 to 10 August in the room 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.700
 and that the racket 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520
 below society 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720
 finally on the eyebrow arch test at the inner neck of the eye for 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 really the big island 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.649
 and then I will start smoking 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.229
 at the lower eyelid 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.229
 he stung a little I adored in the lower corner 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.420
 and then I have not directly to the application finally the use of the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.420
 Bearish appeal and mascara 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.319
 I did not want to get around one for this video because I think 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.929
 that for a romantic dinner it's amazing but for the video I have 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:55.489
 just refine a little embarrassed and use a bulldozer for the whole 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.949
 of the face simply to warm it to warm up the ground a little bit 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.599
 before applying the blockade to whiten it I used the flash alexis 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.879
 yesterday the scheme that it is a pledge that I like a lot with lille it is 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.209
 Chinese there is practically everything acquired and therefore inevitably I 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.509
 found that he was simply 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.049
 and so I'm going to make a weird head do not worry it's all 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.719
 just that I thought I had a debt in my opinion but it's not 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.339
 serious and I live the fir chain that the scheme too level of the sea 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.289
 for the moment 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:30.589
 a book to deny god my cheekbones a year so it's okay and% of voices and 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.009
 jackson who is really for the video shows that you worry do not miss and 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.129
 we apply the real level of the filmed queen and you also voltaire market 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.379
 equity so I think that's 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.509
 super look 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.969
 when I learned that its color some ships 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.579
 because he likes to work 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.489
 the seat is not the references in mind so I'll put them either on 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.610
 the video is 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.769
 boarding 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.829
 think to look at 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.660
 and after learning that she pencil at the end of l'orÃ©al 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.310
 Thursday she left African where he is just audois and for 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.340
 correct the application because I was too lazy to take 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.160
 a brush to you small lipsticks with equalizer it equals 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.360
 he's really not bad 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.930
 and I live that he likes is easy to 110 blacks this is not a museum denon has 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.930
 just left for the band and for the video I found that his sister 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.459
 Emmanuelle 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.930
 a good land waiting for the dry dock linen jacques simply a 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.060
 little black coffee especially in the outer corner of the eye is a subject 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.060
 well cover the glue of fossils with a little bit of the ordinary 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.840
 remember that it is allowed but I hope to have fun with them that you 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.090
 are going to be beautiful for Valentine's Day and 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.600
 and that you will want to reproduce this moment anyway I loved doing it 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.290
 here is the outfit a little bit that I will leave for valentine's day 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.530
