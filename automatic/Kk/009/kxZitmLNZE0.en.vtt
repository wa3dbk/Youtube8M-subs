 Now always introduce in your video 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.300
 because I have seen everything 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 famous youtuber that open 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 they say hello so i 'm emily 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.779
 Mali and today I do mine 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 autumn morning routine and that are 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.849
 so it always says hello me 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.210
 am funny and now it can only 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 still uphill with the career altogether 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 sure so this is just how it is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.600
 a crazy palaver flop because I am 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 we have seen each other forever I was yes 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.370
 in portugal and you have her too 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.079
 blogs but really face to face 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 somehow we have had face for a long time 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 no longer talked to each other and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.719
 For me it is always so blog 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.860
 It's been a long time since that happened 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.120
 is and I cut that in hindsight 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.440
 and somehow I do not have that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.640
 feel that any connection to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 you understand what I mean 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.260
 that he is as much as you are when you are 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.370
 Something shows what's old as has 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.899
 now completely strange 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.430
 but it is somehow full for me 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.299
 important videos current videos 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.619
 upload 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.900
 so that I feel that I am 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.380
 somehow make conversation with you 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.960
 So that we have an exchange 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.080
 exchange a youtube platform 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.490
 let my army down as well and so 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.320
 That's why I thought I'll do it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 what crazy thing what youtube yet 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 Never saw that it was so innovative 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 people here right from the chair 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.450

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 in november as many videos as possible 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.579
 the youtube world still has high uploads 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 not seen because a beautiful 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.759
 intelligent successful not 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.860
 unthinkable youtube said to me 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.350
 Jacko either you produce 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.280
 youtube bullshit that every pig can see 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.210
 you want or you just make a lot of videos 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.880
 I really have that now 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.130
 the easiest way was chosen I do 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.409
 now a november 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.090
 how innovative it is at the same time 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.039
 easy quantity and bullshit 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.569
 at the same time because it would be me now 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.030
 just really trashy when I am 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.230
 Now this row is really like that if I am 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.030
 because of such a pun with my name 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.430

 I'm not helping so much at the camera 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.300
