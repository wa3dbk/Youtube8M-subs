00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:47.329
 the whiteness 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:50.570

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.609
 nice shine and also a brush 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.120

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:12.180
 complicated with ink is the frog 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.540

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.260

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:38.310
 toothpick on all fingernails 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:42.250
