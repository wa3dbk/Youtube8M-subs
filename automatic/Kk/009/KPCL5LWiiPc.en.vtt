00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.150
 good afternoon my name is vÃ­ctor 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:16.869
 rosales 052 51 this time we are going to 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.720
 see a tutorial to see the parts of 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.180
 the computer first of all we can 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.270
 see the cpu 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.620
 and let's see the hard drives the part 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.910
 of hard disks 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.920
 in the part of here 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.000
 we are going to disarm each part so that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000
 you can observe it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.420
 This machine has two hard drives 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.660
 a skate unit 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.210
 and a rumba itself unit 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.899
 the pieces 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.449
 unit 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.220
 and so much 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.240
 we have ram memory 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 what is the memory of where we lodge the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.610
 information temporarily when it starts 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.610
 to work 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.340
 we have the processor part 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.740
 that is a heat sink that helps 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.910
 that with the processor heats up then 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.910
 can play the 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.510
 the heat 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.420
 this is the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.940
 the central processor here is where it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 process all the information this is a 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.320
 of the most important parts of the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.070
 computer 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.700
 as you can see it has 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.200
 enough SMEs that is where 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.200
 it connects directly 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.379
 we have a d unit 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.500
 power source that is the one that stores 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
 of different electric current 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.840
 voltages all the to the entire computer 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.590
 we have fans that dissipate the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 hot 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.530
 Various power cables 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.349
 information processing they carry 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.290
 from the devices the information 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.709
 to the central processing unit 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.799
 we have a battery that helps us 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.349
 keep certain data such as time and 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.880
 date even if the computer is not 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.450
 connected 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.950
 would be all parts of the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.960
 computer have it completely 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.360
 unarmed 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.910
 on the back of the computer 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:16.030
 we see that it has several outputs from the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.790
 keyboard the monitor you are 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.350
 integrated 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.180
 for printer for the moment 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.640
 then computers come with all 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.740
 the integrated processors while 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.740
 there are some options to put 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.070
 some audio video card is 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.070
 pay 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.450
 Now let's start putting together all the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.209
 pc components of the unit 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.060
 central data processing let's 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.130
 to put the ram 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.000
 you always have to be careful that when 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.000
 RAM is installed we are 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.120
 without static because it can tend to 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.120
 burn memory 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.860
 we make sure it was well priced 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.660
 on a specific side 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.660
 now let's put the bus disks 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.730
 let's make sure with your screws 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.730
 to have already secured the discs 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.370
 we place the cables both 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.370
 common data transfer 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.170
 we see that all the pins enter with 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.470
 carefully so that they are not to 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.470
 Bend 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.310
 As we can see the cables of 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.310
 data transfer are different 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.660
 for example the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.080
 is that it has 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.350
 31 pins which are the pins that are in 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.620
 this part of here are a total of 31 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.620
 kings 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:32.179
 and the cable goes to this side while 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:37.569
 than those of the hard disks and the closing 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:40.600
 They have 41 pins and more thorns 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.729
 and it's technology 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.610
 the technology that is cutting edge s 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.599
 the sat ah but it is a cable completely 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.599
 different from this 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.780
 these are the sata cables 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.120
 they are completely different from those 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.030
 are used now these are transfer the 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.920
 data a little faster are cables 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.420
 much thinner 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.230
 this is the new thing that is being used 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:13.370
 in this case we have and we are going to 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.370
 place the cedar 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.020
 It is placed on your screw 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.020
 what comes out 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.440
 then we will connect your cable 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.849
 always very careful not to bend 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.849
 the pines 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.210
 the power cable 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.849
 completely 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.839
 and now we're going to show you how 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.839
 it would be working
