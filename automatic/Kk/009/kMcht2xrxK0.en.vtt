00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.849
 yokohama switzerland 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 hello christian but just a short time 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 yokohama ago 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.680
 yes hello sabrina thanks for the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.130
 possibility briefly we the brand puma too 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.590
 present yoga is a Japanese 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 tire brand and we are both chambers 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.890
 Switzerland for the whole distribution of the tires 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.410
 do something in switzerland 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.320
 yokohama mature from you can us there 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.620
 bisserl what to say yes so we have 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.020
 a very wide range of tires 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.800
 So from summer to winter tires 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.300
 from small vehicles over 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.449
 compact vehicles middle class all the way 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.260
 to the sports car and suvs and cover there 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 I segment a very big at 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 Vehicles are quite wide 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.030
 with me now is so I'm straight 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 try for winter tires 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.240
 winter is coming and what 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.090
 Would you give me tips on what 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.220
 I have to pay attention to mature so 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 Buy tires now whether summer 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.070
 or winter tires it is important that is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 The right size is always a purchase 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 this size is always ripe 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 specified and also in the car specifically 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.400
 I am actually assigned 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.689
 probably passed in rice 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.890
 and I noticed a number like that 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.960
 I am, however, know my women 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.509
 me with cars and tires not so 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 especially good that the 285 35 r 18 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.220
 95 y 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.799
 what does that say to me as a layman? 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.850
 So that's the whole thing 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.820
 specification actually worldwide 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.659
 applies to the measurement of the rich there 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.200
 start with 285 this is the width of the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.500
 ripe in millimeters so the mature 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 here the example is just 285 mm 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.410
 3 from flank to flank 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 the second number 335 indicates the height 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.340
 that is to say the listening relationship 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.100
 that means the height is 35 percent of 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.010
 the total width so that is in 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.530
 relationship to each other 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.930
 then we have the r18 he stands for 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.850
 Radial that is actually the construction 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.569
 the maturity inside that one sees from 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.989
 I'm not on the outside and then 18 is the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.540
 inch size that's the diameter of the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.530
 rim of the inside of the dane 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.070
 interior actually of maturity 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.060
 then the other two pay 92 and y 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.280
 that's a bit 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.920
 especially motionless but not less 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.970
 important that 92 gives the so-called 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.500
 load index that is how much weight 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:04.390
 I can actually load per tire 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.080
 So out of 92 in this case means 730 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.390
 kilogram 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.459
 that means one tire per tire I can 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.440
 Car driving the 730 kilograms per tire 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.350
 Keep weight on it when you have everything 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.549
 summed up four tires come 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.100
 at just under 2800 kilo so relatively 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.100
 Big heavy car you can with this 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.530
 tires last the last one 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.079
 sign that y actually stands for 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.359
 the so-called speed index that is 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.420
 the speed with which I am with 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.720
 can ride this mature or with the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.100
 car the tires are mounted and y is 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.790
 the highest value 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.120
 that is the mature is designed for 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.130
 kilometer 300 per hour 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.170
 Of course that is always required 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.959
 that you can speed up the rain 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.190
 Thank you for the road 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.480
 detailed interview 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.250
 that's me i think special too 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.250
 when mature thank you
