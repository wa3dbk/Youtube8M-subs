00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
want to buy the same one because I know

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.860 
want to buy the same one because I know
that<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.070> will<00:02:54.190> be<00:02:54.220> compatible<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.180> an<00:02:55.360> SSD

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
that one will be compatible it's an SSD

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.540 
that one will be compatible it's an SSD
hard<00:02:55.900> drive<00:02:56.230> hybrid<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.280> going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.459> have

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
hard drive hybrid so it's going to have

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.670 
hard drive hybrid so it's going to have
performance<00:02:58.239> increases<00:02:58.600> over<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.080> normal<00:02:59.470> hard

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
performance increases over a normal hard

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.990 
performance increases over a normal hard
drive<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.220> you're<00:03:00.370> going<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.520> get<00:03:00.640> loading

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
drive so you're going to get loading

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.670 
drive so you're going to get loading
time<00:03:01.239> benefits<00:03:01.540> there<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.140> yeah<00:03:02.410> basically

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
time benefits there and yeah basically

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.199 
time benefits there and yeah basically
we<00:03:03.130> get<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.400> spend<00:03:03.580> some<00:03:03.670> quality<00:03:03.940> time

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
we get to spend some quality time

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.270 
we get to spend some quality time
together<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.959> you'll<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.680> see<00:03:05.890> me<00:03:06.070> break
