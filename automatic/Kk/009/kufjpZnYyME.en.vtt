 monogatari is a portal to the world of 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.930
 dead since in the summer time of the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.670
 ancient japan when the oppressive heat and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
 the humidity converted any 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.709
 daytime activity in something unbearable the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.380
 people longed for the arrival of night and 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.360
 that between the chorus of frogs and insects the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.819
 people would come together to play the jack or 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.150
 monogatari that translated is the meeting 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.500
 of strange fiftys and so 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.170
 silently the spirits and go 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.780
 returning while nobody knows how 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.940
 it started playing and here monogatari was 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.950
 believes that the samurai did it as 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.290
 courage test to see who was what 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.299
 brave enough to support 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.390
 the stories to play is something 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.970
 complicated because as step 1 should 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.430
 place 100 candles in a circle 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.620
 participants should sit next to 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.050
 the candles and each one tells a story 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.780
 of terror and so on until 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.750
 stories for each story that they tell 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.180
 a candle is extinguished when the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.190
 last candle the portal is supposed to 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.410
 beyond it opens and then the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.350
 spirits can go through it and the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.780
