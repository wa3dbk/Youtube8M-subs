00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.780
 funny 6 senses but fails to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 intercept the rigor of pinilla and it is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.439
 careful they are the only other conclusion 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.830
 of the Sardinians 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.600
 caceres 5 springs in defense too 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 inaccurate in support of the midfield 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 let's hope he becomes martin again 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.470
 of the best times otherwise without 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.860
 chiellini will be pains 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.899
 bonucci 6 to defend especially after 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.399
 the initial disadvantage is little or nothing 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.620
 so he has to work a lot and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.460
 the setting let's say its foot 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.700
 he lived even more inspired evenings with jokes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 if he is left half right for him not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.949
 makes too much difference even if a appears 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.530
 less authoritarian than usual 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.420
 lichtsteiner 6 travels to current 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.829
 alternated and like the rest of the companions 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 misses many steps 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 however it is also among the most lucid vidal 5 lo 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.890
 we absolve for the episode of rigor 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
 procured generous not to say 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 non-existent like the one assigned to us 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 but the umpteenth mistake from the disk is a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.119
 mortal sin regardless of 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.400
 final results 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.479
 for the rest, play a first time 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 anonymous and a crescendo recovery 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.500
 pirlo 6 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 until changed from the possessed 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 opponents midfielders also struggle to 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.590
 then receive the ball when Cagliari 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 He falls accordingly salt but not in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 cathedra and his direction is very good 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 less clean than the usual marchisio if and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.810
 half for long stretches especially in the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.409
 first time is among the few to understand us 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.360
 something 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.259
 and although without acute it brings home the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.439
 usual supply of substance 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.149
 asamoah 5 and a half starts very well but yes 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.520
 he turns off quickly and ends up making a mistake 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.299
 a lot of balloons 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 unlucky in the goal area quagliarella 5 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.920
 plays badly but what turns out more 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.530
 annoying and his attitude almost 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.400
 snob 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.140
 giovinco 6 does not dispute a partitone indeed 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.360
 however it suffers a lot of faults and not 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.280
 demorde mai matri 8 would be naive 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.450
 claim that this doublet cancels 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.819
 the desire for a level tip 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.890
 international that unites a large part 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.599
 of fans, however, what we have seen 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.939
 tonight is exactly what there is 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.510
 a striker would be needed when he is there 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:37.019
 to throw it in , throw it inside 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.819
 padoin 6 is replacing jacks in the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.709
 role of sixth man to use one 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.659
 basketball terminology 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.340
 and indeed when it takes over it always does 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:49.379
 good vucinic if half his entry 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.599
 is one of the components that overturn the 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.519
 race in the last quarter of an hour no more 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.989
 important maybe but the fact remains that 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.269
 with him in the field the danger 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.709
 of the attack increases very much 6 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.420
 evidently they had used the air seen 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.109
 as predicated concentration before 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.329
 of the match 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.159
 regardless of the rigor given to 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.709
 cagliari the juve enters the field to said is 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.180
 concentrated deserving to go under and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.220
 then he struggles even to make himself 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.069
 dangerous until the balances are in eleven 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.750
 of good but besides the result there is from 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.549
 to underline the grit you managed to 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.169
 instill in the group since the umpteenth 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.780
 wrong rigor could be one 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.639
 final punch in we could instead 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.019
 look at the holidays after 2012 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.980
 awesome 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.980
