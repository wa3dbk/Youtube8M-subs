00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.290
 one is called mystic other philosophy 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.940
 but our only philosophy is the bowl 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.949
 this phrase that bora milutinovic coined 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.930
 for the cougars three decades ago 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.430
 sounds incongruous that this tournament 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.320
 the university students have put four 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.480
 goals in 900 minutes 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.150
 the cougar inability to find the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.919
 rival goal begins to be chronic 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.449
 the 13 teams that have remained in 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.789
 first division during the last 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.119
 pumas decade is just above 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.310
 atlas in scoring productivity has 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.100
 445 goals in 10 years and scored less 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.059
 that atlante chiapas morelia and all the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.820
 the rest 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.530
 the production of forwards ended in 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.120
 that time there was a follow-up 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.400
 a follow-up and the tournaments were left 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 to bring that process of maturity 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.010
 in my time they talked about the 80s of you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.880
 on January 6, 1980 the title of agus 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.130
 Sanchez and now stand-in and even Cougars 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.610
 back then when I had covers 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:07.530
 certain positions like the front of 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.440
 suddenly he was hugo his server was coming 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.390
 people taking off strong and lending them to 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.550
 other clubs the pumas forwards 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.100
 they were from a long lineage darling it was 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.960
 replaced by an angle I replace Luis 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.820
 flórez and then others came 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 champions scorers like luis garcia and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 jesus holland 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.250
 well ford was the title of the 90-91 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.830
 where there were nine players made in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 home that season is not only 22 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.729
 years away there are also many 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.440
 goals in that title 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.869
 pumas was the team that scored the most in the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.970
 liga the word quarry referred to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.040
 basic strengths of the university but 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 time worn it ten months ago 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.440
 jorge vantolrá took charge of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 development of young cougars 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.420
 truly urged of results 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.000
 and people can say this two or three 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 tournaments back 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 then the directives in their moments 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.070
 they were more inclined to attract people outside 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.239
 no and well this has been hindered 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.910
 a little bit everything the dynamics that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.190
 he handled pumas in the matter of debuts 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.319
 of young people for me what hurts the most 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.200
 a little bit was the short tournaments 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.239
 the short tournaments to the coaches what 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.069
 What interests them most is to score goals and 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.569
 that do not feed then what is it that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.880
 does with three from abroad you are not going to 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.890
 wait for although a squad that lasts 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.500
 two or three years to give you be 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.030
 effective not at the end of the 90s 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.280
 you more received more money for rights 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.829
 television advertising and selling 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.319
 consequently he had more players 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.870
 Cash for hiring carelessness 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.569
 from the quarry was notorious forgot 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.310
 the training and the views no longer 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.120
 he returned to recruit in the institutions 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.180
 university 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.310
 even in pumitas it was very close on 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.130
 everything when mario velarde also in peace 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 rest memo vázquez 2 formed vázquez 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.730
 part of the academic structure of the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.319
 Unam were working for addiction 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 sports actions and they had to do with 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.340
 the representative team and in turn they were 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.380
 the trainers of the forces 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.880
 basic they were fed in some 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.310
 moment in the university fed 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.960
 of the interfacing events of the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.450
 student elections of the prepas 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.580
 but this began to grow began to have 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.950
 more option for foreigners is not going 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.840
 to surely get more barns and me 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.850
 I think also the amount of people 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.040
 that began to approach the forces 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.530
 basic that the base became so big 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.780
 that in this case it was diluted a little 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.170
 that was the amount of people that went from 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.240
 pumitas there is always talk about 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.880
 two aspects the hiring that 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.740
 they come from outside and the basic work 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.190
 I believe it is sustenance 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.950
 but you must have the basic work of 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.710
 the institution beyond which one comes 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.260
 two three four or five outsiders the goal 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.310
 of our directive and of sergio and a 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.990
 server is to be able to reach that team 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.320
 that's good for me personally 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.610
 marked a lot not the 90-91 where 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.280
 we were better in all he was champion and 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.170
 there were only two players East 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.110
 facts outside the quarry not that they were 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.410
 tuca and juan carlos truth the talent 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.880
 it exists but it has few opportunities 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.490
 daniel ramírez was champion scorer in 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.500
 the U-20 tournament despite the crisis 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.600
 scout of the first team see the 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.970
 games from the bench 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.910
 difficult for the position also because 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.590
 Well there are several strikers right now but 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.720
 as well the competition 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.980
 Interior competition is good 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.990
 the cougars remember their years 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.380
 wonderful those who have given them 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.360
 eleven individual goal championships 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.150
 they long for their past but now they can only 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.600
 worry about his present that he does not 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.600
 has a goal
