00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
this episode is so okay it's average I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.920 
this episode is so okay it's average I
didn't<00:00:43.890> find<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.219> funny<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> plot

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
didn't find it funny at all and the plot

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.260 
didn't find it funny at all and the plot
was<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.920> bad<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> mean<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.149> I'd

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
was not bad I mean this is what I'd

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
was not bad I mean this is what I'd
expect<00:00:48.809> from<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.079> Rugrats<00:00:49.530> Halloween<00:00:49.980> episode

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
expect from a Rugrats Halloween episode

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.880 
expect from a Rugrats Halloween episode
but<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> wasn't<00:00:51.210> incredibly<00:00:51.719> engaging<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
but it wasn't incredibly engaging and I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
but it wasn't incredibly engaging and I
find<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> tends<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> case<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.360> some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
find this tends to be the case with some

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.560 
find this tends to be the case with some
Rugrats<00:00:55.289> episodes<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.460> adult<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.090> just

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Rugrats episodes as an adult I just

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.020 
Rugrats episodes as an adult I just
can't<00:00:57.870> enjoy<00:00:58.379> them<00:00:58.649> maybe<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.820> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
can't enjoy them maybe it's because I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
can't enjoy them maybe it's because I
know<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.600> silly<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> babies<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.770> for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
know how silly the babies are for

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
know how silly the babies are for
believing<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.609> believe<00:01:02.840> whereas<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
believing what they believe whereas as a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
believing what they believe whereas as a
kid<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> might<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:04.830> fall<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

kid I might actually fall for some of
the<00:01:05.790> stuff<00:01:05.970> Angelica<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.689> say<00:01:06.930> maybe<00:01:07.320> it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the stuff Angelica would say maybe it's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.080 
the stuff Angelica would say maybe it's
because<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> big<00:01:08.369> fan<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> potty

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
because I'm not a big fan of the potty

because I'm not a big fan of the potty

humor

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
humor
maybe<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> annoying<00:01:10.590> sound<00:01:10.890> effects

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
maybe it's the annoying sound effects

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
maybe it's the annoying sound effects
which<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.700> definitely<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.780> off-putting

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
which are definitely not as off-putting

episodes<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> Rugrats<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.890> just

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
episodes of Rugrats that are just

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
episodes of Rugrats that are just
completely<00:01:32.520> ruined<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.240> me<00:01:33.329> forever<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
completely ruined for me forever and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
completely ruined for me forever and
again<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.250> this

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
again that's not to say I think this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
again that's not to say I think this
episode<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.970> bad<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.869> better<00:01:37.170> than

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
episode is bad I think it's better than

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
episode is bad I think it's better than
the<00:01:37.560> first<00:01:37.590> Halloween<00:01:38.250> special<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the first Halloween special but it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.260 
the first Halloween special but it's
nothing<00:01:39.990> special<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.189> nothing<00:01:41.610> interesting

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
nothing special it's nothing interesting

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.690 
nothing special it's nothing interesting
and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.780> hardly<00:01:43.500> even<00:01:43.799> remember<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.549> happened

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and I hardly even remember what happened

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.600 
and I hardly even remember what happened
in<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.960> saw<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.369> like

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in it and I just saw it it's a lot like

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.639 
in it and I just saw it it's a lot like
the<00:01:47.820> second<00:01:48.240> Christmas<00:01:48.750> special<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.500> also

possible that I have trouble getting

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
possible that I have trouble getting
into<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> later

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
into it because this is one of the later

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.130 
into it because this is one of the later
seasons<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> show<00:01:53.549> which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.140> notorious

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
for having gone at least a little bit

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
for having gone at least a little bit
downhill<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> shame<00:01:58.890> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
borderline of creepy so it would be

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.650 
borderline of creepy so it would be
scary<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> younger<00:02:32.370> demographic<00:02:32.490> case<00:02:33.480> in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
I could see that possibly getting a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.310 
I could see that possibly getting a
little<00:02:53.700> bit<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.000> scare<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.600> them<00:02:54.780> oh<00:02:54.959> and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
pretends that the first Halloween

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.020 
pretends that the first Halloween
episode<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.739> didn't<00:02:59.100> happen<00:02:59.280> which<00:02:59.850> I'm

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
episode just didn't happen which I'm

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.850 
episode just didn't happen which I'm
totally<00:03:00.270> okay<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.110> mean<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.590> almost

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
totally okay with I mean this almost

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.740 
totally okay with I mean this almost
feels<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.400> remake<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.480> dumb

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
feels like a remake of that but dumb

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.020 
feels like a remake of that but dumb
right<00:03:04.130> especially<00:03:05.130> considering<00:03:05.700> there's<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
right especially considering there's a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.449 
right especially considering there's a
point<00:03:06.360> where<00:03:06.660> Angelica<00:03:07.260> gets<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:08.040> scared

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
point where Angelica gets really scared

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.729 
point where Angelica gets really scared
and<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> babies<00:03:09.300> are<00:03:09.330> not<00:03:09.840> speaking<00:03:10.650> of

and the babies are not speaking of

and the babies are not speaking of
Angelica<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.550> do<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.270> fact<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.630> in<00:03:12.780> this

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
Angelica I do like the fact that in this

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.080 
Angelica I do like the fact that in this
episode<00:03:13.380> she<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.800> punished<00:03:14.340> quite<00:03:14.790> thoroughly

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
episode she is punished quite thoroughly

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.600
