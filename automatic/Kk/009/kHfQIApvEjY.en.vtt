00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Today, we'll look behind the scenes of our

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
last movie project "Hans-Werner is expandig"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:27.000
(original sound track)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
First, we have to glue all banners and signs for the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
extensive range of products onto the ice cream cart.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's almost no space left!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Look! How am I supposed to put a sign here?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The nice thing about crazy glue: it bonds like crazy...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
...but only the fingers!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The smaller the material in front of the camera,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the more it strains our nerves behind the camera!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(original sound track)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Also, while dubbing the sequences, the impersonators for the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
voices of the figurines had some issues.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(original sound track)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
...after 1000 perceived retakes, the finished product looks like this!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(original sound track)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
One of our biggest challenges was that the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
ice cream cart has wheels, but they cannot actually turn.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
How am I supposed to move the figurine in a flowing motion?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Therefore, we have this wire which moves the bicycle.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Then this turning figurine...

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's terrible, when we have to drill holes into a perfect layout!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I hope, noone of the model makers watches this...they'll punch me out!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Even worse, when a drill breaks!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Which DIDN'T HAPPEN AT ALL drilling the second hole...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We can now turn the figurine with a wand from underneath the layout.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The movie set grows from scene to scene!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Here, one of the scenes with original dubbing,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
where the director slips deeply into his character.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:44.000
(original sound track)

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And the finished product!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(original sound track)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Here, the key sequence.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Back at the harbor where already in the first spot, Hans Werner

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
successfully drove the director nuts.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
That's not so bad! One retake!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And from different perspectives!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Yep, turn a little bit...oh no, back, turn...and stop!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Turn a little more...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Stop!

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
...now, turn a little further...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
yes...stop!...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
...turn...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Stop!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
...turn...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Stop!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
...turn back...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
...a bit in the other direction...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Stop!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Nevermind, we have enough material we can use!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Finally, an alternative end

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
with a famous model maker.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Whoever knows him will understand!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:00.000
