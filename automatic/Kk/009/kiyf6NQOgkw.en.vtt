00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 good to all the teammates today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.560
 I want to talk a little bit about what 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.059
 difference between small samples and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.460
 great because there are many people who do not even know 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.920
 hey it's better to use small samples 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.570
 medium or large this taking into 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.120
 mind that we are talking about definÃ­ 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.480
 normal not in order and light 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.050
 and 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.760
 that we would consider a small sample 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.170
 a small sample 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 would be for example was a vid 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.079
 22 centimeters 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.710
 and this is a rare sample that I do not remember 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.300
 which is 8 centimeters that is 35 grams 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.629
 this what we would consider a sample 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.629
 little 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.290
 what kind of fish can we catch with 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.510
 these good generally the rest that 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.790
 a factory will be removing status 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.660
 some species that are thrown a lot to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.520
 the schools 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.020
 are like for example the pretty ones 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.210
 atlantic the barracudas in a time 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.190
 among other types of species but 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 usually with this type of sample what 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.140
 that we are going to get fishing felipe or 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.600
 medium fish large fish is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.050
 extremely rare to take samples of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.230
 this size but it can happen 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.230
 then we would have a median 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.950
 for example here a mesh 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 the medium sample that is what 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.980
 we would consider as such a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.290
 sample between 12 and 15 centimeters is what 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.420
 that would be a sample through with this 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.060
 shows what we're going to get are 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 fish some small species but 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.980
 usually fish usually from 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.880
 average size that we would consider as 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.300
 average size with good kilos and 34 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.330
 with style 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.730
 you can not also throw pieces of 56 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 9 kilos 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.090
 but what is weirder is not uncommon 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.440
 but still we would have more 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 odds with a sample of this 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.370
 size than with a small sample like 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.770
 the tension 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.260
 and then we would have what they would be 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.650
 already large samples here we would have a 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.920
 farm 17 centimeters with 5 almost 18 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 centimeters 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 a sample that big 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.350
 a pretty big sample and here 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.200
 we would have a 16-centimeter machine 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.380
 and it's also a fat sample 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.170
 pretty broad sample 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.970
 generally the fish that we are going to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.550
 get with this this big state 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.540
 as a general rule and in some 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.510
 cases that been medium 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.920
 because a fish is more rare 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.109
 small and you throw this kind of 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.880
 samples there are always exceptions the 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.190
 sea â€‹â€‹bass and other species that 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.140
 they catch well and maybe a sea bass from 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.740
 half a kilo swallows half of selling 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.030
 decoy no 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.050
 but well this would be the reference with 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.750
 that kind of expression 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.900
 example is that I the last catch that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.120
 I took with the piece of this weight 8 kilos 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.540
 and the last one I caught with one of these 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.310
 Weighed 4 kilos Dialogue and the penultimate 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.319
 to about 8 kilos 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.590
 then for example the subject changes a lot 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.270
 of the times for example in winter the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.670
 fish is usually thrown 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.560
 much more to long samples and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.480
 big 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.940
 like this 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.620
 the small samples and especially in 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.409
 spring that is when the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.330
 schools of sardines or moros morones 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.420
 etc. the fish is usually thrown away 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.220
 much more to samples 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.410
 and well a little more if someone has a 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.730
 no doubt you can write me down a greeting 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.030
 partner 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.030
 ah
