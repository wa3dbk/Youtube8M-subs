 [Music] 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.400
 hello how are you welcome to the 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.379
 curly channel where click to this video on 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.570
 today we are going to learn to do 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.390
 the test to see if a metal works 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.670
 of a mother refrigerator no frost is very 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.429
 simple what we have to do is 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.579
 remove the panel where the 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.669
 fan since we remove it we're going to 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.980
 remove the metal that comes in this in 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.770
 we connect this tube in series with a 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.770
 multimeter to see here you see multimeter 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.610
 of pure state 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.740
 we connect it in series with a multimeter 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.740
 on a plate we put water with ice 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.949
 here is the water with the ice and here 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.700
 we have the metal the pimental what 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.420
 disconnect 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 he lives such is usually placed in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:07.640
 this area so you take it off you put it on 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.640
 series with your multimeter 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.600
 and you have to give continuity but this 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.620
 detects when she not only right now 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.850
 is connected but does not give us 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.580
 continuity what we are going to do is that 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.570
 we put in series with the multimeter 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.140
 the mind joy to the water there with hielitos and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.940
 we hope that if it is activated and already 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.410
 that was activated because obviously it's going to 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.150
 mark the continuity that we are 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.280
 waiting 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.640
 [Music] 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.980
 so it is proven 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.940
 [Music] 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.940
 metallic vi of a refrigerator no frost 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 who has a little bit of time down is not there 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.360
 marking continuity 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.650
 let's give it another little while 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.440
 [Music] 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.380
 while I'm telling you here this 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.710
 is what the deposit of 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 gas here is the resistance 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 the resistance is this that is here 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.360
 down is here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.240
 [Music] 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.960
 in the refridgerator 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.730
 and you have a little bit 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.460
 I saw it metallic and it does not know 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.360
 [Music] 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.640
 marked the continuity that we hope that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.620
 have good here here we are going to say 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.690
 to the experiment we're going to throw this 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.300
 water let's put more ice and we're going 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.510
 to put salt to lower even more the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.850
 water temperature and thus propitiate is 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.800
 precisely the function of the metallic 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.470
 to see what happens because it already leads as 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.970
 10 minutes and it has not closed follows 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.300
 open 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.670
 so if he's still open 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.010
 the system will think that all the ice 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.990
 the tank all think there's no ice and 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.200
 the refrigerator is not going to be turned off to 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.780
 make yourself of heaven though the clock 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.260
 I went through the thawing function because 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.110
 will be revealed because it says in the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.480
 card tells the driver not to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 has ice and can continue to work 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.260
 let's do that use to remove that 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.569
 ice put more water with salt for 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.930
 lower the temperature about 45 degrees more 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.910
 to see if that way you can activate the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.010
 paprika, which is still open 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.170
 that's why sometimes it's full of ice 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.930
 the coil and freeze up but down 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.930
 the cold does not pass and what causes 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.560
 they are few that causes that 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.659
 the refrigerator take longer 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.519
 turn off and do not turn off due to temperatures 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.920
 and do not pay for the finished one that has 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.430
 down on the engine and when I was 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.159
 running the clock does not thaw and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.560
 it is covered up and it is not 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.780
 cooling down and in what is translated 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.640
 so that your receipt of the light is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.319
 reaching higher because of the 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.709
 refrigerator that is not working in 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.510
 ideal conditions or that you get 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.190
 but it's the food below that does not cool 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.200
 down for example milk 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.930
 in things more sensitive to heat the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.270
 metallic is a suiche temperature when 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.610
 reaches a temperature is going to close and 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.350
 will give us the continuity that 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.420
 we seek and vision continuity is going to 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.090
 move to the resistance so that it unloads 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.970
 the defrosting if you notice that here 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.780
 The continuity is marking us 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.170
 cables are not not getting together is 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.390
 the metal that either already acts now 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.040
 let's see if we can warm up so that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.550
 return as possible as I was 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.400
 here we have already the warm water we are going to 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.710
 put it on the lid 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.470
 [Music] 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.470
 and there it went out 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.540
 and went off feed let's put the 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.540
 cold water again 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.400
 we waited a little while in fact this 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.320
 you hear a click when it is activated and you 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.590
 off you hear a click is a 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.750
 metallic thermostat that has inside 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.750
 [Applause] 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:41.080
 do not despair because this takes a 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:44.340
 little bit of metal to cool 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.340
 so then 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.419
 and then as in the warm lap it takes 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.249
 more in cooling down and that I do not have a 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.529
 thermometer to show you have to 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:01.559
 show them at what temperature it is 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.509
 closing but it's roughly up 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:07.499
 the 8 degrees below zero is when 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:09.240
 you start doing by reflection that you 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:12.710
 closes the circuit closes and the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.900
 current to the resistance and tells the 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.120
 processor that there is ice and that has to 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.159
 start the thaw cycle according to the 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.249
 time the timer is on 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:27.369
 timer or watch as you know him 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:29.049
 here we have it still immersed in the 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:32.529
 water with ice have passed 

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:34.440
 it's about a minute and a half from 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:38.250
 that we put it 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.810
 and aita has not yet closed and so 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.760
 Hill 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.169
 continuity is not being marked 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.169
 we can warm water 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.870
 there it is since it will pay 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.780
 then we already know that the beat metal 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.950
 it's okay 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:02.100
 and this is a piece like this goes there 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.950
 This is how well as fixed 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.990
 practically stuck to the tube and that's how it is 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.230
 how a beat metal is checked in a 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.360
 fridge 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.700
 Well, see you until a following 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.110
 video remember to subscribe to the channel in 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.570
 the button that is up here in the

 milk screen and is part of this

 robert network community that grows day 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.760
 by day we are seeing up 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.760
 following
