00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.540
 girls hello welcome to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 my channel quite a lot of products have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.340
 I have accumulated so I decided to write 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.220
 the second part if you are interested in the format 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.810
 then keep watching this video 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 girls remember I told you about 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.640
 shol roller file 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.519
 This is a file for a dry pedicure 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 so here they released three new nozzles 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.480
 with a crumb diamond of course the most 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.329
 girls best friends are diamonds 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 film is the hardest material 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.110
 known for their abrasive properties 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.350
 as you know it is applied in various 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.850
 cosmetic procedures 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.149
 professional tools and so on 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.629
 so 3 nozzles first video 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.910
 extra hard made in blue 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.399
 second medium hard roller is made 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.250
 in blue and extra soft roller for 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.350
 polishing he completes the procedure personally 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.729
 I am suitable for medium hardness 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.640
 because I don't have any special 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.380
 problems but sometimes for heels especially 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.409
 Now in the summer when it is especially 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.119
 relevant and we wear different sneakers 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.640
 we may have some more 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.490
 hardened calluses i use extra 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 hard but very rarely if you have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.360
 right serious calluses then he will help you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.640
 and of course I complete all this 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.790
 polishing procedure to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.460
 heels were absolutely soft smooth 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.259
 if we talk about the price then the nozzle is worth 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.110
 as much as the previous version 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.030
 there are two in one box in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.310
 One set seems to me that such 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.170
 there is enough for a box for a year 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.229
 save your family budget 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.360
 so I would recommend the advice of the company 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.930
 feedback sent me a long time ago 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.100
 a palette of shadows and I could not somehow with 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 make friends with her and understand she likes me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 or do not like what I can say in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.649
 the result is matte shades chic 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.830
 beautiful really saturated and excellent 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.150
 pass the pigment go very nicely 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.220
 well stew ie claims 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.819
 i have zero and it is really cool 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.769
 shades as for satin shades 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.840
 then I would not say that they are delighted 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:29.500
 and knowing the price of this palette on the site I would 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.909
 I not handed over the shade so much money but 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.890
 there are two 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.349
 satin shade which is really 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.849
 stunning looks very cool it 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.409
 this shade 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:45.190
 I'll write in the screenshot yes pink and here 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.409
 here here is brown with gold 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.720
 interspersed with this brown 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.269
 golden splashes looks great 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.639
 when you make smokey ice just 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.480
 amazing curry eyes 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:01.450
 And it looks well , somehow on the evening 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.519
 and very festive as for here 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.889
 this pink shade then he just 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.870
 this color is interesting in itself 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.480
 perceived by each person 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.939
 differently then there is this color chameleon and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.489
 everyone will see him a little differently on 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.569
 each skin it looks differently 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:22.239
 so what I'll show you now how 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.879
 swatch possible before our eyes it will be 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.220
 look different but the most 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.379
 paletka if brothers in general and me 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.720
 I like it, I can say that I am 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.329
 delighted but I liked the company 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.840
 ericsson sent me a lot of their 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.790
 means and it would be ball leaves 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.760
 antiperspirant and honestly for 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.799
 daily use i am not 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.650
 I prefer rexona explain why 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.440
 they have a pretty bright to me this perfume 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.229
 does not fit but during sports with me 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.959
 always in a sports bag lies exactly 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.879
 their antiperspirant especially new 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.669
 which you didn't release machines and 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.699
 It was at the presentation at rexona 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:06.099
 and they talked about how to act 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.599
 their antiperspirant their novelty action 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.989
 is that when you 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.239
 move activated microcapsules 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.849
 freshness of fish saying the more you 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.099
 move the better you smell so here 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.930
 it is during sport that it is really 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.280
 effective really relevant 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.550
 because not 1 suite yet 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.900
 you brand did not replace ericsson and that is 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.150
 for Sport 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.570
 and the last one for today is such 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.580
 awesome hair ruler you don't 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.630
 imagine how it smells she smells 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.000
 peaches 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.950
 and you know, three days go by like 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.290
 you washed your head it is time to be 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.210
 again and you still smell peaches 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.940
 even my husband praised that the fuse is burning 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.010
 how amazing hair smells and by the way 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.760
 now he can also wash himself 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.220
 about shampoo 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.030
 he does not wash his hair well after him 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.660
 stand on end personally washes away the dirt from 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.930
 hair 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.930
 but I go after this shampoo for two days 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.850
 3 they normally do not know why can 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.980
 to be this thing is not a masked shampoo 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.900
 I will try to experiment 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.840
 use this shampoo separately from 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.330
 masks what can I say about air conditioning 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.770
 he really nourishes his hair but 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.410
 very bad moisturizes 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.510
 since my hair is dry is more important to me 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.639
 hydration rather than nutrition because 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.070
 feeding my hair seems to be like 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.770
 doesn't know enough maybe this 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.229
 air conditioning will suit me in the winter 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.500
 because then they lack not 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.660
 nutrition and hydration is nothing now in summer 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.880
 for me it's a bust that I can say 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.400
 about the mask, it is really effective 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.610
 she is straight thermonuclear she is good 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.360
 moisturizes hair just like after 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.460
 salon 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.410
 but I do not think that such masks are needed 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.100
 use is often better to use 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.229
 such masochki every other week but me 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.650
 it seemed that she still weights 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.080
 hair after she needs to wash her hair more often 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.970
 maybe i'm wrong by the way write who 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.060
 used these funds because 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.580
 I honestly before they sent me 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.190
 I did not see them on the market. 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.200
 bloggers or anywhere else these were all 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.450
 the means I wanted to show you 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.580
 I hope this video was for you 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.900
 helpful and informative and I'm with you 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.900
 goodbye to all for now
