00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
mix on the first film I think he could

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
mix on the first film I think he could
sense<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.810> point<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.770> could<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
sense at that point that it could it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
sense at that point that it could it
could<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> hit<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.540> anticipation<00:01:39.869> of

could be a hit and in anticipation of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
could be a hit and in anticipation of
that<00:01:40.439> he<00:01:41.189> said<00:01:41.400> I'd<00:01:41.490> love<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> start

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.729 
process so from the first film what I
liked<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.220> most<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.540> dance<00:02:57.989> seek<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.590> call

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
liked the most is the dance seek I call

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.750 
liked the most is the dance seek I call
it<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.829> dance<00:02:59.069> sequence<00:02:59.519> when<00:02:59.640> you're

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
it the dance sequence when you're

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.729 
it the dance sequence when you're
drawing<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.180> sand<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.720> where<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.530> come

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
drawing in the sand and where they come

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.380 
drawing in the sand and where they come
together<00:03:01.890> would<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.489> make<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.760> connection<00:03:03.150> for

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
together would it make a connection for

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.870 
together would it make a connection for
the<00:03:03.480> first<00:03:03.660> time<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.220> exquisite<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.459> mean<00:03:05.670> it

the first time it is exquisite I mean it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.630 
the first time it is exquisite I mean it
literally<00:03:06.690> turns<00:03:06.989> into<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.260> dance<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.980> I've

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.069 
literally turns into a dance and I've
never<00:03:08.819> seen<00:03:08.970> anything<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.690> what<00:03:09.930> was

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
never seen anything like it so what was

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.460 
never seen anything like it so what was
it<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.739> developing<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.420> well<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:13.349> know

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it like developing that well you know

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.960 
it like developing that well you know
for<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> longest<00:03:13.799> time<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.340> our<00:03:14.430> writers<00:03:14.730> room

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
for the longest time in our writers room

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.850 
for the longest time in our writers room
that<00:03:15.329> sequence<00:03:15.930> was<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.380> called<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> black

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
that sequence was just called the black

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.910 
that sequence was just called the black
stallion<00:03:17.069> moment<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.109> way<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.769> got

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
stallion moment so in a way it's got

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.430 
stallion moment so in a way it's got
this<00:03:20.040> really<00:03:20.250> derivative<00:03:21.150> essence<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.290> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
this really derivative essence to it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.580 
this really derivative essence to it
which<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:24.019> necessary<00:03:25.019> scene<00:03:25.319> where

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
which is the the necessary scene where

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.340 
which is the the necessary scene where
the<00:03:26.250> innocence<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.540> human<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.319> the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
the innocence of the human and the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.270 
the innocence of the human and the
creature<00:03:28.620> we're<00:03:28.859> going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> come<00:03:29.160> together

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
creature we're going to come together

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.599 
creature we're going to come together
and<00:03:29.870> form<00:03:30.870> their<00:03:31.109> first<00:03:31.290> bond<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.889> we<00:03:32.400> called

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
and form their first bond and we called

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.129 
and form their first bond and we called
it<00:03:32.730> forbidden<00:03:33.030> friendship<00:03:33.389> but<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.079> the

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
it forbidden friendship but for the

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.240 
it forbidden friendship but for the
longest<00:03:34.350> time<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.620> didn't<00:03:34.859> touch<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.160> because

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
longest time we didn't touch it because

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.400 
longest time we didn't touch it because
we<00:03:35.549> knew<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:36.389> wanted<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:37.049> largely

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
we knew that we wanted it to be largely

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
we knew that we wanted it to be largely
wordless<00:03:38.310> driven<00:03:39.269> by<00:03:39.389> music<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.190> poetic<00:03:41.190> but

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
wordless driven by music and poetic but

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.099 
wordless driven by music and poetic but
we<00:03:42.090> were<00:03:42.180> too<00:03:42.299> busy<00:03:42.329> dealing<00:03:42.660> with<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
we were too busy dealing with the

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.780 
we were too busy dealing with the
logistics<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.709> how<00:03:43.769> everything<00:03:44.220> was<00:03:44.340> going<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
logistics of how everything was going to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.900 
logistics of how everything was going to
fall<00:03:45.269> into<00:03:45.420> place<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.069> kind<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.730> let<00:03:47.880> it

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
fall into place that we kind of let it

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.050 
fall into place that we kind of let it
sit<00:03:48.209> for<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.420> while<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.810> then<00:03:49.319> one<00:03:49.530> day<00:03:50.060> while

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
sit for a while and then one day while

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.030 
sit for a while and then one day while
we<00:03:51.239> were<00:03:51.359> kind<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.600> spending<00:03:52.440> time<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.650> two

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
we were kind of spending time in two

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.390 
we were kind of spending time in two
different<00:03:53.280> edit<00:03:53.609> Suites<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:55.099> was<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.280> was

the scene and it was one of those scenes
that<00:04:06.000> just<00:04:06.180> sort<00:04:06.329> of<00:04:06.420> evolved<00:04:06.959> really<00:04:07.290> nicely

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that just sort of evolved really nicely

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.289 
that just sort of evolved really nicely
and<00:04:07.859> there's<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.340> documentary<00:04:08.519> actually<00:04:09.180> that

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
and there's a documentary actually that

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.259 
and there's a documentary actually that

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
we put together just camcorder footage

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.460 
we put together just camcorder footage
called<00:04:12.269> finding<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.690> story<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.200> can<00:04:13.319> see

called finding the story and you can see

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.809 
called finding the story and you can see
that<00:04:13.500> moment<00:04:13.950> actually<00:04:14.069> evolving<00:04:14.579> on<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
that moment actually evolving on the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.279 
that moment actually evolving on the
spot<00:04:15.030> but<00:04:15.840> they<00:04:15.930> were<00:04:15.989> sitting<00:04:16.260> there

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
spot but they were sitting there

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.440 
spot but they were sitting there
sketching<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:16.979> talking<00:04:17.310> about<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:18.209> know<00:04:18.299> how

sketching and talking about you know how
the<00:04:18.810> whole<00:04:18.959> concept<00:04:19.200> was<00:04:19.530> how<00:04:19.709> does<00:04:20.190> hiccup

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
the whole concept was how does hiccup

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.620 
the whole concept was how does hiccup
take<00:04:21.630> something<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.229> he<00:04:22.409> is<00:04:23.060> an<00:04:24.060> oddity<00:04:24.599> for

out here in this Cove you know with this

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.879 
out here in this Cove you know with this
creature<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.780> becomes<00:04:37.050> their<00:04:37.410> the

left him alone but he's on the other

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.370 
left him alone but he's on the other
side<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.389> code<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.810> sketching<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.290> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
side of the code to sketching in the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.050 
side of the code to sketching in the
sand<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.800> maybe<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.160> then<00:04:53.430> draws<00:04:53.729> out<00:04:54.030> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
sand that maybe that then draws out the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.120 
sand that maybe that then draws out the
curiosity<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> dragon<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.320> we<00:04:55.440> start<00:04:56.040> to

curiosity of the dragon and we start to

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.620 
curiosity of the dragon and we start to
see<00:04:56.190> this<00:04:56.430> other<00:04:56.610> side<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:57.000> him<00:04:57.270> where<00:04:57.419> he<00:04:57.540> went

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
see this other side of him where he went

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.300 
see this other side of him where he went

of left it alone we just said you know
the<00:05:10.050> beginning<00:05:10.380> in<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.500> end<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:10.949> is<00:05:11.100> yeah

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
the beginning in the end of it is yeah

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.060 
the beginning in the end of it is yeah
that<00:05:11.760> hiccup<00:05:12.090> arrives<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.990> feed<00:05:13.169> him<00:05:13.289> yeah<00:05:13.889> and

you<00:05:18.690> know<00:05:19.280> hiccup<00:05:20.280> wears<00:05:20.490> him<00:05:20.610> down<00:05:20.639> to<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
you know hiccup wears him down to the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.879 
you know hiccup wears him down to the
point<00:05:21.300> where<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.810> Dragons<00:05:22.139> curious<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.830> I

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
point where the Dragons curious and I

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.219 
point where the Dragons curious and I
start<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.250> see<00:05:23.430> certain<00:05:24.300> dragon<00:05:24.750> behaviors

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
start to see certain dragon behaviors

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.719 
start to see certain dragon behaviors
that<00:05:25.410> were<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.770> are<00:05:25.889> surprising<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.490> hiccup

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
that were that are surprising to hiccup

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.939 
that were that are surprising to hiccup
as<00:05:26.880> well<00:05:27.060> right<00:05:27.389> so<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.139> idea<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.440> he<00:05:28.860> would

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
as well right so the idea that he would

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.379 
as well right so the idea that he would
have<00:05:29.100> an<00:05:29.190> opinion<00:05:29.460> about<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.970> drawing<00:05:30.240> that

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
have an opinion about the drawing that

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.909 
have an opinion about the drawing that
he<00:05:30.510> made<00:05:30.690> in<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.870> sand<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.410> that<00:05:31.440> hiccup

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
he made in the sand and that hiccup

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.770 
he made in the sand and that hiccup
can't<00:05:32.160> step<00:05:32.550> on<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.760> lines<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.450> that<00:05:33.570> leads

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
can't step on the lines and that leads

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.510 
can't step on the lines and that leads
them<00:05:33.900> together<00:05:34.289> that<00:05:35.039> was<00:05:35.160> just<00:05:35.370> something

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
them together that was just something

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.600 
them together that was just something
that<00:05:35.639> sort<00:05:35.820> of<00:05:35.940> evolved<00:05:36.510> with<00:05:37.349> with<00:05:38.099> tron<00:05:38.400> may

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
that sort of evolved with with tron may

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.820 
that sort of evolved with with tron may

carloni who was our head of story and
chris<00:05:42.840> sanders<00:05:43.139> kind<00:05:43.349> of<00:05:43.410> all<00:05:43.940> mixing<00:05:44.940> around

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
chris sanders kind of all mixing around

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.740 
chris sanders kind of all mixing around
those<00:05:45.599> ideas<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:46.349> how<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.710> how<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.099> whole

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
those ideas of how that how that whole

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.600 
those ideas of how that how that whole
choreography<00:05:48.750> would<00:05:48.900> work<00:05:49.050> ok<00:05:49.740> ok<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.340> then

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
choreography would work ok ok so then

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.339 
choreography would work ok ok so then
can<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.300> ask<00:05:51.479> more<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.780> little<00:05:52.020> more<00:05:52.080> about

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
can I ask more a little more about

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.219 
can I ask more a little more about
Dragon<00:05:52.530> 3<00:05:52.919> your<00:05:53.849> love<00:05:53.970> sure<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:55.139> know

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
Dragon 3 your love sure and you know

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.310 
Dragon 3 your love sure and you know
right<00:05:55.440> now<00:05:55.590> it's<00:05:55.830> sort<00:05:56.130> of<00:05:56.539> it's<00:05:57.539> a<00:05:57.900> lot<00:05:58.139> of<00:05:58.260> the

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
right now it's sort of it's a lot of the

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.620 
right now it's sort of it's a lot of the
elements<00:05:58.440> are<00:05:58.740> up<00:05:58.860> in<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.070> air<00:05:59.099> because<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.820> had

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
elements are up in the air because I had

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.650 
elements are up in the air because I had
a<00:06:00.660> working<00:06:00.990> outline<00:06:01.500> for<00:06:02.270> like<00:06:03.270> a<00:06:03.360> year<00:06:03.389> and<00:06:03.570> a

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
a working outline for like a year and a

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.589 
a working outline for like a year and a
half<00:06:03.720> or<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.310> leading<00:06:05.310> up<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.639> this<00:06:05.760> point<00:06:06.030> but

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
half or so leading up to this point but

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.219 
half or so leading up to this point but
I<00:06:06.660> had<00:06:06.960> been<00:06:07.110> borrowing<00:06:07.590> elements<00:06:08.099> from<00:06:08.520> it<00:06:09.229> to

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
I had been borrowing elements from it to

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.550 
I had been borrowing elements from it to
to<00:06:10.770> use<00:06:10.979> in<00:06:11.250> Dragon<00:06:11.639> 2<00:06:11.849> so<00:06:12.660> I<00:06:12.690> have<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.380> kind<00:06:13.470> of

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
to use in Dragon 2 so I have to kind of

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.110 
to use in Dragon 2 so I have to kind of
take<00:06:13.680> a<00:06:13.740> fresh<00:06:13.949> look<00:06:13.979> at<00:06:14.340> it<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.639> think<00:06:14.970> the

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
take a fresh look at it I think the

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.510 
take a fresh look at it I think the
larger<00:06:15.570> pieces<00:06:15.750> are<00:06:16.020> still<00:06:16.260> the<00:06:16.349> same<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:16.800> it

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
larger pieces are still the same and it

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.580 
larger pieces are still the same and it
still<00:06:17.789> will<00:06:17.910> end<00:06:18.180> with<00:06:18.449> the<00:06:18.570> same<00:06:18.780> aspiration

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
still will end with the same aspiration

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.300 
still will end with the same aspiration
that<00:06:20.660> that<00:06:21.660> Cressida<00:06:22.260> has<00:06:22.440> for<00:06:22.710> her<00:06:22.830> last<00:06:23.070> book

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
that that Cressida has for her last book

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.520
