oh<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.330> it's<00:04:48.660> pretty<00:04:48.810> much<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.050> layer<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.620> here

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
oh so it's pretty much the layer of here

oh so it's pretty much the layer of here
progressively<00:04:51.150> over<00:04:51.449> so<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.750> should<00:04:51.990> be

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
progressively over so that should be

getting to the pot black bottom where
you're<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.910> know<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.240> when<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:54.780> start<00:04:55.050> with

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
you're you know and when you start with

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.020 
you're you know and when you start with
the<00:04:55.260> farm<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.770> said<00:04:55.979> just<00:04:56.160> 45s<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:56.789> it's

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
the farm like you said just 45s and it's

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.550 
the farm like you said just 45s and it's
especially<00:04:57.419> for<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> beginner<00:04:58.050> it's<00:04:58.410> gonna

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
especially for a beginner it's gonna

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.680 
especially for a beginner it's gonna
take<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.800> long<00:04:58.979> time<00:04:59.280> before<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.669> peek<00:05:00.180> at<00:05:00.419> your

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
take a long time before you peek at your

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.620 
take a long time before you peek at your
your<00:05:01.590> Mac<00:05:01.770> splints<00:05:02.220> grab<00:05:02.639> a<00:05:02.669> still<00:05:02.970> how<00:05:03.570> we

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
your Mac splints grab a still how we

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.000 
your Mac splints grab a still how we
really<00:05:03.930> worried<00:05:04.169> about<00:05:04.229> that<00:05:04.560> when<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.860> do

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
really worried about that when you do

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.580 
really worried about that when you do
into<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:05.430> what<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.210> can<00:05:06.419> back<00:05:07.199> down<00:05:07.410> the

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
into that what you can back down the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.620 
into that what you can back down the
weights<00:05:07.800> maybe<00:05:08.010> thirty<00:05:08.310> percent<00:05:08.639> or<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:08.850> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
weights maybe thirty percent or so and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.070 
weights maybe thirty percent or so and
then<00:05:09.720> just<00:05:10.050> keep<00:05:10.200> on<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.770> same<00:05:10.979> strategy

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
then just keep on that same strategy

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.350 
then just keep on that same strategy
step<00:05:12.319> back<00:05:12.470> two<00:05:12.650> steps<00:05:12.710> for<00:05:13.189> or<00:05:13.639> you<00:05:13.939> good<00:05:14.180> if

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
step back two steps for or you good if

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.820 
step back two steps for or you good if
you<00:05:14.479> really<00:05:14.750> hit<00:05:14.930> your<00:05:15.139> potential<00:05:15.680> on<00:05:15.740> the

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
you really hit your potential on the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.960 
you really hit your potential on the
linear<00:05:16.099> progression<00:05:16.250> can<00:05:16.729> go<00:05:16.819> into

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
linear progression can go into

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.270 
linear progression can go into
periodization<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:17.960> think<00:05:18.259> the<00:05:18.319> stock<00:05:18.530> which<00:05:19.129> is

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
periodization I think the stock which is
