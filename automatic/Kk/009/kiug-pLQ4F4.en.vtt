00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.850
 your phone is that without music 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.759
 also we are not on 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.870
 urgent to receive said normal on 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.310
 lines and here are these sneakers 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.080
 I have no special mailing list 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.760
 cross-country this kind of relevant principles 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.800
 for running, they are also suitable and small 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.750
 distance is in my opinion my lunar 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.610
 bass but after a while I will them 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.610
 By the way, they are very convenient and generally 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.979
 like pads i run so that's cool 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.510
 in general, as I said, I always take with 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.310
 my iphone because i can't 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.410
 I can without music and also I have here 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.180
 there is a folder called sports 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.310
 I have two programs here 1 pisa tags 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.110
 which already told you this 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.250
 the program is training plan for 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.930
 order to achieve some 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.090
 a certain result to the necessary 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.640
 date and general today I have scheduled 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.670
 45 minutes workout mean run 5 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.380
 rooms from 4 kilometers to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.170
 and in general it is a very convenient program. 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.630
 also there is nike + running 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.130
 I used to be very active but 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.810
 Recently, do not use as 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.209
 Now I have such watch 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 which showed already in the vlog and they 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.890
 fix their speed and and heartbeat and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.300
 time made in the way general very 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.550
 handy thing is not necessary for this 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.530
 now they are with them entirely in general 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.019
 now i'm getting ready to jog i turn on 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.570
 highlighting the clock and now it is necessary that she 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.140
 the clock caught the satellites outside it 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.690
 happens pretty quickly 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.760
 now my position will be fixed 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.160
 start running today's workout 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.270
 I'm pretty long nose pretty 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 low pace it will be necessary 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.069
 hold on and and run rather slowly 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.610
 built now I turn on the timer and 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.610
 ran 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.530
 When meeting with the Crimea, I wanted halfway 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.269
 there is only wife left 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.480
 make the weather super nice 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.520
 evening walk in the afternoon sky 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.260
 secondly the presence of drinking fountains 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.180
 the whole arch is super comfortable 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.980
 especially when flying to your not hot and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.140
 no convictions large forces with them not 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.140
 took the water so i adore 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.570
 since i'm a novice runner where necessary 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.360
 constantly 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.710
 so that I do not go too far because it 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.990
 really harmful if you have too 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.220
 high course because this escape then 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.930
 no good will be for your 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.600
 the body will only overload very 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.760
 I was now a course 181 is very bad 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.530
 this is a big excess so i 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.910
 I tried to sleep because It did not help 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.600
 so I decided to stop them 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.760
 to pierce 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.080
 if you run two hours of sonnets that 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.100
 measure the pulse is not really 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.870
 be sure to buy some expensive 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.030
 you can yourself to the racks themselves though 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.300
 but still, even if you donâ€™t have it 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.980
 the easiest way to check 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.560
 too you accelerate only on you 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.030
 This much salt there is this talk the 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.560
 there is if you can calmly normal 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.020
 conspire escape means you knit 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.330
 right if not leave like me 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.860
 already said so 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.860
 I would take a breath and I can 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.830
 how hello 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.180
 that's where we ran here now at the top or 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.180
 same 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:40.009
 Liza lacks 600 meters from the rules and 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:40.009
 run in circles around the house here it is 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.220
 approaching
