00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.180 
with that grade of execution twos and
threes<00:05:07.150> you'd<00:05:07.570> imagine<00:05:08.110> for<00:05:08.680> those<00:05:08.800> elements

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
threes you'd imagine for those elements

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.620 
threes you'd imagine for those elements
because<00:05:09.580> there<00:05:09.759> was<00:05:09.880> nothing<00:05:10.419> wrong<00:05:10.570> with

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
because there was nothing wrong with

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.360 
because there was nothing wrong with
them<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:12.900> loved<00:05:13.900> Ana's<00:05:14.349> performance<00:05:14.949> before

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
them I loved Ana's performance before

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.219 
them I loved Ana's performance before
then<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.699> just<00:05:16.090> comparing<00:05:16.570> them<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.080> mean

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
then and just comparing them I mean

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.499 
then and just comparing them I mean
Hannah<00:05:17.490> she<00:05:18.490> probably<00:05:18.699> if<00:05:18.849> you<00:05:18.940> looked<00:05:19.210> at<00:05:19.389> the

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
Hannah she probably if you looked at the

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.260 
Hannah she probably if you looked at the
step<00:05:19.810> sequences<00:05:20.409> on<00:05:20.590> their<00:05:20.830> own<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:21.400> put

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
step sequences on their own and put

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.689 
step sequences on their own and put
those<00:05:22.479> side-by-side<00:05:23.349> she<00:05:23.469> had<00:05:23.650> more<00:05:23.919> content

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
those side-by-side she had more content

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.540 
those side-by-side she had more content
in<00:05:24.909> there<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.389> the<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.289> spins<00:05:26.710> were<00:05:27.070> matching

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
in there and the the spins were matching

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.890 
in there and the the spins were matching
but

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
but

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.110 
but
as<00:05:28.290> far<00:05:28.590> as<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.160> jump<00:05:29.460> elements<00:05:30.000> are

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
as far as the the jump elements are

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.350 
as far as the the jump elements are
concerned<00:05:30.570> as<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.680> Vetter<00:05:31.919> it's<00:05:32.430> pushing<00:05:32.910> above
