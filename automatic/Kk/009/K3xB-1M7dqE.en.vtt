was<00:00:32.119> in<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.360> works<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.020> looks<00:00:33.170> like<00:00:33.320> it's

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
was in the works but it looks like it's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.230 
was in the works but it looks like it's
gonna<00:00:33.590> have<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:33.830> few<00:00:34.190> new<00:00:34.340> things<00:00:34.670> that<00:00:35.030> makes

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
gonna have a few new things that makes

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.720 
gonna have a few new things that makes
it<00:00:35.420> different<00:00:35.720> from<00:00:36.079> those<00:00:36.560> services<00:00:37.250> that

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
it different from those services that

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.600 
it different from those services that
were<00:00:37.910> in<00:00:38.090> Prior<00:00:38.480> battlefield<00:00:39.230> games<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
were in Prior battlefield games so the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.700 
were in Prior battlefield games so the
one<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:40.970> I<00:00:41.000> found<00:00:41.270> most<00:00:41.450> interesting<00:00:41.630> is<00:00:42.470> a

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
one that I found most interesting is a

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.250 
one that I found most interesting is a
new<00:00:42.980> gun<00:00:43.370> bench<00:00:43.670> which<00:00:44.390> pretty<00:00:44.690> much<00:00:44.900> allows

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
new gun bench which pretty much allows

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.400 
new gun bench which pretty much allows
you<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.770> actually<00:00:46.070> visually<00:00:47.050> customize<00:00:48.050> your

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
you to actually visually customize your

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.830 
you to actually visually customize your
weapons<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.160> also<00:00:49.610> take<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.240> look<00:00:50.540> at<00:00:50.690> them

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
weapons and also take a look at them

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.570 
weapons and also take a look at them
before<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:51.350> actually<00:00:51.380> apply<00:00:51.920> them<00:00:52.340> in-game

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
before you actually apply them in-game

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.480 
before you actually apply them in-game
now<00:00:53.450> this<00:00:53.630> is<00:00:53.780> very<00:00:53.960> similar<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.130> gun

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
now this is very similar to the gun

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.230 
now this is very similar to the gun
locker<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.270> csgo<00:00:56.630> or<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.740> gun<00:00:57.950> bench<00:00:58.220> back<00:00:58.970> in

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
locker and csgo or the gun bench back in

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.270 
locker and csgo or the gun bench back in

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
battlefield which I believe it's

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.390 
battlefield which I believe it's
actually<00:03:25.260> all<00:03:25.380> right<00:03:25.620> idea<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.070> makes<00:03:26.250> you

feel like you're actually just starting
over<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.980> maybe<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.850> improve<00:03:30.180> your

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.780 
over and maybe you can improve your
stats<00:03:30.600> overall<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.590> feel<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.400> option

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.789

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.040 
naval strike anymore
it<00:06:39.770> was<00:06:40.040> just<00:06:40.280> one<00:06:40.490> of<00:06:40.580> those<00:06:40.700> mad<00:06:41.240> DLCs<00:06:41.810> that<00:06:42.020> I

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
it was just one of those mad DLCs that I

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.740

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
probably wasn't one of those DLCs I

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.090 
probably wasn't one of those DLCs I
would<00:06:47.090> have<00:06:47.210> personally<00:06:47.480> bought<00:06:47.960> but<00:06:48.770> because

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
would have personally bought but because

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.860 
would have personally bought but because
it<00:06:49.250> was<00:06:49.370> in<00:06:49.520> pre

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
it was in pre

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.980

before<00:07:06.460> making<00:07:06.760> your<00:07:06.790> purchase<00:07:07.090> I<00:07:07.600> still<00:07:08.050> feel

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
before making your purchase I still feel

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.620 
before making your purchase I still feel
like<00:07:08.290> premium<00:07:08.680> really<00:07:09.370> needs<00:07:09.610> that<00:07:09.820> edge<00:07:10.000> to

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
like premium really needs that edge to

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.380 
like premium really needs that edge to
really<00:07:10.990> just<00:07:11.340> specify<00:07:12.340> premium<00:07:13.090> players

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
really just specify premium players

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.840 
really just specify premium players
maybe<00:07:13.840> cosmetically<00:07:14.830> I<00:07:14.860> really<00:07:15.460> like<00:07:15.670> the

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
maybe cosmetically I really like the

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.610 
maybe cosmetically I really like the
changes<00:07:16.240> that<00:07:16.750> they<00:07:16.930> were<00:07:16.990> doing<00:07:17.440> I<00:07:17.560> don't

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
changes that they were doing I don't

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.490 
changes that they were doing I don't
feel<00:07:17.920> like<00:07:18.040> the<00:07:18.160> mask<00:07:18.430> was<00:07:19.150> the<00:07:19.450> best<00:07:19.690> idea<00:07:20.050> out

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
feel like the mask was the best idea out

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.880 
feel like the mask was the best idea out
there<00:07:20.980> but<00:07:21.340> maybe<00:07:22.180> it's<00:07:22.840> a<00:07:23.080> step<00:07:23.320> in<00:07:23.560> the<00:07:23.650> right

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
there but maybe it's a step in the right

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.700 
there but maybe it's a step in the right
direction<00:07:23.920> if<00:07:24.760> they<00:07:25.000> start<00:07:25.300> to<00:07:25.450> actually<00:07:25.710> just

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
direction if they start to actually just

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.190 
direction if they start to actually just
consider<00:07:27.280> game<00:07:27.910> balance<00:07:28.330> as<00:07:28.570> a<00:07:28.600> whole<00:07:28.930> I<00:07:29.140> know

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.200 
consider game balance as a whole I know

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.470 
consider game balance as a whole I know
that<00:07:29.440> these<00:07:29.560> masks<00:07:30.010> won't<00:07:30.580> be<00:07:30.760> really<00:07:31.060> Opie

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:31.480 
that these masks won't be really Opie

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.990 
that these masks won't be really Opie
but<00:07:31.810> you<00:07:32.380> just<00:07:32.560> got<00:07:32.740> to<00:07:32.770> consider<00:07:33.190> every<00:07:33.790> one

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 
but you just got to consider every one

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.210 
but you just got to consider every one
but<00:07:34.510> I<00:07:34.570> think<00:07:34.690> that<00:07:35.350> wraps<00:07:35.560> it<00:07:35.710> up<00:07:35.830> for<00:07:35.890> today

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:36.220 
but I think that wraps it up for today

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.770 
but I think that wraps it up for today
