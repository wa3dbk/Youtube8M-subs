00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.129 
they handle it the way they addressed
that<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.650> felt<00:03:29.949> like<00:03:30.129> was<00:03:30.730> perfect<00:03:31.299> also<00:03:31.659> car

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
that I felt like was perfect also car

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.990 
that I felt like was perfect also car
was<00:03:32.319> a<00:03:32.349> relationship<00:03:32.949> of<00:03:33.099> rich<00:03:33.280> go<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.549> felt<00:03:33.879> was

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
was a relationship of rich go I felt was

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.119 
was a relationship of rich go I felt was
very<00:03:34.060> dynamic<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.139> I<00:03:35.199> loved<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.650> way<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:35.829> it

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
very dynamic and I loved the way that it

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.309 
very dynamic and I loved the way that it
ended<00:03:36.459> actually<00:03:36.639> because<00:03:37.209> normally<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.169> a

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
ended actually because normally it's a

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.500 
ended actually because normally it's a
not<00:03:38.949> to<00:03:39.099> spoil<00:03:39.489> anything<00:03:39.819> but<00:03:39.940> normally<00:03:40.389> it's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
not to spoil anything but normally it's

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.909 
not to spoil anything but normally it's
a<00:03:40.599> happy<00:03:40.989> ending<00:03:41.229> but<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.409> way<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.739> their

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
a happy ending but the way that their

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.490 
a happy ending but the way that their
relationship<00:03:42.489> ends<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.849> more<00:03:43.389> realistic<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.409> a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
relationship ends is more realistic in a

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.439 
relationship ends is more realistic in a
sense<00:03:44.769> sometimes<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.760> life<00:03:45.879> things<00:03:45.940> don't

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
sense sometimes in life things don't

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.939 
sense sometimes in life things don't
work<00:03:46.569> out<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> way<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.049> want<00:03:47.349> to<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.709> loved

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
work out the way you want to and I loved

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.559

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
how this anime addressed that harsh

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.240 
how this anime addressed that harsh

in this entire enemy his brother Jew and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.219 
in this entire enemy his brother Jew and
I<00:03:53.680> mean<00:03:53.859> he<00:03:54.220> was<00:03:54.370> slick<00:03:54.760> he<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.269> swab<00:03:55.629> he<00:03:56.079> was

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
could be and at first I thought you

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.379 
could be and at first I thought you
would<00:03:59.889> just<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.639> just<00:04:00.940> be<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.180> cool

would just be like that just be the cool

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.759 
would just be like that just be the cool
character<00:04:01.780> that<00:04:01.930> came<00:04:02.079> into<00:04:02.229> the<00:04:02.379> enemy<00:04:02.620> but

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
character that came into the enemy but

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.250 
character that came into the enemy but
no<00:04:02.949> his<00:04:03.159> character<00:04:03.609> also<00:04:03.970> has<00:04:04.329> death<00:04:04.930> his

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
no his character also has death his

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.229 
no his character also has death his
character<00:04:05.680> has<00:04:06.040> relevance<00:04:06.669> his<00:04:06.790> character

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
character has relevance his character

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.180 
character has relevance his character
has<00:04:07.449> a<00:04:07.479> development<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:08.379> I<00:04:08.470> thought<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:09.010> was

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
has a development and I thought that was

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.099 
has a development and I thought that was
really<00:04:09.459> good<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:09.909> fact<00:04:10.060> his<00:04:10.479> development<00:04:10.989> was

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
really good in fact his development was

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.469 
really good in fact his development was
very<00:04:11.409> strong<00:04:11.799> almost<00:04:12.159> every<00:04:12.849> character<00:04:13.090> in

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
very strong almost every character in

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.360 
very strong almost every character in
this<00:04:13.629> entire<00:04:13.959> enemy<00:04:14.169> has<00:04:14.560> strong<00:04:14.919> development

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
this entire enemy has strong development

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.949 
this entire enemy has strong development
I<00:04:15.609> think<00:04:15.729> the<00:04:16.060> one<00:04:16.299> character<00:04:16.659> whose

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
I think the one character whose

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.740 
I think the one character whose
development<00:04:17.349> was<00:04:17.709> kind<00:04:18.099> of<00:04:18.220> weak<00:04:18.430> was<00:04:18.909> pops<00:04:19.299> I

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
development was kind of weak was pops I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.170 
development was kind of weak was pops I
mean<00:04:20.200> we<00:04:20.440> see<00:04:20.769> him<00:04:21.010> he<00:04:21.190> plays<00:04:21.430> his<00:04:21.639> double<00:04:21.969> bass

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
mean we see him he plays his double bass

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.740 
mean we see him he plays his double bass
but<00:04:22.690> we<00:04:22.810> really<00:04:23.020> don't<00:04:23.139> know<00:04:23.380> much

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
but we really don't know much

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.720 
but we really don't know much
of<00:04:23.810> his<00:04:23.960> backstory<00:04:24.590> was<00:04:24.980> he<00:04:25.160> involved<00:04:25.430> in

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
of his backstory was he involved in

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.760 
of his backstory was he involved in
world<00:04:26.030> war<00:04:26.210> two<00:04:26.510> by<00:04:26.990> way<00:04:27.140> this<00:04:27.320> anime<00:04:27.620> takes

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
world war two by way this anime takes

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.280 
world war two by way this anime takes
place<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.190> 1966<00:04:29.150> that's<00:04:29.360> why<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:29.720> said<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.110> but

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
place in 1966 that's why I said that but

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.140 
place in 1966 that's why I said that but
we<00:04:30.710> don't<00:04:30.800> really<00:04:31.010> know<00:04:31.160> much<00:04:31.400> about<00:04:31.460> pops

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
we don't really know much about pops

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.240 
we don't really know much about pops
he's<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.900> chill<00:04:33.200> guy<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.650> jams

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
but that's not to say that it doesn't

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.120 
but that's not to say that it doesn't
have<00:04:41.570> its<00:04:41.750> fair<00:04:41.930> share<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.350> life<00:04:42.620> moments<00:04:42.890> I
