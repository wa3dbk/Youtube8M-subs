 watched the first lesson of the district look so 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 today we will analyze the first stop 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.469
 this is the step side ie we can walk 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 in different directions to the right and to the left as his 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.980
 do right that is, we raise 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.770
 leg while raising steeper and when 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.360
 lower the leg we blow off accordingly 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.360
 all this is something that inflated chest 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.700
 and with each step you do so 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.830
 that you lift your foot and tuck in 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.830
 go down with your leg 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.960
 and now we will try to do it with you 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.270
 quickly 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.600
 That looks like this 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.340
 from a small step in place that is you 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.310
 scatter your legs in different directions 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.710

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.600
 leg comes out and back it's the same leg 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 sure you need to go back to 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.660
 center with that is put the leg in 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.120
 center and hereinafter as from the center or from 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.670
 center you already push your 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.020
 leg with it all the time you 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.200
 keep your knees bent 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.030
 desirable constantly download not 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.970
 forget the pumped basics of the trench 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.930
 so you have to pump in here 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.830
 breastfeeding 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.560

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:59.190

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.810
 look bent knees and set foot 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.180

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.239
 center mandatory back while 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.060
 bent knees and sagas find their knees 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.120
 when you will be in the center and from the center 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.090
 when you go out look at the sides 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.520
 you do not put on a flat part yes that is 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.200
 parallel to set exactly back when 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:32.900
 this hands can do all that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:35.630
 want time two three 4 5 six 7 8 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.270
 have finished 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.400
 and so 3 st and aside adding jumps 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.200
 how it is done one two three and look 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.030
 carefully and repeat after me from anyone 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.380
 It turned out the first time, of course, well done 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 with this you need to raise your knee and 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.910
 bend in the same position that is not 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.550
 straightening the knee just put then 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.330
 the left foot and the right one do the same 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.480
 left foot 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.320
 let's play we raise the right set again 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.480
 right then put the left and Olya is ready 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.330
 at the same time hands you make them like a steam locomotive 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.150
 remember in childhood chukh-chukh-chukh-chukh-chukh 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.920
 that is, you have such movements and you need 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.250
 deviate in the side so it looks like 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.620
 back 2 times that is, you constantly need 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.940

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.640
 right-left to center 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.550
 center on the right for center with 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.490
 swing don't forget to bend over and 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.370
 make such small amplitude and not 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.460
 forget about hands you have to do it 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.020

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.020
