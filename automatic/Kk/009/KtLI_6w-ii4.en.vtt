00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 what's up my happy youtube happy 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.440
 and welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 today there is a new episode 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.610
 paranormal the jonathan got me one 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.380
 extremely exciting story sent 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.719
 and i thought too happy we hear 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 look at us and then decide 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.550
 what really happened there 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 and let's go hello julia I live in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.490
 a smaller town in the north 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.650
 Germany is never here 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.289
 especially busy never very busy 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.760
 except when it is safe to shoot but nevertheless 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.890
 At least you see people from time to time 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 on the street it was the fall holidays 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.399
 last year as my parents 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.380
 decided to drive to holland and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.030
 i had storm free i am single child 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 So we had our house for me 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.640
 completely alone what do you do in that way 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.590
 a situation of course a house party 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.570
 that my boy I wanted it in one 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.640
 keep a little smaller circle because you 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.870
 you know that with so many people sees it 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 House looks like a battlefield 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.070
 my parents would kill me who they are 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.989
 in such a thing so very meticulous what 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 i joined in my inner friends 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.070
 all in my city lived one 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.300
 a heavy hurricane raged in during the day 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.920
 north germany in our city 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.449
 There was also a rough breeze 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 however, she really did stay that way 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 the heavier spared that was largely 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.939
 almost as if the storm had changed 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 determined to move around us 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.689
 because the neighboring cities were not 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 spared as it was in the evening 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.900
 I still expected my buddies 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 but they did not come 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.439
 It was funny and two hours 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 passed and not one was there now 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.990
 you might think I am 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.580
 just unpopular like this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.439
 typical children but no one to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.070
 birthday comes in the movie but that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.229
 I'm not 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.759
 It surprised me why no one came good 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.770
 because of the storm maybe i thought 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.119
 But as I said it stayed with me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.100
 us really in limits 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 So look no further on whatsapp 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 had written to me they were today 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.040
 have not been online yet 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.290
 also funny that never happened 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.630
 So I called my best buddies 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.310
 no matter whether mobile or telephone but 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 no one answered it was perhaps also the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.000
 the storm that maybe the network easy 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.070
 I did not work, I thought to myself 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.970
 I did not know but I started 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.039
 to give thought 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.509
 So I just decided on one 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.770
 stop by my best friends 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.110
 the two houses lives on 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.549
 but the house left him alone 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.990
 no one there maybe they were too 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.640
 gone away but why did we do that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.860
 not told we almost told each other 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 So, what's up, I left 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.950
 a little further on the main road 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.540
 along at two more 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.760
 friends to look past me 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.959
 nobody was on the road the way 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.430
 shops had for some reason 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.180
 not closed was not a car for the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.670
 road along 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.260
 my two others wondered 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.090
 friends were not at home either 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.860
 also turns on the way back 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.450
 I met no human soul 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.220
 Of course, this is not a big city here 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.450
 but that was extremely unusual 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.910
 even for here 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 I worried the city ​​seemed to be 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.190
 to be extinct like one 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.319
 ghost town 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.849
 When I got home I looked out 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.400
 the most complete movie went to sleep afterwards 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.120
 It was relatively early when I woke up 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.190
 early in the morning 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.079
 I do not believe it was the same day 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.970
 again, as if yesterday was no day 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.569
 Did you understand that could happen 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.670
 Not be 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.319
 in the evening my friends really came 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
 great when I told him all this 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.239
 They laughed at me and held me 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.560
 for crazy but it was really 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.150
 yes dear jonathan very exciting 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.519
 history one day as the only human 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.510
 to live in the world I think so 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.400
 personally quite unlikely 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.680
 I think more about one 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.590
 So Klartraum acted in which you 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.810
 asleep which is then in this 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.430
 dream thought that would be the reality that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.780
 can you happen to me quickly that one 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.030
 something mixed and if you then 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 does not really realize that 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.819
 It can really happen 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.079
 a movie about that is called inception 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.280
 camp agrees some of mine 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.030
 Favorite movies that deals with exactly 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.350
 this theme 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.389
 I can do that personally as 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.680
 present explanation or your friends 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.170
 have somehow so lousy prank 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.790
 played and put everyone under one 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.200
 Cover somehow that would be the other one 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.579
 alternative that I explain myself so 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.060
 could but then would have to 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.440
 together the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.510
 nobody was on the road 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.620
 Who is good at such a storm? 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.120
 With a smaller city ​​can do that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.140
 These are the two of them 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.459
 possibilities i have if you 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.050
 possibilities from what happened there 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.160
 can the beaver jonathan to write 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.819
 However, in the comments I am on 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.440
 every case tense 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.700
 remember me more and more paranormal 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.920
 to send experiences I need that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.569
 always for this format yes that was it 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.640
 from me what can only say my 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.640
 world is evil and fits
