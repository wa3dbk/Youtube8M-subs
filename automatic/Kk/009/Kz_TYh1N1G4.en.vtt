00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.589 
just like it to make a lego core machine
it<00:00:10.410> took<00:00:10.590> me<00:00:10.650> right<00:00:11.009> three<00:00:11.490> hours<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.360> finish

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
it took me right three hours to finish

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.589 
it took me right three hours to finish
it<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.920> pretty<00:00:14.460> cool<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.059> put<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> load<00:00:15.570> of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
little mega figures inside in that so it

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
little mega figures inside in that so it
basically<00:00:21.890> basically<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.490> where<00:00:23.790> you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
basically basically this is where you

basically when you open it up I mean

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.480 
basically when you open it up I mean

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and you have your cloth I know it's not

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.100 
and you have your cloth I know it's not
like<00:00:38.970> a<00:00:39.000> proper<00:00:39.270> claw<00:00:39.540> machine<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
like a proper claw machine with the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
like a proper claw machine with the
joystick<00:00:40.560> and<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.130> I<00:00:41.280> made<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.760> claw

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
joystick and that but I made this claw

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.800 
joystick and that but I made this claw
we're<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.560> you<00:00:44.100> pull<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> back<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> forth

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
we're like you pull it back and forth

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.740 
we're like you pull it back and forth
like<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:47.010> cut<00:00:47.220> open<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.670> close<00:00:47.880> it<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
like that to cut open and close it so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.430 
like that to cut open and close it so
i'll<00:00:49.050> probably<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.640> quick<00:00:51.440> go

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
i'll probably just do a really quick go

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
i'll probably just do a really quick go
on<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> i'll<00:00:53.160> try<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.700> make<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.480> camera<00:00:54.870> i'm

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
on it and i'll try and make a camera i'm

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.870 
on it and i'll try and make a camera i'm
going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> try<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.560> Turtwig<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.700> is

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
going to try and go for Turtwig which is

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.420 
going to try and go for Turtwig which is
there<00:00:57.150> alright<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.620> basically<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
there alright so basically you can just

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
there alright so basically you can just
go<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.090> top<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:01.130> grab<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.989> then<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> will

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
go the top and then grab it then it will

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
go the top and then grab it then it will
have<00:01:04.320> him<00:01:05.300> then<00:01:07.280> yeah<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> top<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
have him then yeah if it had the top and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
have him then yeah if it had the top and
then<00:01:09.720> it'd<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:10.020> harder<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.250> should<00:01:11.400> let

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
then it'd be harder and you should let

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.370 
then it'd be harder and you should let
go<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.540> drops<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:13.130> call<00:01:14.130> goes<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
go it drops down call goes back there I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.550 
go it drops down call goes back there I
don't<00:01:16.380> matter<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.799> way<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.220> goes<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:22.350> open

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
don't matter what way it goes then open

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.730 
don't matter what way it goes then open
it<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:23.330> put<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.450> hand<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.260> lot<00:01:31.440> harder

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it up put your hand in it's a lot harder

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.140 
it up put your hand in it's a lot harder
and<00:01:32.190> then<00:01:32.220> there's<00:01:32.580> like<00:01:32.760> angry<00:01:33.119> birds

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and then there's like angry birds

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780 
and then there's like angry birds
mash'ems<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.260> I<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.760> a
