responding<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.719> their<00:01:03.899> work<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.439> course<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
responding to their work of course I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
responding to their work of course I
understand<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.290> tools<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
understand that there are more tools to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.100 
understand that there are more tools to
use<00:01:07.830> during<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> response<00:01:08.790> step<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
use during the response step but i think

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
use during the response step but i think
i<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.290> make<00:01:10.619> progress<00:01:11.010> by<00:01:11.520> working<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
i can make progress by working on

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
i can make progress by working on
rubrics<00:01:12.650> what<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> suggest<00:01:14.100> about

revision<00:01:15.330> well<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.400> two

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
revision well I think there are two

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
revision well I think there are two
tools<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.240> start<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.600> adding<00:01:19.170> details

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
tools I would start with adding details

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
tools I would start with adding details
and<00:01:20.369> using<00:01:20.729> six<00:01:21.030> traits<00:01:21.350> do<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> have

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and using six traits do you have

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.830 
and using six traits do you have
information<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.700> both<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.210> tools<00:01:24.509> add

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
information for both of these tools add

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
information for both of these tools add
in<00:01:25.619> details<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.670> simple<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.270> asking

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
in details can be as simple as asking

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
in details can be as simple as asking
students<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> add<00:01:28.590> an<00:01:28.710> adjective<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.670> least

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
five of the nouns in there sa or it can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
five of the nouns in there sa or it can
be<00:01:32.729> adding<00:01:33.210> words<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.659> remind<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.229> readers
