think<00:04:03.100> three<00:04:03.490> key<00:04:04.090> areas<00:04:04.300> just<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.780> think

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
think three key areas just to think

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.600 
think three key areas just to think
about<00:04:05.110> geopolitically<00:04:06.040> they<00:04:06.190> do<00:04:06.250> offer

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
stability in the region and i think

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.400 
stability in the region and i think
