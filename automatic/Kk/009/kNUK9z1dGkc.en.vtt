00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.370
 The sun has changed a bit today 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.410
 hard done here by the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 to get through haze 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 but now she seems in full force 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.930
 and it was nice too 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 here and I am here now 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.279
 Upper Austria in the machland still and if 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.600
 one looks at the mountains then 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 you can see I am looking against the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 voralpen direction lower austria like 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.539
 It's clear that everything is still going on now 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 a bit on it but it is on 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.550
 In the afternoon it is super clear that makes 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.530
 the dryer dries everything off and only if 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 the hair dryer so strong can be seen here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 This view of the Alps is so beautiful in the Alps 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.520
 north and northwest looks different 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.950
 in germany there is already the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.840
 Once cold front partly because rains 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
 attracts even especially in the northwest 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.070
 right now center and yes we 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.199
 want us on the graphics now 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 what the colleagues of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.750
 weather online yesterday already in the ticker 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.850
 brought what happened there we see 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 here a blue arrow and two red ones 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 Arrows of red is the red arrows 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.070
 Meet this warm dry air and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 arrow marks the cold front and the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 But the fÃ¶hn blocks this cold front 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.729
 does not work that way in the south and southeast 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030
 right ahead 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.900
 and that will last until about 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 sunday evening sunday night 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.479
 but that's the cold front of this cold front 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.930
 by bringing us a temperature fall 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.540
 of 20 degrees in about then if we now 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.369
 dazzle on the artwork of sunday then 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.450
 you can see the blue arrows have the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.329
 won over 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 it breaks here the keltereien and us 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.070
 drive to the line where the southwest 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.450
 Come in tomorrow we will be together 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 watch crisis when the people 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.750
 hopefully enjoy the nice weather 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.659
 and then it's really spitzingsee 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.970
 about 1300 meters and then there should 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.799
 to strike the cold of really because 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.200
 this is definitely a field where it is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.180
 Snowfall is always in the valleys 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.820
 will partially mix snow 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 but at this height everything will be as 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.159
 snow fall 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.320
 the only advantage is the fields are 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.239
 all the farmers are waiting very dry here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.370
 the fact that it has finally raining he 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.900
 much too little rain since the beginning of the year 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.090
 and 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.170
 We can hope for that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.459
 also its advantages 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.439
 I am now on the way direction 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.599
 west and then sign me up in the ticker 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.920
 again and we look at what is in 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.920
 developed here these next days
