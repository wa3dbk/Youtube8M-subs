lot<00:02:34.460> of<00:02:35.290> pulling<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.530> wet<00:02:37.010> hops<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.670> I'm

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
lot of pulling out wet hops when I'm

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.290 
lot of pulling out wet hops when I'm
getting<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.020> chilled<00:02:39.760> work<00:02:40.760> into<00:02:41.180> the

fermenter I'm gonna have to have a

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.990 
fermenter I'm gonna have to have a
strainer<00:02:44.120> bag<00:02:44.450> strain<00:02:45.260> them<00:02:45.410> out<00:02:45.530> but<00:02:46.000> there

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
strainer bag strain them out but there

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.730 
strainer bag strain them out but there
you<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:47.300> that's<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> first<00:02:48.170> bit<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.620> then

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
you go that's the first bit and then

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.290 
you go that's the first bit and then
I'll<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.010> about<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.490> many<00:02:49.700> more<00:02:49.940> one<00:02:50.240> more

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
time what I did this year is just used

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170 
time what I did this year is just used
all<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.750> my<00:02:53.780> cascades<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.220> wet<00:02:55.400> hop<00:02:55.610> batch

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
all of my cascades in the wet hop batch

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.430 
all of my cascades in the wet hop batch
but<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.680> my<00:02:58.070> Centennial<00:02:58.760> spread<00:02:59.150> which

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
but this is my Centennial spread which

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.600 
but this is my Centennial spread which
you<00:03:00.440> know<00:03:00.880> it's<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.970> nice<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:03.350> will<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.740> I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
you know it's a nice this will be I

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.970 
you know it's a nice this will be I
don't<00:03:04.760> know<00:03:04.850> 6<00:03:05.180> ounces<00:03:05.630> dried<00:03:05.960> maybe<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.680> I'll

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
don't know 6 ounces dried maybe so I'll

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.130 
don't know 6 ounces dried maybe so I'll
have<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.460> more<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.820> package<00:03:08.270> up<00:03:08.450> and

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
have a little bit more to package up and

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.979 
have a little bit more to package up and
use<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.770> some<00:03:10.100> other<00:03:10.220> bench<00:03:10.540> all<00:03:11.540> right<00:03:11.810> it's

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
use in some other bench all right it's

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.310 
use in some other bench all right it's
45<00:03:12.530> minutes<00:03:12.590> into<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.970> boil<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:14.720> 15<00:03:15.200> minutes

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
45 minutes into the boil so 15 minutes

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.770 
45 minutes into the boil so 15 minutes
remain<00:03:15.860> we've<00:03:16.100> dumped<00:03:16.459> in<00:03:16.900> one<00:03:17.900> bucket<00:03:19.780> which

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
remain we've dumped in one bucket which

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.090 
remain we've dumped in one bucket which
is<00:03:20.810> about<00:03:21.260> three<00:03:22.450> no<00:03:23.450> seven<00:03:24.200> ounces<00:03:24.530> wet<00:03:24.860> and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
is about three no seven ounces wet and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.430 
is about three no seven ounces wet and
then<00:03:25.850> there<00:03:26.239> goes<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.420> other<00:03:26.690> eight<00:03:27.050> ounces

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
then there goes the other eight ounces

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.330 
then there goes the other eight ounces
wet<00:03:28.600> mashing<00:03:29.600> them<00:03:29.690> down<00:03:30.580> keeping<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.760> rolling

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
wet mashing them down keeping it rolling

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
wet mashing them down keeping it rolling
all<00:03:34.340> right<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:35.000> are<00:03:35.150> done<00:03:35.420> except<00:03:35.930> for<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
all right we are done except for the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.830 
all right we are done except for the
cleanup<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:36.680> here's<00:03:36.860> my<00:03:36.920> spent<00:03:37.519> hops<00:03:37.850> which

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
cleanup but here's my spent hops which

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.210 
cleanup but here's my spent hops which
is<00:03:39.290> about<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.430> much<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.690> bucket<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.290> you

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
is about that much in this bucket of you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.990 
is about that much in this bucket of you
know<00:03:43.340> compressed<00:03:43.900> what<00:03:44.900> hops<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.709> Rob<00:03:46.459> still

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
know compressed what hops and Rob still

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.350 
know compressed what hops and Rob still
helping<00:03:47.510> me<00:03:47.800> we<00:03:48.800> got<00:03:49.070> five<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.330> half

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
helping me we got five and a half

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.509 
helping me we got five and a half
gallons<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.410> work<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.950> gravity<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.489> a

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
gallons of work so the gravity is a

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.850 
gallons of work so the gravity is a
little<00:03:52.790> bit<00:03:52.940> lower<00:03:53.209> than<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.320> was<00:03:54.470> hoping<00:03:54.680> for

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
little bit lower than I was hoping for

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.080 
little bit lower than I was hoping for
it's<00:03:55.160> 1070<00:03:55.910> which<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.750> not<00:03:56.900> bad<00:03:57.489> but<00:03:58.489> if<00:03:58.820> I

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
it's 1070 which is not bad but if I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.550 
it's 1070 which is not bad but if I
would<00:03:59.150> have<00:03:59.300> had<00:03:59.480> five<00:03:59.750> gallons<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.290> figured

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
would have had five gallons I figured

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.490 
would have had five gallons I figured
out<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.800> would<00:04:00.890> have<00:04:00.980> been<00:04:01.100> ten<00:04:01.310> seventy<00:04:01.670> seven

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
out it would have been ten seventy seven

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.009 
out it would have been ten seventy seven
so<00:04:03.500> here<00:04:03.709> we<00:04:03.830> go<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:04.310> got<00:04:04.459> five<00:04:06.940> five<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.360> a

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
so here we go we got five five and a

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.690 
so here we go we got five five and a
half<00:04:09.200> gallon<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:09.830> I'll<00:04:09.950> have<00:04:10.130> some<00:04:10.310> blow-off<00:04:10.489> I

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
half gallon so I'll have some blow-off I

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.910 
half gallon so I'll have some blow-off I
got<00:04:10.850> some<00:04:11.030> nice<00:04:11.209> things<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> corner<00:04:12.200> here

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
got some nice things in the corner here

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.620 
got some nice things in the corner here
and<00:04:12.950> then<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.400> put<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.730> blanket<00:04:14.150> over<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.450> top

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
and then I put this blanket over the top

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.289 
and then I put this blanket over the top
but<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.980> yeah<00:04:15.980> maybe<00:04:16.310> I'll<00:04:16.489> do<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.669> tasting

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
but I yeah maybe I'll do a tasting

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.390 
but I yeah maybe I'll do a tasting
review<00:04:17.479> in<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.380> few<00:04:18.710> weeks<00:04:18.830> when<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.250> all
