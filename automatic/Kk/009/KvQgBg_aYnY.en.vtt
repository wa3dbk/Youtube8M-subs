00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the dead even scary and why was not a da

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830 
the dead even scary and why was not a da
boss<00:00:56.190> some<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.579> similar<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> where<00:00:57.270> George

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
boss some be similar to where George

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
boss some be similar to where George
know<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.230> he<00:00:58.289> didn't<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> make<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
know if he didn't want it to make it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.299 
know if he didn't want it to make it
even<00:00:59.699> more<00:00:59.940> scarier<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:01.050> call<00:01:01.710> off<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> dead

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
even more scarier than call off the dead

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
even more scarier than call off the dead
so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.120> definitely<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so I think this could definitely be a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.600 
so I think this could definitely be a
boss<00:01:04.409> zombie<00:01:04.830> looks<00:01:05.040> different<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
boss zombie looks different to all the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
boss zombie looks different to all the
other<00:01:05.729> zombies<00:01:06.119> no<00:01:06.720> rips<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.110> his<00:01:07.229> clothes

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
other zombies no rips and his clothes

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
other zombies no rips and his clothes
nose<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.159> no<00:01:08.340> blood<00:01:08.610> everywhere<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.299> think

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
nose got no blood everywhere I think

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
nose got no blood everywhere I think
this<00:01:09.869> definitely<00:01:10.080> could<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> boss<00:01:10.979> zombie

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
this definitely could be the boss zombie

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.950 
this definitely could be the boss zombie
know<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:11.850> could<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.750> actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.249 
too sure if you look at his hands they
look<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.110> look

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
look kind of I don't know they look

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230

and mayo did you know doesn't look like
you<00:01:25.110> could<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.439> anything<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.580> never<00:01:26.700> know

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you could do anything but we never know

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.370 
you could do anything but we never know
so<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.600> could<00:01:27.780> definitely<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so i think this could definitely be the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039 
so i think this could definitely be the
last<00:01:28.770> zombie<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.759> besides<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> boss<00:01:30.509> tambien

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
last zombie now besides the boss tambien

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.810 
last zombie now besides the boss tambien
normal<00:01:31.470> zombies<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> also<00:01:32.220> looks<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.610> we've

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
normal zombies it also looks like we've

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.550 
normal zombies it also looks like we've
got<00:01:32.850> something<00:01:33.299> else<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.470> looks

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
got something else now to me this looks

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
got something else now to me this looks
like<00:01:34.890> an<00:01:35.070> upgraded<00:01:35.640> version<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
like an upgraded version of the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
like an upgraded version of the
hellhounds<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.650> look<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.340> back

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
hellhounds if you look right at the back

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
hellhounds if you look right at the back
and<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.030> over<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.329> watch<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> little

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and if you go over and watch that little

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
and if you go over and watch that little
clip<00:01:40.380> again<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.670> we've<00:01:41.909> got
