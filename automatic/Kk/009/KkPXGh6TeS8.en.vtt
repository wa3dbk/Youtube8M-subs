00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
chameleon and then you change it up

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.260 
chameleon and then you change it up
variable<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:47.350> fine<00:01:47.619> if<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.880> know<00:01:48.969> if<00:01:49.119> it

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
variable so it's fine if you know if it

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.330 
variable so it's fine if you know if it
didn't<00:01:49.479> look<00:01:49.600> great<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.200> got<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.560> way<00:01:50.740> because

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
didn't look great I got the way because

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.980 
didn't look great I got the way because
you<00:01:51.549> know<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.700> do<00:01:51.880> what<00:01:52.149> I<00:01:52.180> have<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.450> do<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.869> way

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
you know I do what I have to do the way

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.510 
you know I do what I have to do the way
and<00:01:53.259> that's<00:01:53.649> that's<00:01:53.859> going<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.159> be<00:01:54.250> an<00:01:54.340> end<00:01:54.490> to

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and that's that's going to be an end to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.289 
and that's that's going to be an end to
fight<00:01:54.759> when<00:01:54.909> its<00:01:55.119> benefit<00:01:55.600> or<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:55.929> absolutely
