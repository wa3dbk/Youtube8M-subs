 in order to safeguard the 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.920
 biodiversity of our planet creating 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.960
 bridges between gastronomy and ethics 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.330
 from vines collaborates with the foundation 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.690
 slow food through the project of 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.730
 more than 400 garrisons exist in the world 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.100
 slow food presidia that support 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.900
 more technically and financially than 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.330
 10 thousand small producers so that 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.789
 can continue to produce plants 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.290
 typical of specific places contrasting 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.480
 the disappearance of a genetic heritage 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.640
 of priceless biological value 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.649
 each family of essentia larcher 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 contains a specific ingredient 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.250
 active of Mediterranean origin 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.710
 coming from a slow food presidium 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.480
 behind which is the story the face and 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.840
 the name of those who have cultivated it with care 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 and passion 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.770
 the known story goes back to some 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.650
 millennium ago every invader left a 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.680
 this territory to its people of the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.130
 knowledge of knowledge and also of things 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.130
 materials of that almond tree are 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.229
 raised as a child in the almond and e 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.770
 in the production laboratories of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.850
 a confectionery company has been for me 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.800
 the cradle of my olfactory sensations 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.060
 sensory and my passions that gives 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 adult affected 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.740
 in the early 90s when slow 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.720
 food launched the operation presidi slow 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.899
 then food products to put underneath 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.539
 conservation protection we do 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.899
 promoters of the almond-known garrison 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.880
 which affects the Roman cultivar that 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.660
 risked disappearing from the almond grove 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 traditional 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.950
 and if I do n't know a curious story is born 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.370
 when anna maria d'orlÃ©ans nephew of kings 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.340
 louis xiv the sun king was given in marriage to 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.470
 vittorio amedeo ii came here in one 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.050
 hunting lodge of stupinigi ha 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.540
 imported from tours of the plants and gods 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.940
 celery seed voters tour and with the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.400
 time this seem violet has tacked 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.250
 from purple to red either 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.360
 acclimatized and remained so by now i 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.750
 200 years we decided to recover the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.069
 cultivar for a matter typically 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.510
 territorial and thanks to this too 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.730
 all the orbassanese now go 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.780
 proud and we have become great 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.870
 family for this 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.870
 here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.500
 my family has been dealing for generations 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.349
 my great-great-grandfathers have always 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.459
 cultivated the olive is only olive 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.709
 minute thanks to the features 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.260
 landscapers to the monumentality of plants 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.420
 this variety has been chosen for 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.110
 set up a slow food facility for the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.409
 biodiversity the cultivation of this 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.849
 culture continues the emotional bond with 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.829
 territory also with sacrifices we try 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.889
 to keep it from carrying on 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.739
 above all not to leave the area 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.260
 maybe where one is having dinner and keeping 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.889
 also the territory also safeguarding 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.889
 by the tenant 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.040
 caprauna is a small village inland 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.760
 of Liguria in Piedmont and the 1000s 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 meters 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.230
 a bit of passion a little for love a little 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.270
 for those who still need to do it anyway 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.910
 something for what one believes 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.520
 line started again after Saturdays 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.780
 and Sunday to make us the garden do it all 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.660
 the rest to come and put the ramps 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.889
 the principals are the things cultivated in 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.750
 place where they have that kind of color of 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.790
 taste of taste that cannot be 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.630
 reproduced in other places and uniqueness 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.630
 of the thing
