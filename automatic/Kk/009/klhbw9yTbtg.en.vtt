know what I need to step it up a notch I
need<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> prove<00:00:14.910> myself<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.389> them<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
need to prove myself to them so I

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.689 
need to prove myself to them so I
decided<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.560> pack<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:17.010> my<00:00:17.039> things<00:00:17.369> from<00:00:17.520> my

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
of those clocks that just won't shut up

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.720 
of those clocks that just won't shut up
I<00:02:08.759> could<00:02:09.759> catch<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.239> go<00:02:10.539> take<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.899> out

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730

which has really been around for a few
centuries<00:02:32.349> now<00:02:32.830> was<00:02:33.670> too<00:02:33.940> much<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
centuries now was too much for the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.309 
centuries now was too much for the
studying<00:02:36.220> medical<00:02:36.549> students<00:02:37.120> mind<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.870> they

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
studying medical students mind and they

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.729 
studying medical students mind and they
I<00:02:38.590> don't<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.250> Jan<00:02:39.519> maybe<00:02:39.700> by<00:02:40.230> sheer<00:02:41.230> force<00:02:41.260> of

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
I don't know Jan maybe by sheer force of

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.930 
I don't know Jan maybe by sheer force of
will<00:02:41.849> they<00:02:42.849> started<00:02:43.209> falling<00:02:43.720> off<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.200> wall

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
will they started falling off the wall

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.590 
will they started falling off the wall
from<00:02:45.940> anger<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.370> torment<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.450> can

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
from anger and torment and I can

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:03.480 
from anger and torment and I can
understand<00:02:50.019> that

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.630 

now<00:03:04.090> Camtasia<00:03:04.780> works<00:03:05.110> as<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.920> screen<00:03:06.310> capture

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
now Camtasia works as a screen capture

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.270 
now Camtasia works as a screen capture
anything<00:03:07.420> that's<00:03:07.750> there<00:03:07.960> is<00:03:08.200> captured<00:03:09.070> in

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
anything that's there is captured in

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.200 
anything that's there is captured in
this<00:03:10.030> case<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.720> cursor<00:03:11.050> was<00:03:11.260> not<00:03:11.560> captured

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
this case the cursor was not captured

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.540 
this case the cursor was not captured
but<00:03:13.210> one<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.630> one<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.590> our<00:03:14.710> favorite<00:03:15.160> medical

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
but one of one of our favorite medical

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.460 
but one of one of our favorite medical
students<00:03:16.030> actually<00:03:16.210> a<00:03:16.390> few<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.780> them<00:03:16.900> asked<00:03:17.410> if

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
students actually a few of them asked if

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.700 
students actually a few of them asked if
I<00:03:17.590> could<00:03:17.650> digitally<00:03:18.310> insert<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:19.440> cursor<00:03:20.440> into

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
I could digitally insert a cursor into

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.540 
I could digitally insert a cursor into
every<00:03:21.310> single<00:03:21.670> frame<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.780> Camtasia<00:03:23.550> which

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
every single frame of Camtasia which

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.960 
every single frame of Camtasia which
would<00:03:24.760> take<00:03:25.200> would<00:03:26.200> take<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.740> good<00:03:27.550> three<00:03:27.940> to

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
would take would take a good three to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.390 
would take would take a good three to
four<00:03:28.360> hours
