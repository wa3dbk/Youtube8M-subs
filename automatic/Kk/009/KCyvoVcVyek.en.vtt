00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.910
 Make time that is welcome caps size 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.740
 more is clear of the way if you by 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.719
 have lost some of the largest institution 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.010
 that has the complete playlist 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.240
 If you are continuing the area is 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.610
 want to send there and leave a 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.710
 comment I'm almost coming back from 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.320
 travel soon I will read all 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
 comments but the path remains firm and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.539
 strong 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.350
 You could see that we needed to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 sides to rest the Congo and the uefa 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.300
 patrice evra we bought there explained and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 the maicon two roma players 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
 solid players 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.440
 in general I was very much in doubt if I 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.290
 I took the CÃ¡ceres or the castan 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 I chose the rhythm but I think 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 that the chestnut quarterback best if I 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 to go back in time maybe I 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 would have left castan in the team 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 Any way you can see that I 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 I bought two explained I was seeing the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.629
 any market price to sell the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 according to 950 and the average of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.120
 market by 1800 and not only had by 1,600 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.399
 then this was still one one house 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.229
 treatment then I put the price 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.460
 slightly higher than the market average and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.260
 our other explained that he had already 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.939
 bought I put it a little bit down 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 of the market average so that I 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.630
 could sell the two players more 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 As I said apart from the profits with 3d 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.710
 They will stay ahead because they were 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 recording all matches before 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.270
 My trip and we went straight I 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.770
 play another match with our 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.080
 two new players 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.799
 the maicon and the body did not like it very well 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.100
 from both 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.470
 the two with aaa the stay statement 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.030
 back in the attack worked very well in 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 position them either side not 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.659
 we have measured on the left to make the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 run the field function 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.579
 our opponent again the bh team I 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.729
 I was worried and want a very 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.590
 similar to kossack negredo and benzema no 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.820
 Attack is much lost in rhythm 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.549
 you need to have at least one attacker 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.290
 good pace I think he put the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.960
 negredo with even with the letter of 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.090
 attribution of the ai that increase the pass 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 to see if he could play better 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 make a two with the benzema maybe not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 I know but what matters is that we 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.829
 we got a lot of pressure and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.570
 we started with a lot of pressure this match 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.459
 in the first time we already had 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.080
 two clear chances to score two with 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.030
 to have done a long time should have scored 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.740
 and that's what I did in that without much 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.100
 I went to try to make the goal 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.350
 Oh my God, we're back with heaven. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.330
 I will not know, but our opponent 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.220
 was extremely competent he is 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.120
 very calm their team knew a lot 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.250
 well what were you doing? 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.050
 but he did not count on what he or 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 started and the counterattack he got me 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.340
 proposed a poor one just waited the hour that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.410
 I would know that he was going to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 Advance a little left protects and here 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.720
 I went to the insurance finesse with the leg 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.640
 Good, I did not want to invent but I knew 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 he was going out with his attackers and the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.600
 Polga did what she should have done 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.270
 assistance proteges after that we 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.250
 we managed to keep the score very well in the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.300
 first time we had this tie 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.210
 you could see that our opponent had 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.100
 a single goal chance during the 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.290
 first full time and here another one 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.490
 time we continued on the attack and a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.410
 thing that I already said the song 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.380
 I'll tell you again not 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.780
 be afraid to start the game again 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.790
 did not give back side touches 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.020
 were if you look for space which by the way 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.150
 I almost traveled 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.890
 the fallen marcelo almost stole ball but 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.050
 do not be afraid to wait the right time 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.970
 You do not have to force yourself to start the game again. 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.310
 That after a while I ended up 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.840
 thinking of rossi and one of us is to protect her 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.550
 This ball protects her interest that she 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.340
 protect the team knew why he 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.280
 got the robot with all its aggressiveness 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.780
 and made another goal for us was right 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.520
 that although I might not know how it was 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.410
 stop at Higuain but what matters is that 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.930
 the tevez got here soon our 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.550
 opponent has the 85 minutes is not 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.440
 getting nothing because the team is 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.510
 running very well defensively and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.130
 he was advancing too much oil tags 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.030
 how aggressive he is extremely 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.190
 aggressive 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.680
 left for him to fit the third goal 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.930
 87 minutes there without a doubt the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.700
 guide is who takes the hat for the test is 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.470
 two plays that show all your 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.450
 aggression all his will to 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.970
 play here our opponent maybe 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.680
 his most dangerous defense 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.750
 well our goalkeeper wanted until he let 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.250
 some novit because they only see the bids 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.150
 it doing stupid things and it seems that 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.320
 horrible player 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.390
 in fact he is an excellent keeper 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.340
 but from time to time it fails and here the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.670
 I challenge the great tevez more than 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.030
 deservedly nemeth without a doubt 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.310
 played 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.760
 his almost perfect game with 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.700
 this win we won the title we 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.919
 this season is practically 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.180
 taking that our defeat of the other 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.160
 episode the people 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.860
 worked very well and won the title 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.169
 and we went up in division what I wanted 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.520
 do before playing the seventh division I 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.340
 I wanted to see if we won the tournament 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.870
 so I went to play an online tournament 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.979
 keep an eye on the back that gradually 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.380
 episodes will see them rising 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.120
 but this was all one day and after a 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.470
 day you will see the profit that people 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.300
 did but does not matter 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.860
 let's talk about gameplay but was looking for 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.990
 The game, I did not pay attention. 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.699
 enough to realize that the 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.680
 opponent is 5 behind if I 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.229
 I knew I would have come back because I 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.900
 I like to play games with you at the far end 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.729
 against five in the back is a kind of 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.910
 information that in my opinion left 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.530
 very stopped I saw that puzzle 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.599
 would occur or that very game 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.449
 stopped midfield so it 's a thing 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.220
 I do not like it very much but still 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.160
 to do what if I had just accepted 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.590
 and we were playing that first match is 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.479
 This is a good move, my God. 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.210
 Kind of a throw up boredom only with the others. 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.949
 This is not to say that the guy was 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.199
 totally lucky shit because the team 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.039
 did twice in the past episode but the 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.229
 that matters here is a way 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.970
 extremely frustrating conceded a goal 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.060
 when you have a guy with 5 behind 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.310
 because within three minutes of the game he 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.720
 It was part of blas he has no option. 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.460
 here inside the stadium to do 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.139
 one change I did not get the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.449
 Dude played the ball alone without me asking. 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.400
 but still this ball was left in the foot 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.039
 palace palace is very good but 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.360
 got the equalizer in the 78th minute and I 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.150
 I really wanted the game to go to 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.400
 Extending I wanted to hold the tie 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.380
 because I 'm not despite the goal and not 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.990
 I was playing very well and was not much. 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.449
 cool for me I had some had one 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.130
 Good chance to tell the truth is 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.900
 That was this quarter Tevez but he 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.820
 was prevented and I already knew by 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.229
 this he could not conclude 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.539
 after a superb play by 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.400
 Carlos Tevez I could detect this 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.740
 and I did not take advantage of my 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.570
 chance is that square to my god 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.949
 Heaven , I do not know why he dominated the 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.020
 To play I was losing the 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.389
 touch the time and here the trolley was not 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.759
 The technician did not work and I 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:30.120
 I ended up suffering a goal in the 90 minutes 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:33.630
 against a guy in the lineup if 15 behind 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.900
 to that moment it was like oh my god 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.990
 I did not even have time to 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.610
 following was a victory a very defeat 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.099
 sad 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.250
 because unlike the other I do not think 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:50.599
 That was our catch I missed was by 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.800
 We vacillated and left the guy like 5 in the 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:53.870
 hurts me to win 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.000
 But what is it that you have to learn from 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.460
 This defeat to see that I can of ball 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.870
 need to kick your future better mine 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.370
 uncle was from out of the area because he 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.409
 did not get space to play with his 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.210
 only two attackers but the only thing 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.909
 What you have to do is take things off. 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.830
 learn from this error and prevent them from 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.629
 Happen again I really wanted 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.669
 to win this tournament so I went 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.500
 direct to play one more match of the tournament 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.900
 I think the team had milk. 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.000
 enough for us to get if you like 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.400
 and through and how I lost not 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.620
 I could blame neither the players nor I 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.779
 was not to test better to know if 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.490
 this team has enough to win the 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:30.289
 then because of this I 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.389
 I decided to go into it again and if you 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:34.520
 want to see the first match today 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:36.889

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.840
 has a double episode munching on lic 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:43.520
 that even today I can second episode 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.930
 Sunday double episode Sunday because 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.370
 It's not because I'm traveling that I 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.990
 I'm not looking at the comments in the 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.509

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.550

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.440

 game since the first game of this tournament 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.150

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:13.750
