00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
reviewing their galactic energy pins

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.470 
reviewing their galactic energy pins
which<00:00:25.189> basically<00:00:25.640> cosmic<00:00:26.480> energy<00:00:27.460> typo<00:00:28.480> no

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
which basically cosmic energy typo no

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.900 
which basically cosmic energy typo no
galactic<00:00:30.189> galactic<00:00:31.189> first<00:00:31.430> is<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.700> name<00:00:31.849> of

galactic galactic first is the name of

galactic galactic first is the name of
one<00:00:32.029> flavor<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.840> wormhole<00:00:33.380> is<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.560> nucleus<00:00:34.040> a

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
one flavor and wormhole is a nucleus a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.210 
one flavor and wormhole is a nucleus a
active<00:00:34.850> burst<00:00:35.060> is<00:00:35.360> buried<00:00:35.810> and<00:00:36.290> where<00:00:36.680> mole<00:00:36.980> is

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
active burst is buried and where mole is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.400 
active burst is buried and where mole is
one<00:00:37.640> minute<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.300> whole<00:00:38.480> out<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.900> whole<00:00:39.079> thing

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
one minute the whole out the whole thing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.290 
one minute the whole out the whole thing
-<00:00:39.620> they're<00:00:40.100> supposed<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.430> be<00:00:40.610> caffeine

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
- they're supposed to be caffeine

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.030 
- they're supposed to be caffeine
infused<00:00:41.570> in<00:00:41.899> them<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:42.320> they<00:00:42.440> actually<00:00:42.590> do<00:00:42.860> say

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
infused in them but they actually do say

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.979 
infused in them but they actually do say
cosmic<00:00:43.550> energy<00:00:43.910> on<00:00:44.060> them<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:44.450> think<00:00:44.480> that's<00:00:44.750> the

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
cosmic energy on them I think that's the

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.650 
cosmic energy on them I think that's the
line<00:00:45.969> galactic<00:00:46.969> person<00:00:47.329> weren't<00:00:47.539> more

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
line galactic person weren't more

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.569 
line galactic person weren't more
probably<00:00:47.960> just<00:00:48.109> part<00:00:48.289> of<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.410> flavor<00:00:48.559> but<00:00:49.550> uh

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
probably just part of the flavor but uh

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.849 
probably just part of the flavor but uh
I<00:00:50.030> have<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.719> wormhole<00:00:51.710> watermelon<00:00:52.219> one<00:00:52.449> yeah

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
I have the wormhole watermelon one yeah

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.919 
I have the wormhole watermelon one yeah
as<00:00:54.859> far<00:00:55.070> as<00:00:55.160> their<00:00:55.309> patient<00:00:55.670> goes<00:00:55.820> it's<00:00:56.750> just

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
as far as their patient goes it's just

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.049 
as far as their patient goes it's just
cheap<00:00:57.530> plastic<00:00:57.980> little<00:00:58.280> rubber<00:00:58.460> stopper<00:00:59.000> that

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
cheap plastic little rubber stopper that

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.919 
cheap plastic little rubber stopper that
holds<00:00:59.539> the<00:00:59.690> pins<00:00:59.989> inside<00:01:01.210> not<00:01:02.210> too<00:01:02.390> big

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
holds the pins inside not too big

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.390 
holds the pins inside not too big
nice<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.679> case<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:04.100> guess<00:01:04.900> maybe<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.140> big<00:01:06.400> as

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
nice of a case I guess maybe the big as

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.950 
nice of a case I guess maybe the big as
far<00:01:07.610> as<00:01:07.730> like<00:01:07.850> advertising<00:01:08.450> they're<00:01:08.720> pretty

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
far as like advertising they're pretty

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.190 
far as like advertising they're pretty
good<00:01:09.200> it's<00:01:09.500> not<00:01:09.680> too<00:01:10.010> over-the-top<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:12.110> know

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
good it's not too over-the-top you know

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.320 
good it's not too over-the-top you know
it's<00:01:12.350> simple<00:01:12.500> nice<00:01:13.430> they<00:01:13.880> got<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.180> nice

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's simple nice they got the nice

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.880 
it's simple nice they got the nice
shoulder<00:01:14.630> mount<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:14.960> bottom<00:01:15.290> these<00:01:15.830> are

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
shoulder mount that bottom these are

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.460 
shoulder mount that bottom these are
different<00:01:16.250> like<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.400> higher<00:01:16.550> end<00:01:16.760> pin<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.900> have

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
different like a higher end pin I have

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.080 
different like a higher end pin I have
definitely<00:01:18.620> like<00:01:18.890> these<00:01:19.010> ones<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.550> think<00:01:19.970> they

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
definitely like these ones I think they

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.970 
definitely like these ones I think they
were<00:01:20.150> rated<00:01:20.450> for<00:01:20.600> 1200<00:01:21.080> hits<00:01:21.230> I<00:01:21.470> think<00:01:21.830> that's

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
were rated for 1200 hits I think that's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.230 
were rated for 1200 hits I think that's
what<00:01:22.070> they're<00:01:22.220> afraid<00:01:22.310> for<00:01:22.550> its<00:01:22.970> sound<00:01:23.120> like

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
what they're afraid for its sound like

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.430 
what they're afraid for its sound like
that<00:01:23.390> well<00:01:23.750> I'm<00:01:23.960> about<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.170> test<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.680> yeah<00:01:26.440> its

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
that well I'm about to test it yeah its

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.260 
that well I'm about to test it yeah its
perks<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.950> does<00:01:28.100> look<00:01:28.280> pretty<00:01:28.310> cool<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.030> like

lot of pens have a lot of really
restricted<00:01:38.690> draw<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:39.080> they<00:01:39.170> hit<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.380> really

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
restricted draw if they hit it really

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.820

hard

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
hard

as<00:01:39.950> far<00:01:40.160> as<00:01:40.190> I<00:01:40.400> can<00:01:40.610> pinch<00:01:40.760> go<00:01:40.910> but<00:01:41.480> on<00:01:41.750> that

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
as far as I can pinch go but on that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.680 
as far as I can pinch go but on that
note<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.950> do<00:01:43.100> hit<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.340> for<00:01:43.640> about<00:01:43.760> five<00:01:44.300> six

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
note you do hit it for about five six

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.950 
note you do hit it for about five six
seconds<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.710> light<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.700> has<00:01:47.690> like<00:01:47.870> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
seconds the light it has like the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.650 
seconds the light it has like the
overheating<00:01:48.560> light<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.910> lot<00:01:50.180> do<00:01:50.420> when

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.820 
hit them about three times yeah you
could<00:02:02.420> hit<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.720> three<00:02:03.050> times<00:02:03.290> like<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.650> light

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
could hit it three times like the light

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.000 
could hit it three times like the light
out<00:02:04.010> before<00:02:04.400> we're<00:02:04.610> done<00:02:04.970> taking<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.480> hit<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:06.010> I

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
out before we're done taking a hit and I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.860 
out before we're done taking a hit and I
mean<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.400> kind<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.760> like

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:08.870 
mean it kind of like

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.590 
mean it kind of like
but<00:02:09.440> would<00:02:09.740> really<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.730> lengthens<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
but would really it lengthens the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.440 
but would really it lengthens the
lifetime<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.620> pen<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.580> can't<00:02:14.060> over

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
lifetime of the pen so you can't over

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.170 
lifetime of the pen so you can't over
hit<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:15.020> not<00:02:15.140> really<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:16.520> sucking

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
hit it you're not really like sucking

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.940 
hit it you're not really like sucking
all<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.540> its<00:02:17.660> power<00:02:17.900> out<00:02:18.140> yeah

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
all of its power out yeah

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.630 
all of its power out yeah
but<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.850> lot<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.570> pens<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.260> some<00:02:21.740> can't

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
but a lot of pens do that some can't

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
but a lot of pens do that some can't
really<00:02:22.940> take<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.480> much<00:02:23.750> pressure<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.260> can

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
really take that much pressure you can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.250 
really take that much pressure you can
hit<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.830> are<00:02:25.180> he's<00:02:26.180> right<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.960> make

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
hit on that are he's right it is to make

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.980 
hit on that are he's right it is to make
the<00:02:27.440> pen<00:02:27.620> actually<00:02:27.860> last<00:02:28.220> longer

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
the pen actually last longer

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.230 
the pen actually last longer
but<00:02:30.190> overall<00:02:31.190> though<00:02:31.670> these<00:02:31.820> are<00:02:31.940> pretty<00:02:32.090> good

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
but overall though these are pretty good

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.640
