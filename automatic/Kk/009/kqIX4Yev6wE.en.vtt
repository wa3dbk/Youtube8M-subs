there a willingness to pay maybe this is
not<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.750> easy<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.530> estimate<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.149> first

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
not so easy to estimate in in the first

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
not so easy to estimate in in the first
place<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:05.420> some<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.500> look<00:02:07.680> at

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
place but in some way if you look at

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.400 
place but in some way if you look at
what<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.610> lose<00:02:08.910> by<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.569> wearing<00:02:10.080> a

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
you can you can also do it in a slightly

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.920 
you can you can also do it in a slightly
different<00:04:12.110> way<00:04:12.530> as<00:04:12.950> Jeffrey<00:04:13.519> Timmons<00:04:13.940> says<00:04:14.660> in

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
different way as Jeffrey Timmons says in

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.020 
different way as Jeffrey Timmons says in
his<00:04:15.049> book<00:04:15.260> new<00:04:15.470> venture<00:04:15.829> creation<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:16.940> it

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
his book new venture creation so it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.440 
his book new venture creation so it
talks<00:04:17.269> about<00:04:17.590> supply<00:04:18.590> side<00:04:19.190> demand<00:04:19.850> side<00:04:20.209> and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450

talks about supply side demand side and
pricing<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.289> basically<00:04:22.099> this<00:04:22.430> is<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:23.270> three

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
pricing and basically this is the three

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.290 
pricing and basically this is the three
questions<00:04:24.110> we<00:04:24.349> had<00:04:24.590> before<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.760> there<00:04:26.060> an

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
questions we had before so is there an

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.990 
questions we had before so is there an
unsolved<00:04:26.990> problem<00:04:27.650> or<00:04:27.860> specific<00:04:28.490> customer

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
unsolved problem or specific customer

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.930 
unsolved problem or specific customer
need<00:04:29.210> are<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.870> able<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.139> identify<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.610> or

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
need are you able to identify that or

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.600 
need are you able to identify that or
are<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.180> unfocused<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:33.500> unfocused<00:04:34.009> is<00:04:34.400> with

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
are you unfocused and unfocused is with

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.779 
are you unfocused and unfocused is with
the<00:04:34.699> lowest<00:04:35.090> potential<00:04:35.479> identifying<00:04:36.550> need<00:04:37.550> or

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
the lowest potential identifying need or

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.309 
the lowest potential identifying need or
identified<00:04:38.270> problem<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.020> highest

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
identified problem is the highest

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.100 
identified problem is the highest
potential<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:40.190> there<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.060> demand<00:04:41.690> by<00:04:41.930> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
potential is there a demand by the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.950 
potential is there a demand by the
customer<00:04:42.949> so<00:04:43.310> can<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.669> reach<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.300> customer

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
customer so can you reach the customer

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.159

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
ideas either you're serving it or you

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.100 
ideas either you're serving it or you
might<00:05:42.560> be<00:05:42.889> able<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:43.460> create<00:05:43.880> a<00:05:44.000> need<00:05:44.360> if<00:05:44.900> you

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
might be able to create a need if you

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.129 
might be able to create a need if you
serve<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.469> need<00:05:45.889> you<00:05:46.610> answer<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.389> paying<00:05:47.840> off

hat damage they will definitely buy a
home<00:06:01.099> at<00:06:01.340> these<00:06:01.550> people

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:02.779

you<00:06:03.199> can<00:06:03.409> see<00:06:03.680> it<00:06:03.830> people<00:06:04.460> skiing<00:06:04.879> with

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
you can see it people skiing with

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.659 
you can see it people skiing with
helmets<00:06:05.690> too<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.289> that<00:06:07.099> was<00:06:07.310> just<00:06:07.580> a

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
helmets too and that was just a

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.080 
helmets too and that was just a
development<00:06:08.270> over<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.719> recent<00:06:08.930> years<00:06:10.090> online

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090

education<00:06:11.840> may<00:06:12.050> be<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.289> same<00:06:12.560> thing<00:06:12.919> people

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
education may be the same thing people

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.360 
education may be the same thing people
want<00:06:13.639> to<00:06:13.849> learn<00:06:14.150> but<00:06:15.050> they<00:06:15.830> are<00:06:15.919> not<00:06:16.069> able

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
want to learn but they are not able

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.519 
want to learn but they are not able
because<00:06:16.610> universities<00:06:17.000> are<00:06:17.629> so<00:06:17.840> far<00:06:18.139> away<00:06:18.289> are

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
because universities are so far away are

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.499 
because universities are so far away are
so<00:06:18.710> expensive<00:06:19.099> so<00:06:19.550> you<00:06:19.610> answer<00:06:20.270> to<00:06:20.479> a

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
so expensive so you answer to a

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.700 
so expensive so you answer to a
frustration<00:06:22.389> the<00:06:23.389> other<00:06:23.509> way<00:06:23.779> and<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.590> other

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
frustration the other way and the other

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.080 
frustration the other way and the other
origin<00:06:25.400> of<00:06:25.610> ideas<00:06:26.300> is<00:06:26.599> you<00:06:26.960> create<00:06:27.500> a<00:06:27.529> need

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
origin of ideas is you create a need

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.240 
origin of ideas is you create a need
people<00:06:29.090> don't<00:06:29.360> really<00:06:29.690> know<00:06:30.139> about<00:06:30.409> a<00:06:30.800> need

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
people don't really know about a need

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.969 
people don't really know about a need
they<00:06:32.090> know<00:06:32.330> don't<00:06:32.750> really<00:06:33.259> know<00:06:33.469> about<00:06:33.710> the

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
they know don't really know about the

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.959 
they know don't really know about the
gain<00:06:34.520> they<00:06:35.270> can<00:06:35.570> get<00:06:35.870> so<00:06:36.770> you<00:06:37.580> try<00:06:37.909> to

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 
gain they can get so you try to

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:39.970 
gain they can get so you try to
understand<00:06:38.750> what<00:06:38.990> discussed

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
understand what discussed

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.450 
understand what discussed
customers<00:06:40.490> truly<00:06:41.240> want<00:06:41.810> or<00:06:42.080> need<00:06:42.320> to<00:06:42.650> achieve

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
customers truly want or need to achieve

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.970 
customers truly want or need to achieve
and<00:06:44.390> maybe<00:06:44.570> online<00:06:44.780> education<00:06:45.530> is<00:06:45.620> also<00:06:45.830> an

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
and maybe online education is also an

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.030 
and maybe online education is also an
example<00:06:46.520> for<00:06:46.670> that<00:06:46.820> maybe<00:06:47.210> there's<00:06:47.480> people

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
example for that maybe there's people

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.480 
example for that maybe there's people
who<00:06:49.040> do<00:06:49.400> not<00:06:49.550> feel<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.180> need<00:06:50.450> for<00:06:50.810> education

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
who do not feel the need for education

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.770 
who do not feel the need for education
so<00:06:52.490> far<00:06:52.910> but<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.420> it's<00:06:53.630> reachable<00:06:54.560> more<00:06:55.250> easily

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
so far but if it's reachable more easily

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.660 
so far but if it's reachable more easily
maybe<00:06:56.980> they<00:06:57.980> also<00:06:58.250> educate<00:06:59.030> themselves

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
maybe they also educate themselves

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.970 
maybe they also educate themselves
honestly<00:07:01.670> most<00:07:02.330> of<00:07:02.600> the<00:07:02.780> ideas<00:07:02.980> entrepreneurs

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
honestly most of the ideas entrepreneurs

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.430 
honestly most of the ideas entrepreneurs

10 percent might be creating a need this
is<00:07:23.870> a<00:07:24.020> lot<00:07:24.410> more<00:07:24.920> difficult<00:07:25.160> because<00:07:25.820> you<00:07:26.090> have

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
is a lot more difficult because you have

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.160 
is a lot more difficult because you have
to<00:07:26.360> change<00:07:26.720> customers<00:07:27.470> behavior<00:07:27.920> you<00:07:28.670> have<00:07:28.700> to

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.170 
to change customers behavior you have to

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.950 
to change customers behavior you have to
have<00:07:30.170> the<00:07:30.560> vision<00:07:30.590> you<00:07:31.460> have<00:07:31.670> to<00:07:31.880> find<00:07:32.660> out

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
have the vision you have to find out

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.320 
have the vision you have to find out
what<00:07:33.230> the<00:07:33.350> customer<00:07:33.800> truly<00:07:34.310> wants<00:07:34.670> and<00:07:34.910> not

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
what the customer truly wants and not

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.940 
what the customer truly wants and not
every<00:07:35.660> entrepreneur<00:07:36.260> is<00:07:36.410> on<00:07:36.590> the<00:07:36.710> one<00:07:36.830> hand

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:36.950 
every entrepreneur is on the one hand

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.610 
every entrepreneur is on the one hand
able<00:07:37.400> to<00:07:37.580> do<00:07:37.760> that<00:07:37.970> and<00:07:38.300> on<00:07:39.050> the<00:07:39.080> other<00:07:39.260> hand

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
able to do that and on the other hand

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.180 
able to do that and on the other hand
not<00:07:40.420> every<00:07:41.420> customer<00:07:42.050> understands<00:07:42.650> that<00:07:42.920> so

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190 
not every customer understands that so

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.580 
not every customer understands that so
easily<00:07:43.460> that<00:07:43.880> you<00:07:44.090> can<00:07:44.270> stand<00:07:44.600> the<00:07:44.810> time<00:07:45.170> to

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.590 
easily that you can stand the time to

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.350 
easily that you can stand the time to
have<00:07:45.800> enough<00:07:46.130> customers<00:07:46.400> to<00:07:46.760> make<00:07:47.060> your

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
have enough customers to make your

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.730 
have enough customers to make your
company<00:07:47.990> profitable<00:07:49.180> so<00:07:50.180> this<00:07:50.420> is<00:07:50.630> a<00:07:50.660> way<00:07:51.020> to

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:51.740 
company profitable so this is a way to

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.940 
company profitable so this is a way to
differentiate<00:07:52.220> an<00:07:52.940> idea<00:07:53.600> from<00:07:54.050> a<00:07:54.230> good<00:07:54.410> idea

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.950 
differentiate an idea from a good idea

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.280 
differentiate an idea from a good idea
and<00:07:55.340> if<00:07:55.460> you<00:07:55.610> then<00:07:55.850> have<00:07:56.150> a<00:07:56.180> good<00:07:56.420> idea<00:07:56.630> it's

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.290 
and if you then have a good idea it's

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.380 
and if you then have a good idea it's
worth<00:07:57.820> rethinking<00:07:58.820> that<00:07:59.030> a<00:07:59.270> lot<00:07:59.840> more
