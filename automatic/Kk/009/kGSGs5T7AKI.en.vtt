00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.490 
use this tutorial mod and then you get
rid<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.310> say<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.660> says<00:02:21.900> new<00:02:22.110> items

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
rid of the say you it says new items

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.800 
rid of the say you it says new items
that<00:02:22.710> block<00:02:23.070> dot<00:02:23.490> but<00:02:24.210> if<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> don't<00:02:24.630> want<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that block dot but if you don't want to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
that block dot but if you don't want to
use<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> block<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.670> what<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:26.940> going

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
use a block and this is what it's going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.800 
use a block and this is what it's going
to<00:02:27.120> come<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.420> wanted<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> come<00:02:30.690> out

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
to come out as so I wanted to come out

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.260 
to come out as so I wanted to come out
of<00:02:30.930> chain<00:02:31.290> boots<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.130> change<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> item

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
of chain boots so I change it to item

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.270 
of chain boots so I change it to item
because<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.930> an<00:02:33.990> item<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> place

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
because it's an item and not a place

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.150 
because it's an item and not a place
will<00:02:35.580> block<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:37.110> item<00:02:37.800> dot<00:02:38.630> boot<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:40.710> do<00:02:40.860> do

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
will block so item dot boot you do do

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.960 
will block so item dot boot you do do
get<00:02:41.730> back<00:02:41.910> okay<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.510> need<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.870> do<00:02:43.170> dot<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
get back okay you need to do dot and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.060 
get back okay you need to do dot and
then<00:02:44.970> leave<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.570> for<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> little<00:02:45.960> bit<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.320> then

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
then leave it for a little bit and then

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.030 
then leave it for a little bit and then
it<00:02:47.880> will<00:02:48.060> come<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.320> want<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
it will come up on what you want for it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.700 
it will come up on what you want for it
will<00:02:50.340> come<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> items<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.650> then

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
will come up with all the items and then

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.330 
will come up with all the items and then
if<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> can't<00:02:53.220> find<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:54.380> try<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.710> write<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
if you can't find it try and write the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.400 
if you can't find it try and write the
couple<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.060> couple<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> first<00:02:57.990> letters

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
couple for a couple of the first letters

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.920 
couple for a couple of the first letters
of<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.850> will<00:02:59.940> probably<00:03:00.210> come<00:03:00.510> up<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
of it and it will probably come up so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.690 
of it and it will probably come up so
that<00:03:01.110> boot<00:03:01.320> chain<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:03.410> say<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> only<00:03:04.890> want<00:03:05.010> for

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
that boot chain and say I only want for

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.070 
that boot chain and say I only want for
one<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.480> these<00:03:10.460> and<00:03:11.460> then<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.870> what<00:03:12.960> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
one of these and then this is what it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.820 
one of these and then this is what it
says<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.470> then<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.260> role<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.530> still

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
says and then this is the role is still

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.240 
says and then this is the role is still
not<00:03:16.980> hard<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.989> what<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.230> need<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.500> do<00:03:19.650> so

not hard this is what you need to do so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.560 
not hard this is what you need to do so
X<00:03:21.050> which<00:03:22.050> says<00:03:22.350> here<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.770> says<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:23.570> character

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
X which says here it says a character

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.360 
X which says here it says a character
value<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.959> x<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.540> right<00:03:27.890> I'm<00:03:28.890> getting<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.220> bit

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
value of x and right I'm getting a bit

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.790 
value of x and right I'm getting a bit
mixed<00:03:29.550> up<00:03:29.700> here<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.180> well<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.770> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
next and next to the Inga iron and then

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.450 
next and next to the Inga iron and then
paste<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.480> but<00:04:37.260> make<00:04:37.740> sure<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:38.040> still<00:04:38.190> on<00:04:38.340> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
same line then you change the character

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.370 
same line then you change the character
value<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.850> say<00:04:42.240> well<00:04:42.480> i'm<00:04:42.900> just<00:04:43.170> going<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.320> use

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
finger i do it after every single time I

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.550 
finger i do it after every single time I
finished<00:05:45.390> doing<00:05:45.890> doing<00:05:46.890> it<00:05:47.040> so<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:48.080> can<00:05:49.080> see

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
finished doing doing it so I can see

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.780 
finished doing doing it so I can see
like<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:50.160> crafts<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.840> so<00:05:51.840> when<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.260> loads<00:05:52.530> up

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
like and crafts it so when this loads up

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.060 
like and crafts it so when this loads up
since<00:05:53.790> I'm<00:05:53.970> not<00:05:54.090> using<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.710> i'm<00:05:55.710> not<00:05:55.920> using

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
since I'm not using a i'm not using

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.710 
since I'm not using a i'm not using
fraps<00:05:56.460> oh<00:05:56.760> it<00:05:56.820> might<00:05:56.940> go<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.150> little<00:05:57.210> bit<00:05:57.480> slower

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720
