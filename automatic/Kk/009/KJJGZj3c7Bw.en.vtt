feet<00:01:39.600> per<00:01:39.840> second<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:41.009> pretty<00:01:41.189> consistent

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
feet per second it's pretty consistent

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
feet per second it's pretty consistent
I've<00:01:42.720> taken<00:01:42.990> quite<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.409> few<00:01:43.649> shots<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.579> the

I've taken quite a few shots and got the
same<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.299> pretty<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.630> every<00:01:46.049> time<00:01:46.340> so

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
same thing pretty much every time so

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.960 
same thing pretty much every time so
it's<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.799> actually<00:01:49.979> shoots<00:01:50.430> pretty<00:01:50.670> well

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it's a it actually shoots pretty well

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.649 
for a stock nut this is the cocking
handle<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> side<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:59.490> have<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.360> few

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
handle on the side and I have a few

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.330 
handle on the side and I have a few
other<00:02:00.710> darts<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> could<00:02:02.189> fire<00:02:03.049> but<00:02:04.049> uh<00:02:04.340> how

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
other darts here I could fire but uh how

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.910 
other darts here I could fire but uh how
surprised<00:02:05.820> Eve<00:02:07.580> must<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.700> made<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.920> minor

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
surprised Eve must have made some minor

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.510 
surprised Eve must have made some minor
changes<00:02:11.520> internally<00:02:12.209> because<00:02:12.690> uh

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
changes internally because uh

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.220 
changes internally because uh
I<00:02:14.200> do<00:02:15.200> believe<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.190> shooting<00:02:17.230> better

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
I do believe it to be shooting better

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.980 
I do believe it to be shooting better
than<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.360> original<00:02:21.550> blaster<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:23.360> really

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
than the original blaster but really

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.240 
than the original blaster but really
