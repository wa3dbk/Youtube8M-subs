00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
this is the frost death knight this is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.999 
this is the frost death knight this is
the<00:01:58.710> survival<00:01:59.579> hunter<00:02:00.090> spear<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.799> made<00:02:01.979> a

the survival hunter spear I just made a
video<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.820> talking<00:02:03.329> about<00:02:03.570> melee

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
video about this talking about melee

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.550 
video about this talking about melee
Hunter<00:02:04.500> possibly<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> isn't<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.479> bow

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

maybe<00:02:09.050> marksman<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.259> beast<00:02:10.530> mastery<00:02:11.129> will<00:02:11.400> be

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
maybe marksman and beast mastery will be

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.730 
maybe marksman and beast mastery will be
the<00:02:11.940> two<00:02:12.209> range<00:02:12.599> classes<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.440> maybe

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the two range classes and maybe

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.250 
the two range classes and maybe
survival<00:02:14.400> will<00:02:14.580> be<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> melee<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.600> maybe

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
survival will be a melee or maybe

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260 
survival will be a melee or maybe
they'll<00:02:16.590> throw<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.190> spear<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.060> maybe

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
they'll throw the spear and then maybe

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.140 
they'll throw the spear and then maybe
do<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.780> melee<00:02:19.050> combat<00:02:19.470> kind<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.550> interesting
