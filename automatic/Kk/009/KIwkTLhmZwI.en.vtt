00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.490
 I greet all the HD players 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.099
 engines we are still here at the stand 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.129
 ducati you see that here around us turns 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.780
 the 1199 super light 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.760
 unfortunately we cannot get closer 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.140
 of so now we will assume some for 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.880
 let you see it 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.620
 we have just passed the version 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.810
 blanket we see the discovered version 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.790
 first the features 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.310
 first of all he said something is 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.320
 for sale in america so don't dream 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.490
 c too too much drool over tc 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.800
 considering the materials that this is 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.900
 1199 super light tungsten mount for 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.630
 lighten the ergal crankshaft 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.430
 we have the titanium titanium exhaust 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.820
 that between politics and see here in 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.400
 bass mounted on this model 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.860
 ohlins suspension for the fork 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.980
 front for the rear one 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.780
 the solution is somewhat peculiar to 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.420
 aesthetic level maybe not at all 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.550
 like it but you have to keep this 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.900
 however a bike with over 200 horses 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.330
 165 kg this we have this 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.440
 balance we know if full or 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.870
 dry 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.909
 however now that the stand of 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.060
 you will see it you will see the weight 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.510
 on the indicated scale the 165 kg 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.250
 we have a design that surely 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.280
 traditional and characteristic of this 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.440
 to this super-light 1199 ducati 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.240
 we immediately see the carbon parts now 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.770
 that we have moved to the indoor version 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.909
 in plain sight carbon parts that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.369
 help to lighten the weight of 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.390
 this super light name e 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.010
 in fact maybe just put a little 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.980
 aesthetically not at the top especially 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.100
 on the part under all 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.900
 at the tail under the single-seater seat 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.940
 obviously because on this bike you don't 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.400
 we can expect to bring anything 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.750
 zavorrina for the rest on the part 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.300
 lower we see for example le 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.170
 eyelids under the eyes we see the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.000
 fender a very wide use of carbon 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 prestigious solutions such as 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 the headlights we see the led lights 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.110
 on the front and above all so much 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.820
 electronics on board because we talk about 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.240
 traction controls control for the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.940
 Braking abs of disk series have a 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.340
 brembo braking system that he managed 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.620
 obviously from bs 4-piston calipers 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.290
 and so on, so it really is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.330
 of a phenomenal model a price 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.330
 likewise phenomenal is not a motorcycle for 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.340
 everyone is a bike that will come out in 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.960
 united soon if you want it 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.120
 go and get it there with that is all 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.540
 Greetings to all HDblog EVA readers
