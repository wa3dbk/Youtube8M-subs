video before about how the cpu can't run
the<00:00:17.150> option<00:00:17.300> properly<00:00:18.490> most<00:00:19.490> of<00:00:19.670> time<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:21.500> yet

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
the option properly most of time and yet

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.269 
the option properly most of time and yet
there<00:00:23.000> are<00:00:23.150> times<00:00:23.480> when<00:00:23.750> they<00:00:23.869> can<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.860> that's

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
there are times when they can and that's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.010 
there are times when they can and that's
probably<00:00:25.520> makes<00:00:25.880> me<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.119> maddest<00:00:26.330> is<00:00:26.720> that

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
probably makes me the maddest is that

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.590 
probably makes me the maddest is that
there's<00:00:27.350> glimpses<00:00:28.010> of<00:00:28.250> these<00:00:28.550> things<00:00:28.730> turn

this option play but let me get right
here<00:01:07.880> he<00:01:07.909> already<00:01:08.509> starts<00:01:08.960> out<00:01:09.110> gets<00:01:09.920> up

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
here he already starts out gets up

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.999 
here he already starts out gets up
beside<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.360> gets<00:01:11.570> outside<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.899> line<00:01:12.200> cuts<00:01:12.830> off

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
beside it gets outside the line cuts off

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.460 
beside it gets outside the line cuts off
this<00:01:13.940> were<00:01:14.180> you'll<00:01:14.450> see<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.720> lot<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.049> problems

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
this were you'll see a lot of problems

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.070 
this were you'll see a lot of problems
happen<00:01:15.890> with<00:01:16.490> option<00:01:16.940> plays<00:01:17.210> instead<00:01:18.050> of

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
happen with option plays instead of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.240 
happen with option plays instead of
cutting<00:01:18.380> up<00:01:19.210> right<00:01:20.210> here<00:01:20.950> they'll<00:01:21.950> just<00:01:22.100> keep

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
cutting up right here they'll just keep

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.010 
cutting up right here they'll just keep
running<00:01:22.490> straight<00:01:23.000> sideways<00:01:23.300> or<00:01:23.630> even<00:01:23.810> cut

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
running straight sideways or even cut

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.559 
running straight sideways or even cut
backwards<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:25.190> some<00:01:25.429> odd<00:01:25.640> reason<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:26.270> doesn't

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
backwards for some odd reason it doesn't

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.300 
backwards for some odd reason it doesn't
make<00:01:26.780> any<00:01:26.990> sense<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.350> me<00:01:27.470> once<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.280> he

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
make any sense to me once that he

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
make any sense to me once that he
actually<00:01:28.520> follows<00:01:29.060> us<00:01:29.179> fullback<00:01:29.659> cuts<00:01:30.409> off<00:01:30.649> I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
actually follows us fullback cuts off I

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.059 
actually follows us fullback cuts off I
don't<00:01:32.330> want<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.539> get<00:01:32.690> what<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.590> tight<00:01:33.860> end

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
don't want to get what the tight end

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.919 
don't want to get what the tight end
players<00:01:34.310> doing<00:01:34.640> yeah<00:01:35.030> probably<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.600> think<00:01:35.810> it's

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
players doing yeah probably I think it's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.889 
players doing yeah probably I think it's
like<00:01:36.049> trying<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.380> block<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:37.490> guy<00:01:37.759> we<00:01:38.569> should

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
like trying to block this guy we should

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.980 
like trying to block this guy we should
have<00:01:38.990> been<00:01:39.080> cutting<00:01:39.289> up<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.770> don't<00:01:39.950> know<00:01:40.100> but

typically<00:02:07.980> you'll<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> nine

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
typically you'll see this is like a nine

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.220 
typically you'll see this is like a nine
yard<00:02:09.990> loss<00:02:10.289> or<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:10.680> crap<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.690> or<00:02:12.690> even

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
yard loss or some crap like that or even

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.400 
yard loss or some crap like that or even
though<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:14.750> they're<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.870> running<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.290> is

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
all way back over there they'll try the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.090 
all way back over there they'll try the
pitch<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.630> make<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> horrible<00:02:19.590> fail<00:02:19.860> of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.180 
pitch and like make a horrible fail of
it<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> huge<00:02:21.120> loss<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.140> fly<00:02:22.380> when

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it we have a huge loss on the fly when

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.610 
it we have a huge loss on the fly when
it<00:02:23.280> could<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.520> been<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> big<00:02:23.910> gain<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:25.470> this

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it could have been a big gain but this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.950 
it could have been a big gain but this
actually<00:02:25.830> came<00:02:26.100> out<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:27.210> really<00:02:27.720> good

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
actually came out as a really good

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.270 
actually came out as a really good
option<00:02:28.230> play<00:02:30.440> because<00:02:31.440> he<00:02:31.710> instead<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
option play because he instead of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.430 
option play because he instead of
cutting<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.700> sideways<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:33.720> cut<00:02:34.230> up

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
cutting it sideways you actually cut up

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.199 
cutting it sideways you actually cut up
and<00:02:35.630> showed<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:37.100> actual<00:02:38.209> intelligence

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
and showed you know actual intelligence

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.500 
and showed you know actual intelligence
on<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.170> run<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.370> option<00:02:41.850> he

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
on this run and on this option he

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
on this run and on this option he
couldn't<00:02:42.780> pitch<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.110> back<00:02:43.290> he<00:02:43.560> shouldn't

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
couldn't pitch it back he shouldn't

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.790 
couldn't pitch it back he shouldn't
pitch<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.190> back<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.670> play<00:02:45.350> by<00:02:46.350> any<00:02:46.530> means

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
pitch it back on this play by any means

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.280 
pitch it back on this play by any means
and<00:02:47.010> he<00:02:47.220> made<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.430> right<00:02:47.670> decision<00:02:48.230> kept<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and he made the right decision kept the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.440 
and he made the right decision kept the
ball<00:02:49.500> run<00:02:50.070> forward<00:02:50.610> tried<00:02:50.880> powering<00:02:51.270> ahead

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
ball run forward tried powering ahead

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.800 
ball run forward tried powering ahead
for<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> bit<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.880> was<00:02:54.000> great<00:02:54.209> blocking<00:02:54.510> he

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
for a bit there was great blocking he

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.870 
for a bit there was great blocking he
followed<00:02:55.230> his<00:02:55.410> blockers<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.280> once<00:02:56.520> which<00:02:56.700> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
followed his blockers for once which is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640 
followed his blockers for once which is
something<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.450> rare<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.410> this

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
something really rare to see in this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.750 
something really rare to see in this
game<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.070> running<00:02:59.430> backs<00:02:59.670> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.360> cpu<00:03:00.900> team

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
game with running backs on the cpu team

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
game with running backs on the cpu team
I'm<00:03:02.760> very<00:03:03.330> pleased<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.050> play<00:03:04.380> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
I'm very pleased with this play I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
I'm very pleased with this play I
thought<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.280> came<00:03:05.520> out<00:03:05.640> great<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.209> once

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
thought this came out great but once

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.110 
thought this came out great but once
again<00:03:06.540> I'm<00:03:06.989> really<00:03:07.560> mad<00:03:07.770> because<00:03:08.130> there's<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
again I'm really mad because there's so

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.320 
again I'm really mad because there's so
many<00:03:09.600> auction<00:03:10.320> plays<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:11.280> it's<00:03:11.519> some<00:03:12.150> stupid

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
many auction plays or it's some stupid

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.289 
many auction plays or it's some stupid
like<00:03:12.900> sideways<00:03:13.709> run<00:03:14.070> or<00:03:14.310> backwards<00:03:14.910> or<00:03:15.180> they

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
like sideways run or backwards or they

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.060 
like sideways run or backwards or they
end<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.570> being<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.810> huge<00:03:15.840> loss<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:16.680> something

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
end up being a huge loss or something

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.340 
end up being a huge loss or something
stupid<00:03:17.340> when<00:03:18.120> they<00:03:18.330> could<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.870> cut<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.200> up

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
stupid when they could just cut it up

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.320 
stupid when they could just cut it up
all<00:03:19.650> their<00:03:19.860> blockers<00:03:20.310> or<00:03:20.340> holes<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.299> for

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
all their blockers or holes it there for

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.150 
all their blockers or holes it there for
them<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.810> run<00:03:22.019> through<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.920> just<00:03:23.010> never

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
them to run through and they just never

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.759 
them to run through and they just never
run<00:03:23.430> through<00:03:23.730> them<00:03:23.850> instead<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:25.320> know<00:03:25.440> when

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
run through them instead you know when

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.130 
run through them instead you know when
once<00:03:26.070> again<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.610> little<00:03:27.090> glimpses<00:03:27.140> here

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
once again we get little glimpses here

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.370 
once again we get little glimpses here
and<00:03:28.290> there<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:30.080> quarterback<00:03:31.080> actually

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
and there of a quarterback actually

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.350 
and there of a quarterback actually
following<00:03:31.650> his<00:03:31.769> blocker<00:03:32.070> on<00:03:32.430> these<00:03:32.820> options

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
following his blocker on these options

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.920 
following his blocker on these options
or<00:03:34.340> glimpses<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.459> great<00:03:35.670> blocking<00:03:35.970> or<00:03:36.630> there's

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
or glimpses of great blocking or there's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.860 
or glimpses of great blocking or there's
glimpses<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.620> great<00:03:37.890> coverage

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
glimpses of great coverage

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.830 
glimpses of great coverage
we<00:03:39.379> get<00:03:39.500> glimpses<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:40.010> greatness<00:03:40.599> but<00:03:41.599> we<00:03:41.720> just

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
we get glimpses of greatness but we just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.100 
we get glimpses of greatness but we just
can't<00:03:42.080> have<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.590> consistently<00:03:43.870> Kaiser<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
can't have it consistently Kaiser the
