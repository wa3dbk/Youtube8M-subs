00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.890
 I will tell you the news 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:13.880
 In Japan, August 1 is the day of hunting ban and the number of buyers is increasing one after another. 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:18.320
 A game like this was announced in China next door 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.470
 Let's listen, so the relay is connected Hunter in the virtual world 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.470
 Mr. 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.929
 Yes you are a hunter here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.220
 A game hunter closely resembling a monster hunter series that made a big hit in Japan 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:34.890
 It is a game screen of the blade 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.890
 It is really made faithful to the original here 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.510
 Does this would be of be aware that tri-called city of waterside It is the state of the city 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.870
 I received a quest here and my husband still has something like a list of stars 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:57.190
 I can not see it for a while 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.190
 As far as I saw it, I could also see monsters of quite a certain form 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.350
 It's like a quest here in Snowy Mountain 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 I am a bra child and I can see Blango and Dodo Brango now 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:18.560
 Motion in the direction Furthermore, all the reality, such as the intense heat when it was made to move 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.960
 I do not do it is made faithful to the monster hunter series genuine 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.510
 Take damage 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.130
 It seems that you have cleared the quest now 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.130
 It did not look a little reward 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.070
 Location has changed Is it here jungle swamp 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 Oh is to do just the This would be lords Zazami in from the show 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.840
 Does not look only to the God also take anywhere 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.860
 It's right here. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.130
 Probably that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 I think I'm wearing a dragon skull, but I can see it too 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.440
 Here is reproduced well 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 Motion when spreading widely and attacking 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.960
 It is also exactly the same here water spitting of motion 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.950
 Kedomo I think this we also still attribute of that weakness that are offensive in this 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 is not it 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.480
 Aren't you making together a 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.400
 Here 's a motion article cut in case of a touch need 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.410
 Also all around here 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:30.420
 It looks a lot like you 've defeated your reservation right now 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.050
 Other than this, only monsters that I saw somewhere appear in the hunter blade 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.600
 Doing 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.600
 Yes From the above site opposite we tell 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.690
 Yes, thank you 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:52.030
 Not only monsters but also the movement of the hunter itself is just like the main house and surprised 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.900
 It should be noted that things like speak Chinese or to escape the monster in the information from the Pokke village 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.350
 Absent 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.800
 It was that it had nothing to do with the monster here 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.370
 To Soncho 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.310
 After this, you will be provided with the provision and the police will investigate whether there is any incident 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.530
 It is a policy to advance 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:17.180
 In addition, after querying the monster hunter release source Capcom 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.020
 The answer is that this is a completely unrelated game which does not mean that we have obtained our license 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.540
 Returned 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.740
 As there is no specific thing in the car including the talk that we do not do legal correspondence now 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.940
 I can not comment yet 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:35.540
 Because it becomes a problem of ir and home-like field not backward 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.959
 It was said that the appropriate divisions to deal with would correspond 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.939
 This announcement as if it was tailored before the release of the big title 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.659
 China's children are not worried about making the wrong 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.659
 We told
