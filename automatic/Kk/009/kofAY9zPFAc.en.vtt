so<00:00:00.630> riding<00:00:01.020> trails<00:00:01.290> blind<00:00:01.680> could<00:00:02.100> not<00:00:02.280> only<00:00:02.429> be

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so riding trails blind could not only be

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.240 
so riding trails blind could not only be
risky<00:00:03.149> but<00:00:04.110> also<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.589> can<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:04.799> really

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
risky but also it can be really

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.010 
risky but also it can be really
rewarding<00:00:05.600> relying<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.690> your<00:00:06.839> natural

the trail this is something that will

the trail this is something that will

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.200 

we're<00:00:36.740> in<00:00:36.830> a<00:00:36.890> bike<00:00:37.070> park<00:00:37.370> trail<00:00:37.640> with<00:00:37.820> loads<00:00:38.060> of

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
we're in a bike park trail with loads of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.540 
we're in a bike park trail with loads of
jobs<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.230> thing<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:39.530> with<00:00:39.980> bike<00:00:40.220> parks

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
jobs so the thing is with bike parks

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.220 
jobs so the thing is with bike parks
it's<00:00:40.700> probably<00:00:41.000> quite<00:00:41.150> easy<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.570> do<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.810> couple

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
it's probably quite easy to do a couple

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.680 
it's probably quite easy to do a couple
of<00:00:42.290> runs<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.830> one<00:00:43.040> trail<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:44.000> would

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
of runs of that one trail so I would

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.390 
of runs of that one trail so I would
definitely<00:00:45.080> recommend<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.770> rather<00:00:46.130> than

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
definitely recommend that rather than

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.700 
definitely recommend that rather than
just<00:00:46.580> sending<00:00:46.760> off<00:00:47.000> every<00:00:47.360> jump<00:00:47.630> this<00:00:48.380> trails

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
just sending off every jump this trails

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.680 
just sending off every jump this trails
probably<00:00:49.160> got<00:00:49.250> 60<00:00:49.730> jumps<00:00:50.060> on<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.510> try<00:00:50.660> and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
probably got 60 jumps on it and try and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.150 
probably got 60 jumps on it and try and
remember<00:00:50.900> which<00:00:51.350> one<00:00:51.590> is<00:00:51.739> which<00:00:51.920> is

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
remember which one is which is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.979 
remember which one is which is
definitely<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.610> whole<00:00:52.760> thing<00:00:53.060> and<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:53.870> just

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
definitely a whole thing and you just

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.960 
definitely a whole thing and you just
don't<00:00:54.260> know<00:00:54.410> how<00:00:54.680> long<00:00:54.950> that<00:00:54.980> jump<00:00:55.489> is<00:00:55.640> or<00:00:55.850> how

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
don't know how long that jump is or how

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.400 
don't know how long that jump is or how
big<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.390> is<00:00:56.450> or<00:00:56.660> if<00:00:56.780> it's<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:57.020> double<00:00:57.200> or

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
big it is or if it's a double or

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.320 
big it is or if it's a double or
whatever<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:58.489> jump<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.880> completely

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
whatever so this jump is completely

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.500 
whatever so this jump is completely
blind<00:00:59.540> until<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.710> get<00:01:00.950> to<00:01:01.100> here<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.000> now<00:01:02.210> I<00:01:02.239> can

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
blind until I get to here and now I can

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.840 
blind until I get to here and now I can
see<00:01:02.660> it's<00:01:02.809> slightly<00:01:03.050> hipped<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:04.670> not

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
see it's slightly hipped and it's not

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.219 
see it's slightly hipped and it's not
very<00:01:05.120> long<00:01:05.330> considering<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.870> speed<00:01:05.990> I'm

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
very long considering the speed I'm

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.469 
very long considering the speed I'm
coming<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.650> with<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.160> it'd<00:01:07.670> be<00:01:07.729> very<00:01:07.850> easy<00:01:08.210> to

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
coming in with so it'd be very easy to

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.359 
coming in with so it'd be very easy to
overshoot<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.200> or<00:01:09.410> send<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.770> into<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.040> Bank

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
overshoot this or send it into that Bank

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.820 
overshoot this or send it into that Bank
maybe<00:01:11.330> stop<00:01:11.690> at<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.900> top<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.229> trail<00:01:12.440> watch

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
maybe stop at the top of trail watch

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.920 
maybe stop at the top of trail watch
some<00:01:13.009> people<00:01:13.250> write<00:01:13.460> down<00:01:13.759> or<00:01:14.119> just<00:01:14.450> do<00:01:14.600> one

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
some people write down or just do one

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.570 
some people write down or just do one
slow<00:01:15.229> run<00:01:15.470> first<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.979> get<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.250> feel<00:01:16.400> for<00:01:16.460> the

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
slow run first to get a feel for the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.210 
slow run first to get a feel for the
jobs<00:01:16.820> before<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.300> try<00:01:17.479> sending<00:01:17.690> them<00:01:18.160> so<00:01:19.160> you

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
jobs before we try sending them so you

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.660 
jobs before we try sending them so you
can<00:01:19.369> see<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.700> tight<00:01:20.000> turn<00:01:20.330> behind<00:01:20.900> me

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
can see this tight turn behind me

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.609 
can see this tight turn behind me
there's<00:01:22.670> definitively<00:01:23.240> two<00:01:23.570> lines<00:01:23.869> low<00:01:24.440> and

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
there's definitively two lines low and

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.070 
there's definitively two lines low and
high<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.610> high<00:01:25.850> line<00:01:26.060> usually<00:01:26.479> will<00:01:26.630> open<00:01:26.990> up

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
high the high line usually will open up

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.840 
high the high line usually will open up
the<00:01:27.200> corner<00:01:27.500> for<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.430> allow<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.670> to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
the corner for you and allow you to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.609 
the corner for you and allow you to
carry<00:01:29.180> more<00:01:29.420> momentum<00:01:29.690> through<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.350> turn

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
carry more momentum through that turn

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.740 
carry more momentum through that turn
this<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.280> good<00:01:31.490> practice<00:01:31.520> when<00:01:32.119> riding<00:01:32.360> trails

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
this is good practice when riding trails

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.950 
this is good practice when riding trails
blind<00:01:36.910> so<00:01:37.910> it's<00:01:38.030> approaching<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.600> tighter

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
blind so it's approaching on the tighter

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.290 
blind so it's approaching on the tighter
line<00:01:39.350> as<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:40.190> can<00:01:40.340> see<00:01:40.520> has<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.790> slow<00:01:41.030> up<00:01:41.180> a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
line as you can see has to slow up a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.690 
line as you can see has to slow up a
little<00:01:41.510> bit<00:01:41.720> more<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.200> one<00:01:42.860> thing<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.100> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
little bit more and one thing that that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.340 
little bit more and one thing that that
he<00:01:43.760> does<00:01:43.970> lose<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.450> when<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.720> opens<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.200> the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
he does lose is when it opens up the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.230 
he does lose is when it opens up the
corner<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:46.040> can<00:01:46.070> see<00:01:46.460> further<00:01:46.820> down<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
corner you can see further down the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.649 
corner you can see further down the
trail

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
trail

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.899 
trail
therefore<00:01:48.020> prepare<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.100> next<00:01:49.280> two<00:01:49.640> turns

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
therefore prepare for the next two turns

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.570 
therefore prepare for the next two turns
so<00:01:50.840> overall<00:01:51.229> just<00:01:51.590> makes<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.250> little<00:01:52.370> bit

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
so overall just makes it a little bit

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.370 
so overall just makes it a little bit
more<00:01:52.729> difficult<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.420> doesn't<00:01:53.720> flow<00:01:53.930> quite<00:01:54.229> as

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
more difficult and doesn't flow quite as

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.370

well<00:01:55.210> following<00:01:56.210> another<00:01:56.540> rider<00:01:56.930> can

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
well following another rider can

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.010 
well following another rider can
sometimes<00:01:57.920> work<00:01:58.190> really<00:01:58.670> well<00:01:58.970> especially<00:01:59.540> if

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
sometimes work really well especially if

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.020 
sometimes work really well especially if
they<00:02:00.170> know<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> trail<00:02:00.860> make<00:02:01.520> sure<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.850> leave

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
they know the trail make sure you leave

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.120 
they know the trail make sure you leave
a<00:02:02.090> few<00:02:02.540> bike<00:02:02.780> lengths<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:03.710> can<00:02:03.890> read

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
a few bike lengths so that you can read

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
exposed piece of trail there's a big

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.960 
exposed piece of trail there's a big
drop<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:39.019> go<00:02:39.230> off<00:02:39.320> there<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:40.400> can<00:02:40.610> get<00:02:40.760> pretty

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
drop I go off there that can get pretty

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.990 
drop I go off there that can get pretty
serious<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:41.780> goes<00:02:42.590> back<00:02:42.859> to<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.160> one<00:02:43.430> skill<00:02:43.790> I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
serious so goes back to that one skill I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.610 
serious so goes back to that one skill I
talk<00:02:44.239> about<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> lot<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.870> our<00:02:44.959> skills<00:02:45.260> videos

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
talk about a lot in our skills videos

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.890 
talk about a lot in our skills videos
it's<00:02:45.889> looking<00:02:46.820> where<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.090> need<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.419> be<00:02:47.510> going

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
it's looking where you need to be going

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.170 
it's looking where you need to be going
in<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.439> not<00:02:48.709> where<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.189> don't<00:02:49.430> want<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.700> be<00:02:49.849> so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
in and not where you don't want to be so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.119 
in and not where you don't want to be so
try<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.049> keep<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.319> head<00:02:51.439> up<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.860> almost

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
try and keep the head up and almost

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.699 
try and keep the head up and almost
ignore<00:02:52.489> this<00:02:52.970> big<00:02:53.299> drop<00:02:53.629> to<00:02:53.840> your<00:02:53.900> left<00:02:54.200> okay

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.039 

so<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.849> approach<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.599> see<00:02:59.840> down<00:03:00.019> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
so on the approach I can see down the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.259 
so on the approach I can see down the
trail<00:03:00.439> there's<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.680> huge<00:03:01.069> rock<00:03:01.340> roll<00:03:01.610> it's

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
trail there's a huge rock roll it's

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.360 
trail there's a huge rock roll it's
completely<00:03:02.900> blind<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.010> don't<00:03:04.069> know

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
completely blind and I don't know

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.059 
completely blind and I don't know
whether<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:04.970> drop<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.480> or<00:03:06.140> ride<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.709> at

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
whether I have to drop it or ride it at

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.849 
whether I have to drop it or ride it at
that<00:03:07.310> pace<00:03:07.609> I<00:03:07.970> would<00:03:08.599> be<00:03:08.720> unable<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.049> drop<00:03:09.560> it

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
that pace I would be unable to drop it

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.890 
that pace I would be unable to drop it
I<00:03:09.890> would<00:03:10.129> advise<00:03:10.459> with<00:03:10.790> obstacles<00:03:11.569> like<00:03:11.720> this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
I would advise with obstacles like this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.890 
I would advise with obstacles like this
so<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.859> you<00:03:12.980> really<00:03:13.340> stop<00:03:14.060> have<00:03:14.599> a<00:03:14.629> look

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
so that you really stop have a look

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.179 
so that you really stop have a look
here's<00:03:15.530> another<00:03:15.650> one<00:03:16.069> it's<00:03:16.670> far<00:03:16.939> more<00:03:16.970> visible

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
here's another one it's far more visible

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.680 
here's another one it's far more visible
I'm<00:03:19.189> able<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.549> do<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.970> one<00:03:20.180> because<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.659> can

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
I'm able to do that one because I can

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.530 
I'm able to do that one because I can
see<00:03:21.049> my<00:03:21.230> landing<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.250> beyond<00:03:22.639> down<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.030> trail

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
see my landing and beyond down the trail

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.210 
see my landing and beyond down the trail
so<00:03:24.019> there's<00:03:24.200> writing<00:03:24.590> tracks<00:03:24.829> blind

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
so there's writing tracks blind

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
so there's writing tracks blind
something<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:25.819> I<00:03:25.909> really<00:03:26.389> enjoy<00:03:26.599> doing<00:03:27.019> and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
something that I really enjoy doing and
