00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello his worries today I want 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.280
 show you how to make a 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.680
 dueling makeup critics on a half 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.290
 of the face which is very appreciated especially 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.609
 little girls paint a bow in 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.499
 sky very quickly is not always 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.480
 obvious unless you have involved 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.769
 this one that I manufacture besides me 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 same and if you too want 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.519
 learn how to make one feel free to 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.739
 click on the link that appears as 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.079
 you see it I put my sponge well at 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.669
 dish and I fraud on the surface for 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.449
 transfer all the colors at the same 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.710
 time I then put the sponge to little 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.500
 near the middle of the front 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.350
 and I tap slightly while forming 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.600
 a circular arc on one half of the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.340
 face as you see it's 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.429
 really fast and easy to 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.289
 run before the colors do not dry 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.850
 completely I apply glitter 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.420
 golden in color thanks to a small 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.730
 soft plastic bottle that me 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.160
 allows to completely cover the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.640
 surface evenly without 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.530
 deteriorate the makeup below the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.150
 only small inconvenience, however, of these 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 small soft bottles is that the 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.570
 glitter tend to fly away a 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.820
 little anywhere and that's when 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.890
 that I use a powder brush have 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.409
 also called kabuki brush which 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.479
 looks like this to remove the 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.159
 glitter from the face that may have landed 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.380
 in places where I did not want to 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.060
 to have 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.560
 I then place my index finger in a 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.390
 wipe and I did a little bit of 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.840
 makeup at the end of the bow in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.159
 sky shaped concave 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.280
 I will explain in a moment 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.750
 why this step is important 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.240
 I now take a white color 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.149
 very opaque on a tongue brush 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.899
 medium sized cat and I form a 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.149
 pretty big oval that as you see 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.539
 perfectly fits in just 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.579
 below the round and the rainbow 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.750
 I decided to enlarge my we are worth 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.880
 a little more than I could not find 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.320
 really at these great my taste and I 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 take a sponge now 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.920
 completely dry that I tap on the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.259
 white as long as this one is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.849
 still slightly wet which allows 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.500
 to make disappear the traces of 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.489
 brush and get a good surface 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.380
 homogeneous always with the same a jump 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.209
 I add two small triangles well 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.390
 pointed on each side for the ears 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.830
 hello kitty to paint flowers 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.690
 in the typical lockheed style 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.730
 I use a round brush with bristles 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.680
 are slightly more bushy and the last 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.750
 more rounded than a round brush 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.610
 traditional I'm going first 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.140
 do a demonstration on my arm because 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.450
 after recording this video I 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.209
 realized that my hand was obstructing the field 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.010
 of vision after impregnating my 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.319
 brush of a lot of makeup well 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.200
 Thick game positions it at an angle 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.560
 perpendicular to the top of the surface 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.060
 and I press it flat on the skin and I 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.100
 then removes them quickly enough 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.080
 to make the first petal I continue 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.239
 to do this to make a flower to five 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.730
 petals while leaving small space 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.319
 empty in the center of the flower I use 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 so this technique to add three 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.090
 small flowers at the very top of the arch 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.690
 sky 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.340
 two yellow and one fuchsia pink are 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.720
 the typical colors to occultism and 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.660
 of course you can use other 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.130
 colors if you wish as long as 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.769
 I have the color or on my brush I 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.150
 am going to do the little knot I know he 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.920
 is normally on the other side of the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.989
 head of the water who you are but because of the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.079
 hair I'm going to do it on this side I 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.420
 so start with a pretty thick point j 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.329
 rounded triangle hang that I 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.819
 completely pink paints to add 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.160
 small leaves around the flowers I 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.870
 will use the double method 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.560
 loading i showed you in a video 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.019
 former 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.790
 I take two colors on my 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.670
 brush first of all light green then 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.230
 dark green exactly as for 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.389
 make the flower petals all over 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.489
 the time I hold my brush right 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.200
 above the skin and I press it to 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.750
 different places to add 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.600
 some leaves around the flowers 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.010
 now with a yellow color on a 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.380
 bread will know a little smaller 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.880
 at number 3 I add a point to his 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.980
 fangs for the hello kitty nose 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.109
 another point in the center of the flower 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.720
 pink and other slightly more points 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.180
 small as decoration around the flowers 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.760
 said 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.489
 and with the same rose that I used 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.819
 just now for the hello ribbon 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.039
 kitty 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.350
 I add two points to the center of 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.810
 yellow flowers for the next step 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.270
 I use a black color well 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.940
 pigmented and I recommend you 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.710
 to use a small brush in 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.350
 my case it's a bread will be size 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.020
 number 2 I first start with 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.190
 do two points for the eyes and I 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.889
 then attacks me in contours 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.199
 starting with hello kitty's knot 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.060
 I'm sorry my hand and so in front of 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.919
 do not see much but in fact I 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.169
 am simply the forms that I have 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.050
 MP before then continued 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.540
 by the outlines of the little ears and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.760
 of the oval of the face 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.170
 I must admit that this step is not 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.300
 always obvious had I myself 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.940
 still have some difficulty getting 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.010
 very fine and regular lines 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.800
 and especially who come together to good 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.420
 place like for example here maybe 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.520
 that you will do better than me 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.530
 in any case what I hope it takes 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.030
 just continue to train the 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.670
 more often than not and not 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.530
 discourage and of course do not forget 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.830
 no longer the three small traits 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.990
 hello kitty whiskers on each side 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.170
 I continue then perfect the outline 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.550
 of all the flowers and leaves 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.760
 to make the finest lines 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.860
 possible I try to use only 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.130
 the tip of my brush and never 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.660
 lay flat on the skin in a video 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.280
 previous I showed you how 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.860
 make the little stars sparkling 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.500
 that I add here to some places in 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.210
 up and down the rainbow as well 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.200
 only a few sets of small dots 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.410
 whites that adds a lot of finesse and 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.750
 lightness to all makeup 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.030
 there are other possible variations 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.250
 to this motif sometimes instead of flowers 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.500
 jma which is clouds or stars or 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.300
 hearts of all possible anyway 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.280
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.210
 thank you very much for following up I tell you 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.660
 now very soon 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.660
 goodbye 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.740
 we
