00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
top coat I get it at CVS and I think

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.949 
top coat I get it at CVS and I think
it's<00:02:56.280> about<00:02:56.489> six<00:02:56.819> dollars<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.450> I've<00:02:57.569> had<00:02:57.780> this

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
it's about six dollars but I've had this

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.309 
it's about six dollars but I've had this
bottle<00:02:58.349> for<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> long<00:02:58.950> time<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.810> at<00:03:00.870> least<00:03:00.930> six

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
bottle for a long time for at least six

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.199 
bottle for a long time for at least six
months<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:01.950> still<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.430> lots<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.819> product

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
months and I still have lots of product

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.449 
months and I still have lots of product
left<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.659> bottle

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.970 

so<00:03:08.030> basically<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.540> think<00:03:08.930> between<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.500> Revlon

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
so basically I think between the Revlon

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.069 
so basically I think between the Revlon
quick<00:03:10.250> dry<00:03:10.519> base<00:03:10.549> coat<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.980> out-the-door

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
quick dry base coat and the out-the-door

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.050 
quick dry base coat and the out-the-door
top<00:03:15.079> coat<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:16.159> those<00:03:16.370> are<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.760> things

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
top coat I think those are the things

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:30.490 
top coat I think those are the things
