00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 a thick handeloh the bastelbögen there 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.300
 outside 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 we are making a mini together today 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.349
 album and if you think now I know 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.450
 I do not already know you 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:22.230
 namely, made up and following 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.630
 we need for it and 21 12 x 12 paper 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 your choice and for which no appropriate 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.890
 board to hand 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.110
 a brilliant idea 29 pencil and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.669
 not to mention the scissors and then 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.460
 we can already start and twelve 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.309
 fold again on one side 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.309
 once at 4 and once at 80 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.339
 then we turn the whole thing once and 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.250
 do the same again so we do 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.250
 fold at 4 and once at 81 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.859
 it is not here, however 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.309
 because we still have two lines if we have to 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.670
 pull and twice is twice and though 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.590
 at 4 a quarter and once at 8 1 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.500
 pay attention this is this little blue one 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.420
 nipple nicely next to the 8 and then 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.430
 we turn the whole thing back in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.280
 the starting position so that this 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.380
 this wide column we folded there 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.390
 have quasi the top and then it goes 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.090
 continue, and we are now folding at 33 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.819
 quarter, however, only up to the first 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.200
 if line and the same we do 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.200
 also at 8 a quarter 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.600
 Now we have to do a bit of a joke 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.070
 and because I'm cutting from that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.479
 Twelve times twelve paper somehow like that 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.920
 I am awkward that I then the whole 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.020
 time this twelve times twelve paper like that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 throw from left or right because of me 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 do it all over here with it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.119
 we see we have to cut and that 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 let's cut those in the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.630
 end effect just out 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.390
 the whole thing should be like that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.369
 We look and then cut 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.729
 these lower two lines are easy 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.729
 only one 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.550
 Now we have to manage everything 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.959
 bend over to see if it too 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.800
 looks reasonable 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.990
 yes and I noticed that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.380
 we made a minimal mistake there 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.840
 is 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.270
 yes we would have the case board again 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.870
 rauskramen because we forgot one 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.319
 Falling can happen 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.910
 but done very fast and there because 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.790
 where I point this is 378 and from 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.420
 we pull this middle piece there 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.610
 once the palatinate at 378 from above to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.140
 completely down and do the same 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 We also on the right side and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.170
 though at 8 1 8 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.239
 there we have to get out again 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.209
 because we have to down there this little 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.430
 cut away fish otherwise fits 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.860
 our mini album is not together 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.030
 and as you can see we still have to 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.010
 snip a bit 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.920
 but then it has too 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.019
 with the scissors for this lower one 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.850
 square is a little taller than you 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.950
 See, that's why I just work it 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.600
 high and you like me that and cuts 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.600
 it then simply shorter in connection 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.290
 and when that's done we have to do that 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.319
 stick it all together once we do it 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.450
 From it a small bell pocket pocket 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.280
 Ace doubles no matter pocket 40 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.150
 good and indeed need the glue and 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.090
 We bring that on the left side 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.980
 on the edge of the little bit on and 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.099
 squeeze the whole neatly and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.920
 We clinics the upper right 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.209
 corner direction lower left corner and me 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.220
 always do it that way 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.230
 little bit of the other design paper 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.069
 is left over and we do the same 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.830
 also on the online 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.850
 opposite side and so works 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.579
 you put it all together 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.919
 As you can see , this is a mini album or 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.100
 What is the difference unicorn mini album 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.380
 or is it one is one and two one 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.910
 square shape i hope i breast myself 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.590
 not here with foreign feathers or 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.060
 how to say that but I have it myself 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.169
 really thought up myself so i have 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.300
 it has not been seen that way yet 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.500
 if there is already somewhere then it is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.500
 But that's what I have for myself 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.120
 now thought you could do the whole thing 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.370
 of course with a magnet 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.580
 close or so that's me 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.729
 now just expensive and that's why 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.160
 I take a rest of paper from 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.840
 strip rest paper press the once 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.820
 tidy when I order the mini 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.160
 album put and fix the whole with 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.200
 glue and that's how it looks 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.250
 yes and now really only missing 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.539
 one and that is the déco yes me that is 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.250
 now really optional 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.479
 you can let the Sun but what I 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.250
 also like to make it are so foto 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.440
 Butcheries stick so I'm measuring myself 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.600
 this single squares once out in 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.720
 in this case it is now 10 x 10 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.190
 cm so i cut my square in 9x 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.229
 9 because I want one from that 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.150
 oranges and looks a bit too 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:30.410
 then I do that for everyone 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:33.289
 Squares and music are just that 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.979
 my wish is mini-album for mine 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.900
 girlfriend 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.060
 this little butterfly that sits 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.500
 up there on it, it looks like as if 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.210
 just landed and then I have there 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.630
 a nice saying stamp of paper 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.540
 basics and there it is beautiful 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:50.320
 nice that you are there and that's how it looks 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.600
 whole then yes I have here despite 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.910
 thicker of kaiser creaks from this hand 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.320
 collection the paper is also taken 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.000
 from the same collection 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.270
 I found that somehow completely 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.400
 nice to match this orange then 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.800
 I also stamped and 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.030
 stamped and stamped and woman 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.740
 because they were allowed in 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.780
 combination with the typical somehow 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.730
 not missing and here I still have 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.320
 so little text tinkered so actually 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.790
 I did not tinker with it but 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 they were in some newspaper in it 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.610
 I only embellished it with paper 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.810
 then I have these down there 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.430
 little word down 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.020
 You know that in this twelve times 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.410
 There are twelve papers down there 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.310
 another piece of design from the 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.720
 other side 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.400
 yes I have in any case 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.380
 sort of cut and sort of 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.420
 have that because there is still on the text sticks 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.570
 I found it sweet and yes, too 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.560
 the butterflies find themselves again 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.880
 end in our three corners 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.410
 then I have such a couple 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.900
 stuck on and flowers and so border 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.430
 and yes, that's all I really am 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.830
 fittingly I found it 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.450
 glued as you can see we have there 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.850
 above yes this slightly wider column 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.650
 folded now makes that synonymous sense 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.450
 if we will pack in there in the daytime and in such a way 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.650
 the whole a bit thicker but not 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.240
 Too fat as you can see, because we were taken care of 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.280
 and that's how it looks 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.140
 Butterflies can fly and me 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.440
 Hope my girlfriend is happy about it 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.240
 and yes I wish you a lot of fun 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.040
 Im copying I would like something too 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.520
 of you or otherwise I would 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.300
 to care 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.300
 Until next time
