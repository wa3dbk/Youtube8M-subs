00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
yourself will change with time as you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.760 
yourself will change with time as you
work<00:02:46.820> out<00:02:47.060> maybe<00:02:47.300> you'll<00:02:47.540> become<00:02:47.690> sated<00:02:48.410> so

then<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.010> become<00:02:49.300> unmotivated<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.390> keep<00:02:50.690> up

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
then you become unmotivated to keep up

then you become unmotivated to keep up
the<00:02:51.110> lifestyle<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.890> fall<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
the lifestyle and you fall out of the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.270 
the lifestyle and you fall out of the
habit<00:02:52.940> you're<00:02:53.450> always<00:02:53.810> searching<00:02:54.290> outside<00:02:54.740> of

you<00:02:55.510> motivation<00:02:56.510> as<00:02:56.960> I've<00:02:57.140> said<00:02:57.350> before<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
you motivation as I've said before I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.700 
you motivation as I've said before I
think<00:02:57.980> always<00:02:58.550> comes<00:02:58.790> from<00:02:59.000> within<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.750> deeply

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
think always comes from within a deeply

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.250 
think always comes from within a deeply
ingrained<00:03:01.190> belief<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:02.000> yourself<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.720> reason

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
ingrained belief in yourself a reason

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.960 
ingrained belief in yourself a reason
why<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.460> that's<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.760> think

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
why you do it and that's what I think

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.720 
why you do it and that's what I think
the<00:03:05.300> fundamental<00:03:05.540> question<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.590> answer<00:03:06.920> when

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the fundamental question to answer when

you're trying to discover why or how to
get<00:03:10.640> motivated<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.360> why<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.290> why<00:03:12.620> do

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
get motivated is why you do this why do

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.980 
get motivated is why you do this why do
you<00:03:12.950> train<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.520> first<00:03:13.880> place<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.420> that's

you train in the first place and that's

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.510 
you train in the first place and that's
where<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.260> get<00:03:15.440> back<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:15.890> concept<00:03:16.430> of
