00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.719
 Now the chemist of Germany has subjected river water to a drug test 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.999
 in total, samples were taken from 15 watercourses 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.889
 should want to know what's at his goal 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.329
 It now went in our investigation 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.369
 also objective so with percent possible mixing exact measurements 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.760
 to prove how much cocaine is coming from the population after it was previously 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 has been taken in the rivers ultimately 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.830
 but how does cocaine ever get into the rivers? 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.940
 very easily 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.620
 Each of the art has subsequently felt the Briton's body 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.570
 These are then broken down and excreted in the urine and get over 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 the sewage treatment plants in the rivers 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.810
 in the laboratory, the samples are analyzed firmly in the river water becomes one 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.330
 Solvent added after five hours can be used to cocaine 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 Filter out residues 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.780
 it is of course an objective measurements here have the degradation product in the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.770
 human body 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.039
 Alain Delon percent + voss and can prove and percent that can 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.290
 he does not percent 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.350
 It can only come from somewhere 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.370
 but people consume and we could also prove God 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.470
 we'll see 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340
 8000 BSC is the compensation 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.580
 Dr a consumer at Rheine Dose Cocaine Iceland that will then be in the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190
 Wastewater treatment plant to be invested 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.250
 and that is a result that is not very well known in this form 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.850
 was 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.470
 The determined amounts of the cocaine decomposition product are in the study 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 then extrapolated 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.240
 In the end, Professor Sorge actually gets a value between 4 cocaine 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 The results of his investigation were consumed here 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.220
 Dusseldorf 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 The service study estimates that cocaine use is 30 kilos a day 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.969
 that would be eleven tonnes of pure cocaine a year 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.709
 Of course we have at the pure that he has a large catchment area between 20 and 40 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.530
 millions 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.130
 per inhabitant the last of their excretion products over the Rhine 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.180
 so that the cocaine and the degradation products released into the sea 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.809
 not rare 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.549
 here the examinations yield a value of 27 kilos a day 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.290
 that would be ten tons of cocaine a year
