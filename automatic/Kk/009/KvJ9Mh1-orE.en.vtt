then<00:02:11.510> start<00:02:11.870> breathing<00:02:12.580> try<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.640> keep<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
then start breathing try to keep the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.260 
then start breathing try to keep the
three<00:02:14.690> sections<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.530> even<00:02:16.040> as<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.730> can<00:02:17.030> as

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
three sections and even as you can as

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.660 
three sections and even as you can as
equal<00:02:17.810> as<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.890> way<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.190> don't<00:02:19.340> have

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
equal as you can that way you don't have

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.810 
equal as you can that way you don't have
that<00:02:19.880> need<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.360> borrow<00:02:20.780> from<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.220> other

that need to borrow from the other
sections<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.650> break<00:02:24.980> down

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
sections and then you just break down

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:38.310 
sections and then you just break down
and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:26.000> twist<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.780> twirl

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.480 

come<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.650> tools<00:02:39.980> out<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:41.440> twirl<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.920> shorten

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
come to tools out and twirl to shorten

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:55.240 
come to tools out and twirl to shorten
and<00:02:43.790> even<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.930> section<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.680> you're<00:02:55.040> good<00:02:55.220> to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
when I sleep I just tie them down with a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.830 
when I sleep I just tie them down with a
satin<00:03:14.840> map<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.880> I'm<00:03:16.880> ready<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.120> back<00:03:17.420> ready

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
satin map and I'm ready to back ready

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:30.190 
satin map and I'm ready to back ready
for<00:03:18.080> bed<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:29.360> following<00:03:29.690> morning<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.140> took

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
for bed the following morning I took

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.010 
for bed the following morning I took
down<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.920> satin<00:03:31.400> matte<00:03:31.580> use<00:03:32.180> some

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
down the satin matte use some

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.400 
down the satin matte use some
oil<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.709> moisturize<00:03:34.580> my<00:03:35.330> head<00:03:35.600> rather<00:03:36.110> to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
oil to moisturize my head rather to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.890 
oil to moisturize my head rather to
prevent<00:03:36.830> shreds<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:40.300> then<00:03:41.300> just<00:03:41.600> started

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
prevent shreds and then just started

00:03:41.900 --> 00:04:02.900 
prevent shreds and then just started
separating<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.709> breeze

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.400 

and<00:04:03.910> with<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.270> bread<00:04:04.480> separator<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.230> can

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
and with the bread separator you can

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.500 
and with the bread separator you can
further<00:04:05.709> go<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.640> know<00:04:06.760> separate<00:04:07.300> them

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
further go and you know separate them

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.690 
further go and you know separate them
again<00:04:07.810> two<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.200> three<00:04:08.440> times<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:09.100> more<00:04:09.550> you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
again two to three times the more you

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.330 
again two to three times the more you
separated<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.480> bigger<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:10.959> gets<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.620> the

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
separated the bigger it gets and the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.820 
separated the bigger it gets and the
higher<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.850> chance<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.330> threads<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.530> as<00:04:14.680> you

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
higher the chance of threads so as you

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.640 
higher the chance of threads so as you
can<00:04:14.980> see<00:04:15.340> my<00:04:15.750> braids<00:04:16.750> out<00:04:16.780> here<00:04:17.200> isn't<00:04:17.590> very

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
can see my braids out here isn't very

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.440 
can see my braids out here isn't very
defined<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.579> that's<00:04:18.760> because<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.209> product

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
defined and that's because the product

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.479 
defined and that's because the product
that<00:04:19.660> i<00:04:19.750> was<00:04:19.900> using<00:04:19.930> didn't<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:20.950> much<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.280> a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
that i was using didn't have much of a
