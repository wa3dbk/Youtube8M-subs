 solomon of the prison camp in addition to bringing the best raw material in 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 we want help to milk the biggest party 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.600
 bush left some tricks of the estuary are not useful the ing 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 do not 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.690
 because the pickets of the field after an excellent race 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.789
 another client of the Pope 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.619
 Now comes the hardest thing to know how to cook them so that those who 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.819
 course and civic 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:34.990
 It is not so easy 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.130
 only 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.760
 people end up with the result of the time was the Spanish zeta 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.660
 the first that we have to do 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.500
 take out the draw tickets 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 as they come with a bit of blood we dry it open kitchen cup 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 this will prevent that when we put the lasarte the gtc and casual 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.540
 low temperature 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.889
 if the low temperature we will not remove jesÃºs muds and torrijos 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.990
 I think this house hurricane 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.990
 Well, we already have eco with kitchen paper 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.200
 hundreds of rooms install it or anything 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.780
 at home also causes you to lose water 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 we put a little oil 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.910
 have the iron 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.050
 the oil is what will make us 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.970
 that pull out the rich brown coast that practices the letter 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 and you already know that the flesh as the cooked flesh lowe the meat jaca huesca that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.550
 has the brown tickle 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 We already have this ambient temperature 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.790
 it sounds beginning xix 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.600
 that means that you lose water 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.850
 but soon it will stop ringing 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.590
 and that will mean that the bottom part is already done 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 and that the fillet does not lose juiciness 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.010
 us for making the ipscs 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.880
 this does not 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.650
 these premises that I lose gives me 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.180
 the smaller a fillet is, the thinner the stronger the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.260
 fire remembering and the fatter slower 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.850
 in this way to make red gurgles by lifting slowly 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.170
 but the little one 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.839
 It has to be very strong and very fast 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.839
 bestial nicknamed the papazo bottle on the other hand 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.159
 he has already removed the caramelitos 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.649
 more or less 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.469
 doctors than the fords 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.469
 at the same time and taste of rich meat 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:27.119
 and little else because this if we leave it escualos loses the work 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.289
 You can already tell that these profiles 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:37.580
 we can stop it now 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.299
 and if we want rough laments traps art 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 xoom 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.650
 very valuable the fires by with a bit of brandy a little bit of him a little 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.369
 hot 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:47.439
 reduce them 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.179
 with a bit of the trace a pepper-rich sauce to decide 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.209
 the
