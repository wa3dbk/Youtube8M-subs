00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.360 
rotated she's gonna get a downgrade on
that<00:04:37.510> well<00:04:38.510> certainly<00:04:38.840> an<00:04:38.960> under<00:04:39.169> rotation<00:04:39.740> if

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
that well certainly an under rotation if

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.030 
that well certainly an under rotation if
not<00:04:40.669> a<00:04:40.699> down<00:04:40.940> break<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.419> was<00:04:41.750> fantastic

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
so difficult to get that position and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.830 
so difficult to get that position and
