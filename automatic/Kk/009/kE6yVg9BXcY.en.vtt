underneath there just bend those out of
the<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.609> can<00:02:36.639> get<00:02:36.790> them<00:02:37.000> underneath

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
the way so we can get them underneath

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.720 
the way so we can get them underneath
the<00:02:37.569> ground<00:02:37.900> level<00:02:38.409> now<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.099> want<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.519> rid

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the ground level now we want to get rid

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.709 
the ground level now we want to get rid
of<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.060> burlap<00:02:40.719> root<00:02:41.079> sack<00:02:41.879> by<00:02:42.879> cutting<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.629> a

of the burlap root sack by cutting in a

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.869 
of the burlap root sack by cutting in a
few<00:02:43.930> spots<00:02:44.079> like<00:02:44.499> this<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.340> we're<00:02:45.609> just<00:02:45.700> going

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
few spots like this and we're just going

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.550 
few spots like this and we're just going
to<00:02:45.909> fold<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.359> back<00:02:46.419> around<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.049> side<00:02:47.290> so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
to fold that back around the side so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.500 
to fold that back around the side so
that<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.829> soil<00:02:48.159> is<00:02:48.280> open<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.669> the<00:02:48.700> sunlight

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that that soil is open to the sunlight

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720 
that that soil is open to the sunlight
and<00:02:49.689> the<00:02:49.780> water<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.230> get<00:02:50.799> good<00:02:51.010> penetration

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
and the water and get good penetration

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.640 
and the water and get good penetration
there<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:52.419> this<00:02:52.719> way<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:52.900> can<00:02:52.989> also<00:02:53.230> keep<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
there but this way we can also keep the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.709 
there but this way we can also keep the
roots<00:02:53.859> together<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.939> we<00:02:55.000> want<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.239> feed<00:02:55.540> that

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
roots together now we want to feed that

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.390 
roots together now we want to feed that
space<00:02:56.109> between<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.709> brute<00:02:56.889> ball<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.310> the

space between the brute ball and the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.670 
space between the brute ball and the
hole<00:02:57.579> with<00:02:57.790> some<00:02:57.969> nice<00:02:58.449> topsoil<00:02:59.109> when<00:02:59.379> we<00:02:59.500> mix

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
hole with some nice topsoil when we mix

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.289 
hole with some nice topsoil when we mix
a<00:02:59.769> little<00:02:59.889> compost<00:03:00.400> material<00:03:00.579> with<00:03:00.909> this<00:03:01.120> to

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
a little compost material with this to

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.640 
a little compost material with this to
make<00:03:01.419> sure<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:01.780> got<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.109> nutrient<00:03:02.560> in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
make sure it's got some nutrient in

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.470 
make sure it's got some nutrient in
there<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.549> put<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:03.939> little<00:03:04.060> bit<00:03:04.239> at<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.449> time

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
there and put it a little bit at a time

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.780 
there and put it a little bit at a time
and<00:03:04.989> then<00:03:05.019> be<00:03:05.620> nice<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.980> go<00:03:06.099> ahead<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:06.370> tamper

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
and then be nice to go ahead and tamper

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.059 
and then be nice to go ahead and tamper

two-by-four something that's nearby so

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.379 
two-by-four something that's nearby so
we<00:03:11.620> can<00:03:11.829> eliminate<00:03:12.069> some<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.579> soil<00:03:12.969> voids

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
we can eliminate some of the soil voids

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.509 
we can eliminate some of the soil voids
that<00:03:13.540> may<00:03:13.780> be<00:03:13.840> around<00:03:14.109> those<00:03:14.290> roots<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.799> may

that may be around those roots and may

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.009 
that may be around those roots and may
also<00:03:15.730> make<00:03:16.000> sure<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.449> stays<00:03:16.480> nice<00:03:16.959> and

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
also make sure that it stays nice and

also make sure that it stays nice and
secure<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.889> hole<00:03:18.609> that<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:18.939> planted<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.329> in

secure in the hole that we planted it in

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.199 
secure in the hole that we planted it in
now<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.169> bought<00:03:20.349> some<00:03:20.620> store-bought<00:03:21.209> compost

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
now we bought some store-bought compost

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.399 
now we bought some store-bought compost
to<00:03:22.329> make<00:03:22.449> sure<00:03:22.659> that<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:22.930> got<00:03:23.079> some<00:03:23.290> good

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
to make sure that it's got some good

to make sure that it's got some good
nutrient<00:03:23.829> around<00:03:24.129> those<00:03:24.340> roots<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.659> they<00:03:25.780> get

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
nutrient around those roots so they get

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.229 
nutrient around those roots so they get
a<00:03:25.959> good<00:03:26.169> start<00:03:26.500> tamp<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.549> down<00:03:27.669> with<00:03:28.090> our

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
a good start tamp that down with our

a good start tamp that down with our
hands<00:03:28.449> loosely<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.139> then<00:03:29.829> put<00:03:30.669> more<00:03:30.849> soil<00:03:31.120> in

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269

hands loosely and then put more soil in
there<00:03:31.389> then<00:03:31.540> we<00:03:31.599> want<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.810> finish<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.079> off<00:03:32.290> by

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
there then we want to finish it off by

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.929 
there then we want to finish it off by
tampering<00:03:32.919> it<00:03:33.069> down<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.489> make<00:03:33.609> sure<00:03:33.669> that<00:03:33.879> we

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
tampering it down to make sure that we

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.759 
tampering it down to make sure that we
don't<00:03:34.030> have<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.269> whole<00:03:34.359> lot<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.659> voids<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.290> we

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
don't have a whole lot of voids and we

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.009 
don't have a whole lot of voids and we
get<00:03:35.919> a<00:03:35.949> good<00:03:36.129> adhesion<00:03:37.120> between<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.629> new<00:03:37.780> hole
