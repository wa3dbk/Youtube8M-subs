00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
loves and so is the big face and so I
think<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.020> think<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.469> really

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
think actually I think it's a really

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.720 
think actually I think it's a really
really<00:00:56.340> interesting<00:00:57.620> concept<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.980> takes

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really interesting concept and takes

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.850 
really interesting concept and takes
wrestling<00:01:00.390> closer<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.350> being<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:02.840> television

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
wrestling closer to being a television

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.880 
wrestling closer to being a television
episodic<00:01:04.909> type<00:01:05.909> thing<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:07.049> being<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.530> sport

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
episodic type thing than being a sport

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
episodic type thing than being a sport
actually<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> think<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.610> comes<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.930> towards

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
actually I think it comes in or towards

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
actually I think it comes in or towards
television<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> anything<00:01:11.189> else<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
television and anything else which is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
television and anything else which is
interesting<00:01:12.299> thought<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
interesting thought it would go the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
interesting thought it would go the
other<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.710> thought<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
other way you to thought really if you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
other way you to thought really if you
if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.869> rid<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> hills<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
if you if you get rid of hills and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
if you if you get rid of hills and
places<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> surface<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> makes<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> seem

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
places on the surface that makes it seem

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.179 
places on the surface that makes it seem
like<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> sport<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.070> know

there's no defined heels and faces in
other<00:01:22.680> sports<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> truth<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.970> sport<00:01:24.299> has

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
other sports but in truth all sport has

other sports but in truth all sport has
that<00:01:24.720> even<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.369> lot

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that even if it's kind of it's a lot

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.179 
that even if it's kind of it's a lot
more<00:01:27.150> subjective<00:01:27.900> whereas<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.810> television

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
more subjective whereas in television

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.350 
more subjective whereas in television
especially<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.610> way<00:01:32.700> television<00:01:33.090> has<00:01:33.180> been<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
especially the way television has been I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
especially the way television has been I
mean<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.659> look<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:33.960> hbo's<00:01:34.829> productions

over the last sore 10 years or so they

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
over the last sore 10 years or so they

squash<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.200> explain<00:01:55.619> my<00:01:55.829> theory<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.549> how<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
squash I explain my theory about how the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.929 
squash I explain my theory about how the
person<00:01:58.079> who<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> head<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.759> new

curve in where wrestling's go into the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.499 
curve in where wrestling's go into the
person<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.460> monetizes<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.210> might<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
person that monetizes it might use the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.380 
person that monetizes it might use the
example<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.619> superhero<00:02:05.310> error<00:02:05.759> or<00:02:06.270> error

this<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.140> direction<00:02:22.319> at<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> entire

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this is the direction at the entire

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.289 
this is the direction at the entire
industry<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:23.909> only<00:02:24.000> does<00:02:24.180> it

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
industry is going so not only does it

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.140 
industry is going so not only does it
prove<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.690> point<00:02:25.519> but<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.580> won't<00:02:27.000> actually

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
prove that point but I won't actually

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.759 
prove that point but I won't actually
just<00:02:27.510> pros<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.840> point<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.409> I<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
just pros that point and I just I just

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.259 
just pros that point and I just I just
for<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.099> moment<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.790> want<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> Pat

me<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> back<00:02:30.599> using<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> webcam<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
me on the back using the webcam is that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.750 
me on the back using the webcam is that
no<00:02:33.360> nothing<00:02:33.690> okay<00:02:33.959> cool<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:34.829> but<00:02:35.310> no<00:02:35.430> because

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
no nothing okay cool but but no because

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.130 
no nothing okay cool but but no because

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it because it totally makes sense that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.569 
it because it totally makes sense that
that's<00:02:37.560> what's<00:02:37.829> going<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.069> happen<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.519> it

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
that's what's going to happen is it

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.670 
that's what's going to happen is it
risky<00:02:38.940> strategy<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.720> course<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.349> risky

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
risky strategy of course is a risky

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.809 
risky strategy of course is a risky
strategy<00:02:40.769> right<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:41.310> from<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.640> business

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
strategy right now from a business

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.520 
strategy right now from a business
perspective<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.629> can<00:02:43.019> understand<00:02:43.379> why<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
perspective I can understand why the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.990 
perspective I can understand why the
Ruiz<00:02:43.860> doing<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.579> how<00:02:44.730> show

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
Ruiz doing it because there how show

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240 
Ruiz doing it because there how show
attendances<00:02:45.660> are<00:02:45.810> down<00:02:46.019> okay<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.069> reason

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
attendances are down okay now the reason

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
attendances are down okay now the reason
that's<00:02:47.489> really<00:02:47.790> important<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.390> because<00:02:48.420> where

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that's really important is because where

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.360 
that's really important is because where
that<00:02:49.379> becomes<00:02:49.500> confusing<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.609> that<00:02:52.129> you<00:02:53.129> can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
that becomes confusing is that you can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.940 
that becomes confusing is that you can
it<00:02:53.519> yeah<00:02:53.879> if<00:02:54.629> you<00:02:54.780> don't<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.019> halos<00:02:55.379> or<00:02:55.500> faces

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
it yeah if you don't have halos or faces

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.319 
it yeah if you don't have halos or faces
you're<00:02:56.129> going<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> very<00:02:56.700> jumbled

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
you're going to have a very jumbled

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.190 
you're going to have a very jumbled
mixture<00:02:58.260> for<00:02:58.799> it's<00:02:58.950> not<00:02:59.159> like<00:02:59.340> MMA<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:01.049> that

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
mixture for it's not like MMA it in that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050 
mixture for it's not like MMA it in that
sense<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:01.739> because<00:03:01.799> what's<00:03:02.609> happening<00:03:02.670> is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
sense right because what's happening is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.569 
sense right because what's happening is
if<00:03:03.269> you've<00:03:03.450> got<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:04.290> you've<00:03:04.890> got<00:03:05.040> no<00:03:05.159> defined

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
if you've got if you've got no defined

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.970 
if you've got if you've got no defined
hills<00:03:05.819> or<00:03:06.060> faces<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.780> really<00:03:07.230> really<00:03:07.500> makes<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
hills or faces it really really makes a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.710 
hills or faces it really really makes a
massive<00:03:08.280> difference<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:09.030> how<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.359> crowd

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
massive difference to how the crowd

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.920 
massive difference to how the crowd
reacting<00:03:10.230> live<00:03:10.409> okay<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:12.000> example<00:03:12.299> when

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
reacting live okay it for example when

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750 
reacting live okay it for example when
you're<00:03:13.049> running<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.290> wrestling<00:03:13.650> show<00:03:13.760> white

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
you're running a wrestling show white

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.030 
you're running a wrestling show white
shell<00:03:14.970> go<00:03:15.090> 111<00:03:15.629> deeper<00:03:16.500> when<00:03:16.890> you're<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
audience is going to react based on how

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.640 
audience is going to react based on how
light<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.120> audience<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.200> example<00:03:28.290> for

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
light the audience is so for example for

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.170 
light the audience is so for example for
going<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.859> building<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.639> lighter<00:03:29.849> up

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.819 
going to building and all the lighter up
it<00:03:30.359> means<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.049> crowd<00:03:31.260> heats<00:03:31.500> probably

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
it means that the crowd heats probably

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.259 
it means that the crowd heats probably
going<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.010> be<00:03:32.099> less<00:03:32.340> because<00:03:32.730> people<00:03:33.150> feel

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
going to be less because people feel

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.509 
going to be less because people feel
more<00:03:33.329> self-conscious<00:03:34.169> about<00:03:34.590> making<00:03:35.190> sound

that the audience for the final
sequences<00:03:44.069> are<00:03:44.220> standing<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.639> their<00:03:44.790> feet<00:03:44.819> but

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
sequences are standing on their feet but

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.780 
sequences are standing on their feet but
the<00:03:45.329> audience<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.169> completely<00:03:46.709> lit<00:03:46.949> right<00:03:47.549> so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the audience is completely lit right so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.039 
the audience is completely lit right so
that<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.060> me<00:03:48.090> was<00:03:48.239> more<00:03:48.569> of<00:03:48.660> an<00:03:48.750> achievement

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
that to me was more of an achievement

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.839 
that to me was more of an achievement
than<00:03:49.290> dressing<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.980> much<00:03:50.190> bigger<00:03:50.400> building

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
than dressing in a much bigger building

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.309 
than dressing in a much bigger building
where<00:03:51.000> it's<00:03:51.150> dark<00:03:51.389> because<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.230> was

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
where it's dark because it was

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.379 
where it's dark because it was
essentially<00:03:52.799> really<00:03:53.160> well-lit<00:03:53.669> social<00:03:54.150> club

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
essentially really well-lit social club

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.539 
essentially really well-lit social club
so<00:03:54.690> there's<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> tiny<00:03:55.139> match<00:03:55.410> but<00:03:55.680> people<00:03:55.709> I've

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
so there's a tiny match but people I've

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.589 
so there's a tiny match but people I've
found<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.940> more<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.239> an<00:03:57.329> achievement

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
found that more of an achievement

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.629 
found that more of an achievement
because<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:58.199> crowd<00:03:58.680> attracts<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.160> crowd<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
because a crowd attracts a crowd and

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.490 
because a crowd attracts a crowd and
people<00:04:00.150> follow<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.480> herd<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:01.109> you've<00:04:01.349> got<00:04:01.470> a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
people follow the herd if you've got a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.409 
people follow the herd if you've got a
wrestling<00:04:01.889> show<00:04:01.919> and<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.879> audience<00:04:03.120> doesn't

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
wrestling show and the audience doesn't

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.599 
wrestling show and the audience doesn't
know<00:04:03.599> who<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.870> cheer<00:04:04.199> for<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.889> when<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.340> cheer

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
know who to cheer for and when to cheer

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.430 
know who to cheer for and when to cheer
and<00:04:05.819> it's<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.269> subjective<00:04:06.900> wrestling<00:04:07.410> fans

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
and it's that subjective wrestling fans

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.140 
and it's that subjective wrestling fans
are<00:04:07.769> not<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:07.949> most<00:04:08.069> confident<00:04:08.579> of<00:04:08.669> people<00:04:09.000> it

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
are not the most confident of people it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.119 
are not the most confident of people it
is<00:04:09.329> an<00:04:09.480> MMA<00:04:09.900> right<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:10.739> that's<00:04:10.919> going<00:04:11.069> to

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
is an MMA right so that's going to

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.460 
is an MMA right so that's going to
slowly<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.699> surely<00:04:12.030> put<00:04:12.180> pressure<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.900> the

that<00:04:20.609> sense<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.970> unity<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.599> what<00:04:21.840> you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that sense of unity is what you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.450 
that sense of unity is what you
explained<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.469> with<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.770> football<00:04:22.979> analogy

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
explained in with the football analogy

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.180 
explained in with the football analogy
right<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:24.479> need<00:04:25.169> that<00:04:25.289> sense<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.710> unity<00:04:26.010> and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
right you need that sense of unity and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.730 
right you need that sense of unity and
that's<00:04:26.430> what

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
that's what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.559 
that's what
