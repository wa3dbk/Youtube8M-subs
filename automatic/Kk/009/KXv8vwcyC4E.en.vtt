00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
well casein is a component of milk

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.290 
well casein is a component of milk

casein<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> commonly<00:00:51.300> used<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.230> make<00:00:52.440> dairy

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
casein is commonly used to make dairy

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
casein is commonly used to make dairy
products<00:00:53.370> such<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.550> cheese<00:00:53.700> and<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.870> makes

supplementation<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:55.980> casein<00:00:56.460> protein

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
supplementation with casein protein

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
supplementation with casein protein
interesting<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> casein<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> slowly

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
interesting is that casein is slowly

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
interesting is that casein is slowly
digested<00:01:00.210> over<00:01:00.300> several<00:01:00.690> hours<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.620> means

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
digested over several hours this means

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
digested over several hours this means
that<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> steady<00:01:02.910> release<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that you get a steady release of the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.900 
that you get a steady release of the
amino<00:01:04.050> acid<00:01:04.500> building<00:01:04.860> blocks<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> casein

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
amino acid building blocks in the casein

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.910 
amino acid building blocks in the casein
protein<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.840> several<00:01:07.140> hours<00:01:07.289> after

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
protein for several hours after

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.730 
protein for several hours after
consuming<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> best<00:01:09.690> times<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.440> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
consuming it so the best times for you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
consuming it so the best times for you
to<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.100> casein<00:01:11.700> protein<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.509> when<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.930> not

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to use casein protein is when you're not

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.980 
to use casein protein is when you're not
going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> eat<00:01:13.890> again<00:01:14.009> for<00:01:14.160> several<00:01:14.729> hours

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
going to eat again for several hours

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.770 
going to eat again for several hours
because<00:01:15.990> casein<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> slowly<00:01:17.280> digested<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.660> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
because casein is slowly digested one of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.900 
because casein is slowly digested one of
the<00:01:18.869> best<00:01:19.140> times<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> take<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.580> night

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
the best times to take it is at night

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.840 
the best times to take it is at night
the<00:01:21.570> idea<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.470> consuming<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.280> slow

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the idea here is that consuming a slow

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
the idea here is that consuming a slow
digesting<00:01:24.479> protein<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.020> casing<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.560> bedtime

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
digesting protein like casing at bedtime

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
digesting protein like casing at bedtime
will<00:01:26.610> help<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> prevent<00:01:27.299> muscle<00:01:27.840> breakdown

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
will help to prevent muscle breakdown

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.450 
will help to prevent muscle breakdown
while<00:01:28.590> you're<00:01:28.770> sleeping

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
while you're sleeping

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.270 
while you're sleeping
by<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.390> nonfat<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.290> low-fat<00:01:31.380> cottage

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
by the way nonfat or low-fat cottage

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
by the way nonfat or low-fat cottage
cheese<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.210> high<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.600> casing<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.229> not

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
cheese is also high in casing but not

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
cheese is also high in casing but not
everybody<00:01:34.829> likes<00:01:35.100> cottage<00:01:35.549> cheese<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.450> that's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
everybody likes cottage cheese so that's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
everybody likes cottage cheese so that's
when<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> high<00:01:37.380> quality<00:01:37.710> casein<00:01:38.400> protein

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
when a high quality casein protein

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
when a high quality casein protein
powder<00:01:39.180> comes<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.720> handy<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.530> simply<00:01:40.920> mix

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
powder comes in handy just simply mix

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
powder comes in handy just simply mix
your<00:01:41.369> casing<00:01:41.729> protein<00:01:42.090> powder<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.810> some

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
your casing protein powder in with some

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.800 
your casing protein powder in with some
skim<00:01:43.380> milk<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> blender<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.400> drink<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.299> know

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
skim milk and a blender and drink I know

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
skim milk and a blender and drink I know
that<00:01:46.079> your<00:01:46.200> question<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:46.770> casein<00:01:47.490> but

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that your question was about casein but

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.429 
that your question was about casein but
let's<00:01:47.850> also<00:01:48.030> talk<00:01:48.360> about<00:01:48.420> whey<00:01:48.810> protein<00:01:49.259> for

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
let's also talk about whey protein for

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.679 
let's also talk about whey protein for
just<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> second<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.670> mentioned<00:01:51.060> earlier<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
just a second as I mentioned earlier the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
just a second as I mentioned earlier the
whey<00:01:51.960> protein<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> derived<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.310> milk<00:01:53.520> also

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
whey protein is derived from milk also

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.990 
whey protein is derived from milk also
but<00:01:54.540> unlike<00:01:54.899> casein<00:01:55.590> whey<00:01:55.979> proteins<00:01:56.520> digest

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
but unlike casein whey proteins digest

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
but unlike casein whey proteins digest
that<00:01:57.119> very<00:01:57.600> quickly<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.380> consumed

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that very quickly when it's consumed

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
that very quickly when it's consumed
making<00:01:59.610> its<00:01:59.759> amino<00:02:00.060> acids<00:02:00.509> available

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
making its amino acids available

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
making its amino acids available
immediately<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.829> that's<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:02.369> makes<00:02:02.579> way

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
immediately and that's what makes way

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.179 
immediately and that's what makes way
ideal<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.899> consuming<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.680> after<00:02:05.040> your

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
ideal for consuming right after your

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.359 
ideal for consuming right after your
workout<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.719> summarize<00:02:07.170> use<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.890> casein

workout so to summarize use the casein

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
workout so to summarize use the casein
protein<00:02:08.910> right<00:02:09.269> before<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.140> sleep<00:02:10.410> or
