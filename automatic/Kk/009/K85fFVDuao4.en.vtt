00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
expensive electronics equipment set up

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.170 
expensive electronics equipment set up
right<00:00:58.610> here<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.180> I<00:01:00.170> can't<00:01:00.559> get<00:01:00.710> wet<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.790> it's

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
wait for the camera to take a picture

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.400 
wait for the camera to take a picture
and<00:01:16.580> then<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.630> wipe<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.990> drops<00:01:18.200> off

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
and then I have to wipe the drops off

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.530 
and then I have to wipe the drops off
the<00:01:18.530> lens<00:01:18.910> this<00:01:19.910> is<00:01:19.970> silly

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.240 

yeah<00:01:23.540> I'm<00:01:23.690> doing<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.050> so<00:01:24.680> I<00:01:24.710> get<00:01:24.920> out<00:01:25.009> of<00:01:25.070> the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
yeah I'm doing it so I get out of the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.460 
yeah I'm doing it so I get out of the
frame<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:26.540> then<00:01:26.690> once<00:01:26.899> I<00:01:27.020> hear<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.290> shutter

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
frame and then once I hear the shutter

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.350 
frame and then once I hear the shutter
click<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.160> jump<00:01:28.610> out<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:28.850> front<00:01:28.910> of<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.180> frame

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
click I jump out in front of the frame

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.910 
click I jump out in front of the frame
and<00:01:29.479> wipe<00:01:29.630> off<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.990> lens<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.470> jump<00:01:30.800> back

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
and wipe off the lens and jump back

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.139 
and wipe off the lens and jump back
behind<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.310> frame<00:01:31.460> before<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.820> inner

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
behind the frame before the inner

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.050 
behind the frame before the inner
kilometer<00:01:32.630> triggers<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.229> shutter<00:01:33.410> again<00:01:34.060> I'm

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
kilometer triggers the shutter again I'm

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.580 
kilometer triggers the shutter again I'm
hoping<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.570> isn't<00:01:35.720> gonna<00:01:35.899> last<00:01:35.990> very<00:01:36.289> long

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
hoping this isn't gonna last very long

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.460 
hoping this isn't gonna last very long
and<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.670> can<00:01:37.850> keep<00:01:38.090> those<00:01:38.300> drops<00:01:38.750> on<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.259> lens

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
and I can keep those drops on the lens

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.210 
and I can keep those drops on the lens
at<00:01:39.680> bay<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:41.350> make<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.500> one<00:01:42.680> continuous

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
at bay and make it one continuous

00:01:43.220 --> 00:02:08.120 
at bay and make it one continuous
time-lapse<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.789> won't<00:01:43.940> have<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.180> stop

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.109 

well<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:09.340> time<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.610> lose<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.940> light<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
well it's time to lose the light a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.740 
well it's time to lose the light a
little<00:02:10.209> bit<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:12.120> you've<00:02:13.120> got<00:02:13.270> these<00:02:13.420> cool

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
little bit but you've got these cool

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.210 
little bit but you've got these cool
patterns<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.380> light<00:02:14.530> moving<00:02:14.890> around<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
patterns of light moving around on the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.610 
patterns of light moving around on the
hills<00:02:15.490> out<00:02:15.670> there<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.090> they're<00:02:16.870> gonna<00:02:16.990> they

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
hills out there and they're gonna they

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.600 
hills out there and they're gonna they
don't<00:02:17.770> look<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:17.920> they're<00:02:18.190> moving<00:02:18.430> at<00:02:18.520> all

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
don't look like they're moving at all

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.010 
don't look like they're moving at all
right<00:02:18.819> now<00:02:18.850> but<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.270> time-lapse<00:02:19.510> they'll<00:02:19.900> be

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
right now but in time-lapse they'll be

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.600 
right now but in time-lapse they'll be
crawling<00:02:20.440> all<00:02:20.530> over<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.920> mountainside<00:02:21.280> I'd

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
crawling all over that mountainside I'd

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.040 
crawling all over that mountainside I'd

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
than two inches of Awesomeness left our

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.800 
than two inches of Awesomeness left our
lights<00:03:01.510> gone<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:03.090> time<00:03:04.090> lapse<00:03:04.300> kind<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.540> over<00:03:04.780> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
lights gone so time lapse kind of over I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.170 
lights gone so time lapse kind of over I
just<00:03:04.900> reset<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.530> time-lapse<00:03:05.860> down<00:03:06.100> here<00:03:06.400> on

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
just reset the time-lapse down here on

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.650 
just reset the time-lapse down here on
the<00:03:07.360> track<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.080> dolly<00:03:08.260> slider<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.660> but

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
the track on the dolly slider and but

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.350 
the track on the dolly slider and but
there's<00:03:10.989> no<00:03:11.140> more<00:03:11.350> dynamic<00:03:11.860> light<00:03:12.070> left<00:03:12.360> so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
there's no more dynamic light left so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.009 
there's no more dynamic light left so
it's<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.600> gonna<00:03:13.810> kind<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:16.019> blueish

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
it's just gonna kind of be a blueish

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.300 
it's just gonna kind of be a blueish
kind<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.560> grayscale<00:03:18.930> dusk<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.320> dark<00:03:20.650> sort<00:03:21.190> of

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
kind of grayscale dusk to dark sort of

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.720 
kind of grayscale dusk to dark sort of
time<00:03:21.489> lapse<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.750> shooting<00:03:22.989> right<00:03:23.260> now

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
time lapse in that shooting right now

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.330 
time lapse in that shooting right now
so<00:03:25.390> that's<00:03:25.599> what<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.870> looks<00:03:26.080> like<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.620> thought

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
so that's what that looks like I thought

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.820 
so that's what that looks like I thought
maybe<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.730> Sun<00:03:27.910> would<00:03:28.090> poke<00:03:28.270> out<00:03:28.739> through<00:03:29.739> the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
maybe the Sun would poke out through the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.960 
maybe the Sun would poke out through the
bottom<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.190> clouds<00:03:30.400> there<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.700> we<00:03:30.790> get<00:03:30.940> a

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
bottom of the clouds there and we get a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.009 
bottom of the clouds there and we get a
little<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.269> encore<00:03:31.870> dramatic<00:03:32.410> light<00:03:32.590> but

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
little like encore dramatic light but

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.570 
little like encore dramatic light but
the<00:03:35.019> haze<00:03:35.230> on<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.470> horizon<00:03:35.620> swallowed<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.459> all

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
the haze on the horizon swallowed it all

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.790 
the haze on the horizon swallowed it all
up<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:39.129> that's<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.550> now<00:03:40.360> I<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:41.050> get<00:03:41.769> a

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
up and so that's it now I just get a

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.570 
up and so that's it now I just get a
howl<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.130> these<00:03:42.220> back<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.610> studio<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
howl of these back to the studio and and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.350 
howl of these back to the studio and and
process<00:03:45.580> them<00:03:45.700> all<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.030> string<00:03:46.269> them

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
process them all and string them

00:03:46.360 --> 00:04:41.760 
process them all and string them
together<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.840> see<00:03:47.200> what<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.410> looks<00:03:47.560> like

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.890 

so<00:04:42.770> I'm<00:04:42.830> Devin<00:04:43.100> backup<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.550> missions<00:04:43.910> got

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
so I'm Devin backup to the missions got

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.420 
so I'm Devin backup to the missions got
a<00:04:44.930> great<00:04:45.140> time<00:04:45.380> lapse<00:04:45.620> last<00:04:45.830> night<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.070> think

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
a great time lapse last night I think

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.740 
a great time lapse last night I think
any<00:04:46.670> time<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:46.910> get<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.060> rainbow<00:04:47.270> in<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.510> frame

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
any time you get a rainbow in the frame

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.530 
any time you get a rainbow in the frame
that's<00:04:48.050> that's<00:04:48.440> pretty<00:04:48.590> hard<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.920> beat

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
that's that's pretty hard to beat

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.820 
that's that's pretty hard to beat
fizzled<00:04:50.540> out<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.690> little<00:04:50.930> bit<00:04:51.020> at<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.260> end<00:04:51.350> but

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
fizzled out a little bit at the end but

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.890 
fizzled out a little bit at the end but
it<00:04:52.670> was<00:04:52.760> just<00:04:52.940> such<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.120> great<00:04:53.240> night<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.660> was<00:04:53.750> so

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
it was just such a great night it was so

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.270 
it was just such a great night it was so
awesome<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.350> be<00:04:54.530> up<00:04:54.620> there<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.890> it's<00:04:54.980> so<00:04:55.100> close

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
awesome to be up there and it's so close

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.790 
awesome to be up there and it's so close
to<00:04:55.400> my<00:04:55.490> house<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.850> figured<00:04:56.090> why<00:04:56.210> not<00:04:56.620> drive<00:04:57.620> back

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.380 

it's<00:06:38.380> awesome<00:06:38.680> because<00:06:38.830> it's<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:40.120> winds
