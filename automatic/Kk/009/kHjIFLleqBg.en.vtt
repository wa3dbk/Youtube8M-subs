they<00:04:18.480> probably<00:04:18.780> glued<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:20.000> maybe<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.239> was

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
they probably glued it or maybe it was

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.630 
they probably glued it or maybe it was
originally<00:04:22.080> supposed<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.500> like<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:23.040> I'm

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
originally supposed to be like this I'm

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.080 
originally supposed to be like this I'm
not<00:04:23.850> sure<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.300> either<00:04:24.720> way<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.380> just<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:26.040> know<00:04:26.940> I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
not sure but either way I just I know I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.250 
not sure but either way I just I know I
wouldn't<00:04:27.360> have<00:04:27.450> been<00:04:27.510> able<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.750> do<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.960> this

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
wouldn't have been able to do it this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.020 
wouldn't have been able to do it this
much<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.650> good<00:04:28.800> job<00:04:29.010> I've<00:04:29.220> built<00:04:29.730> some

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
much of a good job I've built some

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.740 
much of a good job I've built some
myself<00:04:30.570> from<00:04:31.440> scratch<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.540> always<00:04:33.540> have

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
myself from scratch and I always have

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.600 
myself from scratch and I always have
problems<00:04:34.170> with<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.560> there's<00:04:35.070> always<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.310> spot

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
problems with it there's always a spot

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.430 
problems with it there's always a spot
that<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.880> don't<00:04:36.270> connect<00:04:36.780> fully<00:04:37.080> they're

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
that I don't connect fully they're

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.710 
that I don't connect fully they're
always<00:04:37.640> like<00:04:38.640> some<00:04:38.850> tough<00:04:39.090> spots<00:04:39.240> where<00:04:39.600> you

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
always like some tough spots where you

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.960 
always like some tough spots where you
don't<00:04:39.870> want<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.080> go<00:04:40.200> too<00:04:40.260> far<00:04:40.770> because<00:04:41.730> you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
don't want to go too far because you

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.610 
don't want to go too far because you
could<00:04:42.300> end<00:04:42.420> up<00:04:42.480> breaking<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.440> just

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
could end up breaking it so you just

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.400 
could end up breaking it so you just
kind<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.010> leave<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.930> this<00:04:46.200> one

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
kind of leave it like that but this one

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.350 
kind of leave it like that but this one
I'm<00:04:46.500> glad<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.830> was<00:04:46.920> already<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.640> there

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
I'm glad it was already like this there

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.910 
I'm glad it was already like this there
aren't<00:04:48.510> any<00:04:48.600> missing<00:04:49.080> pieces<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
aren't any missing pieces this is the

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.620 
aren't any missing pieces this is the
whole<00:04:50.220> figure<00:04:50.700> itself<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.790> let's<00:04:53.790> see<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.330> am

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
whole figure itself and let's see I am

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.270 
whole figure itself and let's see I am
turning<00:04:55.200> on<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.440> how<00:04:55.530> much<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.770> paid<00:04:56.040> for<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.250> I
