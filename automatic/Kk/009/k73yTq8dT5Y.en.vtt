using molding paste use any type of
molding<00:01:21.969> paste<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.390> want<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.680> can<00:01:23.860> tape<00:01:24.100> this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
molding paste you want you can tape this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.429 
molding paste you want you can tape this
down<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.969> you<00:01:25.270> want<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.479> keep<00:01:25.689> it<00:01:25.840> steady

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
down if you want to keep it steady

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.990 
down if you want to keep it steady
I'm<00:01:26.740> just<00:01:27.070> gonna<00:01:27.189> put<00:01:27.460> my<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:29.799> bucket<00:01:30.280> on<00:01:30.640> it<00:01:30.820> my

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
I'm just gonna put my my bucket on it my

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
I'm just gonna put my my bucket on it my
jar<00:01:31.799> okay<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.130> then<00:01:33.430> you<00:01:35.640> fill<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:36.969> I<00:01:37.299> guess

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
jar okay and then you fill it in I guess

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.999 
jar okay and then you fill it in I guess
swap<00:01:38.469> it<00:01:38.619> on<00:01:39.810> try<00:01:40.810> not<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.320> push<00:01:41.619> too<00:01:41.649> hard

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
swap it on try not to push too hard

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.380 
swap it on try not to push too hard
because<00:01:42.549> you<00:01:42.700> don't<00:01:42.820> want<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.270> go

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
because you don't want it to go

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.590 
because you don't want it to go
underneath<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.740> isn't<00:01:45.009> exact<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:46.270> not

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
underneath and this isn't exact is not

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.800 
underneath and this isn't exact is not
sorry<00:01:47.109> is<00:01:47.259> not<00:01:47.469> an<00:01:47.680> exact<00:01:48.070> science

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
sorry is not an exact science

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.010 
sorry is not an exact science
you're<00:01:50.229> not<00:01:50.409> gonna<00:01:50.590> get<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.799> perfect<00:01:52.020> stencil

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
you're not gonna get a perfect stencil

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.279 
you're not gonna get a perfect stencil
every<00:01:53.649> time<00:01:53.890> unless<00:01:54.310> well<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.450> might<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.990> don't

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
every time unless well you might I don't

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.190 
every time unless well you might I don't
I<00:01:56.799> do<00:01:57.670> not<00:01:57.939> get<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.210> perfect<00:01:58.600> stencil<00:01:58.990> every

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
I do not get a perfect stencil every

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.810 
I do not get a perfect stencil every
time<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.909> keep<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.780> mind<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.549> have

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
time so keep that in mind and I have

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.859 
time so keep that in mind and I have
learned<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.560> thicker<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.429> not<00:02:06.700> better<00:02:07.149> you

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
learned that thicker is not better you

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.050 
learned that thicker is not better you
just<00:02:07.899> want<00:02:08.380> enough<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.979> cover<00:02:09.250> over<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.789> fill

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
just want enough to cover over and fill

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.050 
just want enough to cover over and fill
your<00:02:10.240> stencil<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:14.670> thicker<00:02:15.670> gets<00:02:15.880> a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
your stencil because thicker gets a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.730 
your stencil because thicker gets a
goopy<00:02:16.540> underneath<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:20.140> doesn't

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
goopy underneath and actually doesn't

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.660 
goopy underneath and actually doesn't
make<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.310> thicker<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.360> higher<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.920> what

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
make it thicker and higher because what

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.780 
make it thicker and higher because what
creates<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.530> images<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.099> you<00:02:27.129> pull<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.580> up

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
creates the the images as you pull it up

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.780 
creates the the images as you pull it up
it<00:02:28.000> forms<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.530> molding<00:02:29.890> paste

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it forms the molding paste

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.839 
it forms the molding paste
okay<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:31.940> thicker<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.660> not<00:02:32.870> better<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.730> want

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
okay so thicker is not better you want

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.250 
okay so thicker is not better you want
to<00:02:34.970> do<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.270> all<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.720> once<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.989> pull<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.110> up

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
to do this all at once and pull it up

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.210 
to do this all at once and pull it up
and<00:02:39.470> there<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.810> um<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
and there you have it um this is and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.100 
and there you have it um this is and
this<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.370> ruined<00:02:43.910> now<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.720> throw<00:02:44.930> that

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.420 

so<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.750> an<00:03:14.930> example<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.920> molding<00:03:16.220> paste

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
so this is an example of a molding paste

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.690 
so this is an example of a molding paste
stencil<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.060> did<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.299> little<00:03:17.599> while<00:03:17.810> ago<00:03:17.959> I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
stencil that I did a little while ago I

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.800 
stencil that I did a little while ago I
mixed<00:03:19.700> some<00:03:19.730> paint<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.330> there<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:20.780> see

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
mixed some paint in there you can see

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.539 
mixed some paint in there you can see
that<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.349> I<00:03:21.380> think<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.650> put<00:03:21.799> too<00:03:21.860> much<00:03:22.280> on

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
that and I think I put too much on

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.130 
that and I think I put too much on
because<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:22.970> all<00:03:23.090> kind<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.360> smooshed<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.959> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
because it all kind of smooshed it the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.890 
because it all kind of smooshed it the
sides<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.890> then<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.549> peaks<00:03:25.910> got<00:03:26.209> really<00:03:26.480> tall

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
sides and then the peaks got really tall

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.220 
sides and then the peaks got really tall
and<00:03:26.930> folded<00:03:27.620> over<00:03:27.709> cuz<00:03:28.069> they<00:03:28.220> couldn't<00:03:28.489> stand

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
and folded over cuz they couldn't stand

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.470 
and folded over cuz they couldn't stand
with<00:03:30.230> as<00:03:30.380> much<00:03:30.530> as<00:03:30.799> I<00:03:30.980> had<00:03:31.099> put<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:31.910> yeah
