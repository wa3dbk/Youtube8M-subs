00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
brightly lit more more brightly lit than

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.420 
brightly lit more more brightly lit than
the<00:03:35.329> other<00:03:35.480> balls<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:36.560> can<00:03:36.709> probably<00:03:37.010> just

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the other balls you can probably just

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.699 
the other balls you can probably just
about<00:03:37.579> tell<00:03:37.970> but<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> player<00:03:39.470> who's

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
about tell but to the player who's

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.559 
about tell but to the player who's
playing<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.220> easily<00:03:40.579> tell<00:03:40.849> and<00:03:41.420> then

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
playing can easily tell and then

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.180 
playing can easily tell and then
obviously<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.170> want<00:03:42.349> to<00:03:42.470> select<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.829> ball<00:03:43.010> to

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
obviously I want to select the ball to

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.699 
obviously I want to select the ball to
hit<00:03:43.609> next<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.540> I'm<00:03:44.750> probably<00:03:45.019> going<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.319> go<00:03:45.410> for

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
hit next so I'm probably going to go for

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.180 
hit next so I'm probably going to go for
this<00:03:45.980> one<00:03:46.040> here<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.989> then<00:03:47.989> obviously<00:03:48.410> press<00:03:48.890> Q

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
this one here and then obviously press Q

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.020 
this one here and then obviously press Q
up<00:03:49.280> again<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.680> see<00:03:52.459> what<00:03:52.640> happens

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
up again and and see what happens

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.360 
up again and and see what happens
and<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.900> gets<00:03:54.079> really<00:03:54.410> quite<00:03:54.739> in-depth<00:03:55.190> you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
and it gets really quite in-depth you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.699 
and it gets really quite in-depth you
can<00:03:55.519> change<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.970> angles<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:57.019> where<00:03:57.349> you<00:03:57.500> want

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
can change the angles of where you want

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.369 
can change the angles of where you want
to<00:03:58.340> hit<00:03:58.459> balls<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.180> there's<00:03:59.660> also<00:03:59.840> many<00:04:00.260> other

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
to hit balls and there's also many other

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.949 
to hit balls and there's also many other
modes<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:00.980> can<00:04:01.040> play<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.669> manual<00:04:02.599> does<00:04:02.780> get

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
modes you can play the manual does get

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.080 
modes you can play the manual does get
quite<00:04:03.109> in-depth<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:03.950> does<00:04:04.549> take<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.819> bit<00:04:05.030> of

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
quite in-depth and does take a bit of

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.610 
quite in-depth and does take a bit of
reading<00:04:05.389> but<00:04:05.660> once<00:04:05.840> you've<00:04:05.989> got<00:04:06.169> used<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.500> this

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
reading but once you've got used to this

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.070 
reading but once you've got used to this
game<00:04:06.859> it<00:04:07.069> really<00:04:07.549> is<00:04:07.819> good<00:04:08.269> fun

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.560 

now<00:04:11.860> this<00:04:12.010> game<00:04:12.250> certainly<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.940> really<00:04:13.360> good

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
now this game certainly is really good

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.470 
now this game certainly is really good
fun<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.620> great<00:04:14.830> little<00:04:15.250> gadget<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.940> if<00:04:16.360> you

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
fun and a great little gadget and if you

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.270 
fun and a great little gadget and if you
couldn't<00:04:16.930> fit<00:04:17.110> a<00:04:17.140> pool<00:04:17.410> table<00:04:17.650> or<00:04:17.980> snooker

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
couldn't fit a pool table or snooker

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.460 
couldn't fit a pool table or snooker
table<00:04:18.790> in<00:04:18.880> your<00:04:19.030> house<00:04:19.239> then<00:04:20.019> this<00:04:20.200> was

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
table in your house then this was

table in your house then this was
definitely<00:04:20.920> a<00:04:21.190> great<00:04:21.580> solution<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.540> still

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
definitely a great solution I still
