00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.070
 and today's first update is 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.379
 new Chernobyl house why 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.410
 Chernobyl more precisely Pripyat yes 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.539
 because I did according to the pripyat model 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.730
 there is pripyat the same there is a house almost 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.620
 so that is the monthly has not turned 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.320
 so I did not want children you are too long 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.510
 here is a window mobility 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.510
 on the outside he is the form of the letter Mr. n also available 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.090
 little shop in the shape of the letter r 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.899
 everything looks on the floor fit 4 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.180
 parade here so looks the building 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.330
 by the way I will say that this area is 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 if you start from here to this corner and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.490
 Now out of here there is nothing to say in 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.050
 there is nothing here that is unreal 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.940
 it was build and it turned out like that 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.920
 in the rest of the entrances everything is fine so 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.010
 that you don't have to worry, everything is fine 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.410
 such here I shit the balcony cool 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.050
 as in Pripyat and almost as come 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.150
 the principle was similar to give rise 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.530
 let's go to the store because it is merged building 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.080
 such here we are with them for the final 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.940
 in all cities probably well let's 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.280
 let's go hot on this grocery 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.820
 the store well what's all according to the standard here 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 shelf shelves where our species is stored 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 and all this is the whole store here we are finished 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.280
 let's see apartments 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.810
 that is , we have a contribution from the other side 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.729
 at the entrance so we go into the house in the courtyard 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.360
 Well, here we have such a corner building 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.790
 looks cool interesting but 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.220
 let's go do the porch example here 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.300
 There is an elevator to the ninth floor on exit 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.880
 there is a roof 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.830
 but the standard old apartment is acceptable 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.430
 toilet bath kitchen what else do we have 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.610
 there is a bed a chest we all principle so 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.530
 in all apartments, well, let's go up 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.190
 according to the standard roof see what 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.769
 there is broken 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.170
 how is it that I still like everything 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.420
 does not mean have fun well here we look at 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 forest so so that on the side of the entrance is interesting 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.540
 views of the avenue well and also built 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 the new house that is it appeared here 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.220
 here also well here still dofiga space 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.750
 many appeared quite 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.610
 interesting cozy atmosphere is obtained 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.510
 here at the metro station here was empty and I 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.870
 built this house 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.209
 something that I don't like a lot on the wall and 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.870
 I sometimes set these places 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.799
 houses here's a classic 7th floor to somewhere in 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.959
 two rooms 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.610
 here you can earn and see 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.650
 The main update for this release is 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.239
 how small 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.980
 a barber shop where there is a couple 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.310
 mechanisms more precisely one mechanism 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.030
 well here's a hair salon 24 by 7 that is 24 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.560
 forcibly from start who didn't know 24 hours in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.390
 the week of the seven is seven days 24 hours 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.500
 but what you do is here with us 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.930
 there are such seats where we certainly 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.760
 we cut hair all that we sit here 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.859
 we made such a mirror of me 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.489
 dense ice cacti so eyes do not 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.780
 were sick 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.880
 wilted to a window well, here we have the very banks 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.010
 at least impose time I say here with us 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.160
 here books are here by appointment of course 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.079
 all people come also here we have smith 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.760
 bench where there do not know the line for 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.700
 just in case we can visit it 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.989
 or read a book bear put well and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.150
 here is another feature of youth 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.459
 look lost light everything is fine 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.700
 seen the holy night lamp turns on 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.460
 automatically that is, let us now 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.260
 set 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.150
 our wall should be the idea of ​​the store 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.950
 dark 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.650
 my time here set this time 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.540
 put well here when the power comes 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.250
 lights we turn on and he looks 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.430
 pretty cool that is 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.890
 it turns out that it works for 24 hours 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.720
 the mechanism is very light here in that tone 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.920
 principle turned out not from wide can 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.500
 make sure less 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.360
 not here protupil a little bit but so he 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.410
 looks like we put a light sensor 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.060
 here is the daylight sensor it will react 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.120
 just though trendy so it seems 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.850
 Well, we or the diet is transmitted to this 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.370
 signal it switches on we turn on 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.860
 that's how fashion is transmitted by lamps 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.590
 principle, so take it though no matter well 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.040
 so the whole scheme looks basically 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.210
 I do n't have enough 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.670
 mechanisms and then I decided to build everything 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.560

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.240
