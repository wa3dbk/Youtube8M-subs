00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 in this week's video I'm going to start 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.960
 talk about image processing that 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.900
 In general people are looking for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.000
 make an image as treatment and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.109
 perhaps it is more important to understand the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.560
 when to make a treatment 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.560
 Image 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.670
 let us first understand that the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 image processing is something that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 can be very complex very complete 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.540
 a simple picture of a model in a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.910
 certain landscape you can do 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 treatment of skin and contrast color of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 saturation can remove food from the scene 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.750
 you can apply a standardization filter 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.020
 beyond clear skin you can treat 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 pimple 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.059
 tattoo from pillar to cinnamon remove hair 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.600
 of the eyebrow decreases the size of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.210
 ears emaciated because it leaves the arm 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.050
 but fulfilled leave the legs more 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 long let one eye more alive 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.720
 so that at 10 00 nose or tarot 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.909
 jaw jumps the soap dish at last 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.860
 It has a lot you can proceed 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 treatment and the most important 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.030
 whole story is not you mastering the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.030
 tools for this procedure is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 You know how to fit it all into your 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.890
 work flow because imagine if you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.220
 is charging a million a book you make 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.829
 all these photo by force treatments 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.140
 It will take ages to give the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.600
 now if this stuff is magazine cover 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.880
 a fashion editorial then you should 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.369
 spend all the time in the world taking care of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.710
 photo by photo then in each class 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.899
 in each segment of photography 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 in each workflow routine in the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.680
 image processing will come from a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.860
 completely different from the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 How do I define this really is not 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
 easy to set this but have a few tips 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.659
 to help for example an idealization 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 you should spend your time 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.430
 proportionally divided into four 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 phases x time to shoot the same x 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.500
 time to select the same time for 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.550
 try the same time to sell then 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.410
 a two-hour plus two- hour trial 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.510
 in the selection and preparation of this 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 material but spent two hours in the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.210
 treatment and two hours spent in the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.950
 sale 8 hours in college a customer is 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.540
 example depending on the segment of the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.460
 class you can not spend more than 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.930
 half an hour to take care of all 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.850
 that client's procedures and 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.580
 depending on the class you can spend 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.310
 week over the same client is that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.960
 This account is not so clear in the head as 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.670
 You can not get an accurate idea 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.100
 How long did it take us to? 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.080
 sell to select to listen to customer 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.000
 in relation to the photos he would like 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.340
 to his album is much more 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 you can count the time of the test and the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.610
 treatment time of the test begins to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.050
 count from the time you went to take 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.970
 shower to leave until the time you 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.470
 arrived back in his office on his 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.270
 home not if the test lasted an hour 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.550
 probably three 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.620
 the treatment time begins after 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.540
 you have already selected organized for example 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.610
 the client and you actually sat down to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 work if you treated all the photos 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.060
 no light on then exported another 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.310
 by photoshop to fix a thing 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.170
 more dramatic it gave three hours three 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.570
 hours is the treatment time but before 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 of treating you spend time 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.170
 selecting discharging riding 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.270
 copy sheet recording everything and cd 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.160
 sending to the client all these 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.550
 aspects make up your workflow 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.950
 and before all this happens you 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.900
 spent time selling it upgraded one 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.420
 website promotion you have created a table 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.760
 or received the call from 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.620
 a customer or you called the customer 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.690
 I just went with him to Pizarro 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.520
 craftsmanship on the tablet is a sign of 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.920
 this time is also included in your 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.560
 use per day is a tip for 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.570
 You do not spend 18 hours doing 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 handling a customer 30 hours 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.610
 making a client's treatment be pew 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.320
 proving the treatment of a client 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.820
 to win rough milan 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.070
 understand that the cheaper your 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.530
 product the less time you can spend 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.570
 trying to understand also that the more 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.880
 Can you solve the photographic scene? 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.220
 The more you can deliver a 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.350
 file is best for your 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.060
 workflow so do not shoot in 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.620
 a dirty wall you're going to have to 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.209
 deal with 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.519
 the mall and then if you want a 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.370
 white background get white background with 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.110
 light background the background do not stay photo by 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.639
 photo bursting the background ending of 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.400
 arrive in white if you want background 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.190
 black smooth work in the shadows does not 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.540
 put a rotten black tnt that after the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.160
 photoshop you'll have to stay 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.400
 resolving that texture in a fair that 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.380
 appears a black background if it does with a good 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.690
 backs and makeup artist even if your 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.479
 product is very cheap the value of 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.880
 Makeup artist will fit in this package will 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.889
 reduce its final cost on account of the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.570
 workflow because if it is 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.520
 well makeup you will not have to stay 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.020
 treating photo by photo in photoshop as 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.030
 photos will come out more roundabout will 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.699
 save a huge amount of time 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.590
 do not click a lot more photos than you 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.570
 you want to present it is cool simple 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.910
 only now in digital technology do you 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.650
 lifting material larger than you 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.260
 want to present this has countless 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.870
 benefits but does not exaggerate in this formula 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.990
 to close a packet of 20 photos you do 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.090
 144 thousand clicks it only remains week only 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.139
 to select these photos there you stay 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.690
 pity 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.720
 one throws the pictures away that lot of 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.100
 photo equal and bad together you have 32 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.900
 Equal photos looks like a stop motion 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.810
 well I think she just what I wanted 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.490
 say liked the tip my lady joinha 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.490
 and for me, sign up for the channel and
