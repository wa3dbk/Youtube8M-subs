adjustable type it has the spring sit in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
adjustable type it has the spring sit in
the<00:00:50.309> factory<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> full<00:00:51.870> kit<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the factory so it's the full kit as you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
the factory so it's the full kit as you
can<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.370> finish<00:00:53.850> looking<00:00:54.120> at

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
can see here so just finish looking at

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
can see here so just finish looking at
this<00:00:54.329> photo<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:55.199> everything<00:00:56.039> needed<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
this photo with everything needed to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.099 
this photo with everything needed to
install<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:59.210> go<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> close<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
install and go to a close up of the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.450 
install and go to a close up of the
valve<00:01:01.530> itself<00:01:02.719> okay<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> valve

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
valve itself okay we go so the valve

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
valve itself okay we go so the valve
unlike<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.330> SUVs<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.260> any<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
unlike the other SUVs or any of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
unlike the other SUVs or any of the
other<00:01:07.680> sq<00:01:08.130> these<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
other sq these does not have the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
other sq these does not have the
adjustable<00:01:09.689> bulk<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> locking<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.920> back

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
adjustable bulk and locking that in back

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
adjustable bulk and locking that in back
here<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> spring<00:01:12.810> has<00:01:13.260> been<00:01:13.500> set<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
here so the spring has been set in the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.719 
here so the spring has been set in the
factory<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.530> apart<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
factory and apart from that it is the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
factory and apart from that it is the
same<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.689> adjustable<00:01:19.259> universal<00:01:19.979> type

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
same as the adjustable universal type

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.899 
same as the adjustable universal type
but<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.299> factory<00:01:21.990> set<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> evil<00:01:23.250> now

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but it is factory set for the evil now

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.100 
but it is factory set for the evil now
it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> diaphragm<00:01:24.570> type<00:01:24.810> there's<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
it's a diaphragm type there's a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's a diaphragm type there's a
diaphragm<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> back<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
diaphragm in the back here and this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
diaphragm in the back here and this
works<00:01:27.869> sequentially<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> pull<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> little

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
works sequentially to pull on a little

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.630 
works sequentially to pull on a little
piston<00:01:30.119> when<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> piston<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> pulled<00:01:31.829> back<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
piston when the piston is pulled back it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.359 
piston when the piston is pulled back it
releases<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:33.960> bursts<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.350> boost<00:01:34.979> through

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
releases little bursts of boost through

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.999 
releases little bursts of boost through
the<00:01:35.490> front<00:01:35.670> trumpet<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:37.290> acting<00:01:37.890> on

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the front trumpet here now acting on

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.990 
the front trumpet here now acting on
this<00:01:38.189> diaphragm<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:40.549> inner<00:01:41.549> manifold

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this diaphragm is the inner manifold

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999 
this diaphragm is the inner manifold
vacuum<00:01:42.090> pulling<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> diaphragm<00:01:43.470> pulling

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
vacuum pulling on the diaphragm pulling

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.039 
vacuum pulling on the diaphragm pulling
it<00:01:44.100> towards<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> left<00:01:45.090> side<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> also

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it towards the left side and also

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.039 
it towards the left side and also
pushing<00:01:46.530> towards<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> left<00:01:47.310> side<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
pushing towards the left side is the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.660 
pushing towards the left side is the
boost<00:01:49.049> pressure<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.740> below<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
boost pressure from below so this is the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
boost pressure from below so this is the
boost<00:01:50.909> pressure<00:01:51.360> comes<00:01:51.750> through<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> flange

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
boost pressure comes through the flange

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.590 
boost pressure comes through the flange
here<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.100> inner<00:01:53.220> manifold<00:01:53.670> vacuum<00:01:53.729> here

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
here and the inner manifold vacuum here

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.660 
here and the inner manifold vacuum here
so<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> combination<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> two<00:01:55.890> pushes

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so in the combination of the two pushes

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.639 
so in the combination of the two pushes
on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> diaphragm<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> resisted<00:01:58.500> by

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
on the diaphragm which is resisted by

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
on the diaphragm which is resisted by
the<00:01:58.710> spring<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> course<00:01:59.700> in<00:02:00.240> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the spring which of course in this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.859 
the spring which of course in this
instance<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.200> set<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.030> factory<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
instance is set in the factory and that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.399 
instance is set in the factory and that
pulls<00:02:04.140> back<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.610> piston<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.930> which

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pulls back on the piston here which

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.729 
pulls back on the piston here which
releases<00:02:07.799> sequential<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.700> bursts<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.739> the
