00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.460
 yes 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.200
 how have you lived? I saw in a bag like 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.580
 A Little bit weird 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.940
 Thoughtful 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.950
 thoughtful that you think you can know 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.110
 in the future I feel like I want to start 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.669
 do what I want 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.670
 good 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.210
 in that we are dealing with what 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.409
 we are what we are living 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.750
 cheever problems that I feel that I already 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.280
 I enjoy some things but you're 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.280
 speaking in our church alagÃ³n 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.030
 last year I left motocross for me 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.030
 career 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.300
 and I do not regret 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.910
 but I feel that what made me happy in 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.120
 that right now called tequila 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 loyal 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.260
 I've been thinking a lot 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.550
 and after the presentation of me I 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.970
 usually leave the study 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.970
 Y 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.659
 leave the study of those who speak 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.609
 of the lion is the best 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.140
 stops to spend an artist you 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.999
 it seems the best seems to me the best 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.550
 because I want to focus 100% with the 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.440
 Lady 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.690
 if it were not what I am, I would never have 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.660
 come to where you are do not forget to 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.010
 that and I appreciate it is fine but no longer 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.940
 I want to waste time 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.350
 if you're wasting time the moment 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.350
 I know that it was very hard for you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.700
 band and avasallan is not only that has 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.360
 to do with that I do not feel comfortable 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.280
 here 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 all right 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.930
 I do not understand I do not have to because nobody 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.340
 they are not like you want, it seems to me 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.500
 you're making a big mistake 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.270
 right now I feel like this is my life and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.780
 they are my decisions I am also part 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.640
 of your life lion 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.220
 with time because you put yourself like that because if 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.970
 you look for the study that decision too 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 it has to do with me
