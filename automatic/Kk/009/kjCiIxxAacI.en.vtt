00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.300
 The nine most common design errors 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.940
 Web 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.470
 There are many errors in the 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.450
 different websites 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.030
 sometimes caused by simple carelessness 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.190
 but a good starting point is to know 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.650
 what are the nine most common mistakes 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.050
 of web design 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.660
 the first mistake is to have very pages 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.820
 saturated the negative spaces is 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.610
 say areas in components that do not 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.070
 are part of the web design background are 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.379
 a very important element that affects the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.180
 way these visitors perceive 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.780
 the importance of the other elements of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.100
 the page include web design just for 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.260
 information related to 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.839
 navigation of your site and the elements 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.400
 of each page since usually the 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.890
 visitors look for specific information 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.410
 the second mistake is not to contribute new 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.080
 contained unless your design is 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.750
 completely static the new monster 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.670
 information and content is vital for a 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.830
 good web design since when your 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.740
 returning visitors want to see what has 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.600
 changed since his last visit the use 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.550
 of blogs allows these changes 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.560
 automatically with messages that 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.909
 listed in descending order according to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.640
 date of publication 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.579
 the third error is inserting into sets 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.009
 difficult to locate the links are 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.380
 one of the most important components and 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.329
 you must make sure that the links in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.020
 your website are easy to distinguish 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.329
 among the other elements of the text 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.859
 highlighting them as a different color 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.040
 underlined or any other attribute of 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.350
 text 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.150
 the fourth mistake is not to use the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.640
 appropriate format for the different 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.160
 web design images of your site and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.020
 that using the wrong format can 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.390
 make your image files are 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.080
 larger than necessary or can 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.960
 affect the quality of the final image 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.600
 the fifth mistake is not to name 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.240
 the different pages per website the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.940
 default name of a page is a 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.670
 tyson document and this term in a 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.460
 Google search can reach up to 30 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.800
 millions of results give each 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.230
 page a unique name that has 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.750
 direct relationship with the content is a 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.370
 great help with seo so much for a good 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.620
 positioning in the results of 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.300
 search as to offer them results 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.300
 relevant to potential visitors 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.940
 the sixth mistake is offering a navigation 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.390
 unfriendly for visitors so much 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.560
 in terms of location as of use 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.050
 there was a tendency to hide the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.090
 navigation integrating it perfectly 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.130
 in the images or other content of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.040
 the main page and although 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.819
 artistically it was interesting 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.579
 functionally it was very hostile 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.760
 the seventh mistake is to have a purpose 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.730
 uncertain web design should allow you 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.329
 the visitor immediately recognize in 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.049
 what kind of website is there 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.480
 regardless of the page in the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.219
 that lands in the first seconds 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.129
 after accessing a page 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 determined mushroom the names of the 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.409
 Similar pages or indications should 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.920
 make it obvious to the user where 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.740
 is found 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.860
 the eighth mistake is to use strong colors 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.870
 especially the contrasting ones since 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.080
 they can quickly make your site 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.930
 web is difficult to see eye fatigue 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.390
 is a determining factor for the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.340
 most people leave and a 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.380
 Good design should show the content of 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.380
 a website and avoid any element 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.080
 that distracts the user 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.810
 the last mistake is to mix the advertising 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.670
 with the content of the web design with the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.860
 banner ads is relatively 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.140
 easy since most of the users 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.720
 of the internet know this type of 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.330
 ads but it's a bit more complicated 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.860
 with inserted text links 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.170
 advertising with meaning for their 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.300
 visitors and make sure that these 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.330
 links differ from your links 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.340
 of text 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.290
 if this information has been useful 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.379
