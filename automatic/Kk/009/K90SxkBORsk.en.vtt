00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello dear friends Swami channel 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 artichoke and today I launch a new 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.599
 heading called harmful weapon where 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 I will show in each video by 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.710
 one of the weapons that interest you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.109
 for this, I arrange special 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.890
 poll of his group which every three 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.590
 of the day we choose 1-3 weapons of today 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.869
 the survey took part for the sake of elder 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 provocateur and of course the desert eagle 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.439
 what do you think who won wonders 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.439
 go 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.379
 I think many have already won 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.479
 such a weapon is not a simple gun 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.640
 gun pistol possessing special 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:54.260
 characteristics called deserted 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.539
 eagle this gun has ammo 720 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.059
 their long-range us 5 stars 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.640
 4 star damage I think it's not easy 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.500
 named after 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.860
 desert eagle because the eagle is one 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.009
 of the most powerful birds that live on 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.420
 earth and this is one of the most 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.940
 powerful pistols 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 which can now be bought in contra 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.319
 City 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.179
 you say what he did you ask what 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.330
 he is remarkable besides his 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.020
 characteristics besides the characteristic he 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.600
 still 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.380
 notable for its appearance as 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.500
 see he is not just a beautiful gun 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.619
 such as in excess of the demob politruk or 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.129
 retainer he is even more beautiful look at 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.310
 its design it all glitters is quite simply 

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:49.039
 This is a new type of weapon. This is a new design and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.860
 it also distinguishes it from other species 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.450
 pistols looking at him and 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.519
 look at the other gun and you immediately 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.720
 understand what you pay 2000 g. 

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:02.000
 understanding 2000 kb 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.190
 this is to dig it up a lot 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 time and to donate it to us to invest 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.310
 100 votes 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.050
 but it's worth it believe me for a long time not 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.590
 I wanted to buy it I thought it was all 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.239
 bullshit but that moment frame you play anyone 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.310
 go for the garden and you just 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.319
 run out of ammo and you need 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.240
 just finish something off the opponent 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.210
 let's say 100 hp 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.600
 then questions shot him in the head and he 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.710
 lies dead here and so of course 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.810
 I understand that this type of gun for those 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.460
 people whose hands grow from 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.050
 right place because with it 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.970
 shoot hard especially hit crit 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.890
 there is also a workshop 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.380
 You can also pump desert eagle 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.960
 what gives a desert eagle when he 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.550
 pumped over workshop for 15k b 1 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.510
 increased damage on medium and far 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.760
 distances 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.590
 the second increases the speed of movement and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 increases total ammo 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.710
 what about increased damage kretov 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.760
 stage long distance I would not say 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.510
 because on medium and far 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.340
 distances he is also 2 like the others 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 moods on average are still less than 1 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.060
 long distances takes only 20-25 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.900
 in the near to the nearest station on the middle 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.680
 head distance can shoot up to 97 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.160
 I already play with him about a month and 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.000
 damn all the time only finish 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.680
 a pistol because why waste 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.610
 cartridges on the machine when there is a powerful 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.480
 a gun a blow to the head i can kill 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.140
 any Donat and damn two shots I 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.540
 I can fill up 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.490
 Full Fula course to groove 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.510
 try to fill up the full fula 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.640
 which shoots you say well ambush 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.520
 you shoot a gun and it will be hard 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.930
 need to move quickly and get him 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.060
 I don't know what else to say 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.020
 apart from that you just look at 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.270
 look at his characteristics 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.750
 save money and buy and because he 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.320
 worth it a hundred percent of that 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.120
 it's worth it because it's a gun 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.440
 which has never been in contra 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.330
 the city is so powerful 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.009
 good beautiful gun well 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.199
 damn i just have no words let's 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.000
 check out his special combat 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.469
 characteristics already in the game 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.449
 and if I find something else, then I will show you 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:45.180
 I will tell you again and again 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:48.069
 let's get into the game and go 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:05:03.699
 see and even movement is normal with 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:05:43.509
 but it is not too slow all opashku 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:47.919
 take their own in the forest but in short you understand 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:50.110
 that this weapon is in principle with him the color is not 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.969
 especially possible but if only on 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.400
 pistols you know who else okay 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:06:04.839
 As a tool for finishing off, it's just 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:09.569
 the best weapon besides siberica of course well 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:12.699
 Of course, if not Siberian jerk off then damn 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:18.699
 the desert eagle gun will be the 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:21.099
 the best dodi and look at its design 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:29.099
 damn not design pins the most 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:29.099
 and ran somewhere 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:45.410
 nowhere are you right now to him 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.410
 I want to put did not fill up 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:07:02.400
 let's try again 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:07:04.380
 But I see porridge just need a pancake 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.409
 have straight arms and of course this is not 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.319
