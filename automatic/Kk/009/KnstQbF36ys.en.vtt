00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
especially with the position he plays

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.910 
especially with the position he plays
and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> defense<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.350> inform

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
but their positioning is absolutely

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
but their positioning is absolutely
phenomenal<00:02:03.270> guys<00:02:03.780> they're<00:02:04.710> always<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.009> the
