00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.240
 until the 20 years ago diet that was something of people 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.629
 cut very fat 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.510
 today until the others and until 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.740
 and there's the question of what's going on with modern food 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 and do it again 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.880
 until 20 years ago 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.479
 diet was a matter of short people 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.320
 very good 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 today 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830
 even dog does and the land 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.780
 and there's the question of what's going on with modern food 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 she has more 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.470
 It is clear that the cadence militias 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.050
 although I 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.420
 I enjoyed both wool pokot elba room were peaceful centralized in the pond 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.160
 dirty katyusha na krona 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.770
 It's very cold, yes, because there seems to be no more people need to stay. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 very polluted 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.900
 the average calorie intake I expect to remain weak 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.970
 in the area of ​​his faithful balance does not stop climbing 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.040
 it seems that the older we do 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 the more difficult it is 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.660
 the average calorie intake says to have almost there 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.619
 but the scalesman 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.930
 efe keeps climbing 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.660
 it seems that the more essential 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.709
 the harder it gets stuck and not aggressive 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.040
 something is wrong 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.379
 still in this math 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.909
 and something tells me 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.939
 what stars had been in a lot to do with it 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.319
 sound 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.189
 and it rains 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.619
 the Internet 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.929
 the average consumption of waiting calories may 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.669
 but the scalesman does not stop climbing 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.150
 it seems that the more direct it becomes 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.059
 the hardest is stuck in Greece 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.400
 calculating 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.229
 there was in this mathematics 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.699
 and something tells me 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.390
 that you brokers 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.390
 It has a lot to do with it. 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.669
 that 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.669
 right 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.379
 I'm going to enter 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.359
 I'm going to join that 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.849
 truth 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849
 if you were amazed by these names 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.899
 2 3 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:42.120
 if you were amazed by these names 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.269
 Expect to miss the rest of the study 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.010
 the researchers do not want to know anything about this and here 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.739
 authors also pointed to another problem 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.089
 the continuous injection 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.439
 there are people who just can not stop eating 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.559
 and at any time of the day is always just to give more time to the secret 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.789
 pinch of some salgadinho 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.290
 at the end of the day 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.379
 consumption of this person can easily 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.769
 three times the daily need for caloric intake 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.120
 what's up 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 then it gets ugly 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.819
 but he plays 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.490
 only that 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.210
 now 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.860
 do not not want to leave say 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 this will live one for obesity 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 and that the cities themselves 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.410
 Italy, too, wants to
