this<00:00:49.230> video<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> had<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> really<00:00:50.219> cool<00:00:50.520> idea

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this video so I had a really cool idea

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
this video so I had a really cool idea
that<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.270> could<00:00:51.300> customize<00:00:52.079> our<00:00:52.199> own<00:00:52.350> weapons

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that we could customize our own weapons

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
that we could customize our own weapons
in<00:00:52.920> red<00:00:53.129> dead<00:00:53.309> redemption<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.780> grass

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
in red dead redemption because in grass

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.170 
in red dead redemption because in grass
after<00:00:55.260> five<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.039> were<00:00:56.219> able<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.579> customize

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
after five we were able to customize

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
after five we were able to customize
around<00:00:57.899> weapons<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> means<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.160> could

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
around weapons and that means we could

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.930 
around weapons and that means we could
add<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.609> silencers<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.840> some<00:01:01.050> scopes<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
add some silencers get some scopes and

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.810 
add some silencers get some scopes and
also<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.470> ability<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.700> know

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
also there was a the ability of you know

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
also there was a the ability of you know
getting<00:01:06.000> extended<00:01:06.570> mags<00:01:06.869> etc<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.010> could

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
getting extended mags etc and I could

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.350 
getting extended mags etc and I could
have<00:01:08.460> thought<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.060> cool

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
have thought that was pretty cool

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
have thought that was pretty cool
because<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.200> never<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.560> any<00:01:10.680> other<00:01:10.890> Grand

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because it was never in any other Grand

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
because it was never in any other Grand
Theft<00:01:11.340> Auto<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.170> big

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
Theft Auto and I think it's a really big

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
Theft Auto and I think it's a really big
step<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.740> from<00:01:14.220> previous<00:01:15.030> grand<00:01:15.270> theft<00:01:15.450> autos

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
step up from previous grand theft autos

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.200 
step up from previous grand theft autos
and<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:17.100> most<00:01:17.430> weapons<00:01:17.670> were<00:01:18.000> just

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and that because most weapons were just

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.810 
and that because most weapons were just
default<00:01:18.659> weapons<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.250> were<00:01:20.400> given

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
default weapons and if not we were given

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
default weapons and if not we were given
say<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.720> example<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.170> silencer<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
say for example a silencer with that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.649 
say for example a silencer with that
weapon<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:23.759> was<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.060> options<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
weapon so there was no options of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350 
weapon so there was no options of
customizing<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> weapons<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> ur<00:01:25.890> Lycans<00:01:26.640> now

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
customizing the weapons to ur Lycans now

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.149 
customizing the weapons to ur Lycans now
i<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.630> believe<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.229> red<00:01:28.380> dead<00:01:28.409> redemption<00:01:28.680> we

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
i do believe for red dead redemption we

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
i do believe for red dead redemption we
will<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> option<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.210> customers<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.720> our

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
will have the option of customers in our

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.170 
will have the option of customers in our
own<00:01:31.200> weapons<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.799> kinda<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.460> rockstar<00:01:32.939> going

to<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.770> take<00:01:35.100> ideas

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to do that because they will take ideas

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.390 
to do that because they will take ideas
from<00:01:35.520> grand<00:01:35.939> theft<00:01:36.060> auto<00:01:36.270> 5<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:37.590> necessarily

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
from grand theft auto 5 not necessarily

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.090 
from grand theft auto 5 not necessarily
with<00:01:38.670> ideas<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.509> maybe<00:01:39.829> let's<00:01:40.829> say<00:01:40.890> for

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
with ideas of like maybe let's say for

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
with ideas of like maybe let's say for
example<00:01:41.130> maybe<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> map<00:01:41.970> maybe<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.540> map<00:01:42.689> will

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
example maybe the map maybe the map will

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810 
example maybe the map maybe the map will
be<00:01:42.990> completely<00:01:43.500> different<00:01:44.040> obviously<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
be completely different obviously the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
be completely different obviously the
map<00:01:44.970> will<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.500> possibly<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.770> ways<00:01:46.950> similar

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
map will be possibly some ways similar

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.550 
map will be possibly some ways similar
to<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> first<00:01:47.880> red<00:01:48.090> dead<00:01:48.240> redemption<00:01:48.390> boy<00:01:48.930> but

to the first red dead redemption boy but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
to the first red dead redemption boy but
the<00:01:49.649> map<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.159> more<00:01:50.399> expanded<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the map will be more expanded and

the map will be more expanded and
