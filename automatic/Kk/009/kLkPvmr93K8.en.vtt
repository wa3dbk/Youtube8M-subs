00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
just show you how I got it set it up do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
just show you how I got it set it up do
this<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.300> quickly<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.250> three

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this one quickly and I have three

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.600 
this one quickly and I have three
gestures<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.360> left<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.410> motion

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
gestures here left and right motion

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:05.719 
gestures here left and right motion
which<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.789> use<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:58.140> control<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:05.400> got<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
which I use to control and I've got the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.690 
which I use to control and I've got the
up-and-down<00:01:06.270> motion<00:01:06.890> here<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.610> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
up-and-down motion here and there you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
up-and-down motion here and there you
know<00:01:08.760> motion<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> down<00:01:10.920> motion<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
know motion the up and down motion is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.010 
know motion the up and down motion is
what<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> control<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:13.490> 73<00:01:14.490> calls

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
what I use to control what 73 calls

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
what I use to control what 73 calls
force<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> force<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:20.250> amount<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.759> force

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
force the force is the amount of force

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.719 
force the force is the amount of force
you<00:01:21.299> apply<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.869> both<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> strings

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you apply to the both on the strings

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
you apply to the both on the strings
which<00:01:24.570> gets<00:01:24.869> fabulous<00:01:25.860> results<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:28.259> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
which gets fabulous results and the in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
which gets fabulous results and the in
and<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.890> motion<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> backwards<00:01:30.570> yeah<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and out motion for the backwards yeah I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.090 
and out motion for the backwards yeah I
used<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> control<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.430> vibrato<00:01:33.060> amount<00:01:34.100> so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
used to control the vibrato amount so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
used to control the vibrato amount so
let<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.790> demonstrate<00:01:36.180> how<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
let me just demonstrate how all of this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
let me just demonstrate how all of this
works<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.150> that's<00:01:39.150> right

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
works so that's right

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
works so that's right
now<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.380> instrument<00:01:40.799> doesn't<00:01:41.280> output<00:01:41.880> any

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
now this instrument doesn't output any

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.899 
now this instrument doesn't output any
sound<00:01:42.450> until<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.290> hold<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.649> note<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.549> move<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
sound until you hold a note and move the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
sound until you hold a note and move the
bow<00:01:46.729> very<00:01:47.729> logical<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.439> go

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
bow very logical so here we go

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.590 
bow very logical so here we go
left<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:51.030> basic<00:01:51.689> motions

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
left and right basic motions

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:37.660 
left and right basic motions

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
oh now notice how I utilize the vibrato

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.930 
oh now notice how I utilize the vibrato
and<00:02:41.720> strong<00:02:42.700> passages<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:44.170> low<00:02:45.170> notes

probably<00:03:38.400> sound<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.940> lavish<00:03:39.510> string

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
probably sound like a lavish string

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.390 
probably sound like a lavish string
player<00:03:40.080> but<00:03:40.319> it's<00:03:40.560> only<00:03:40.709> because<00:03:40.860> this

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
player but it's only because this

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.850 
player but it's only because this
technique<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.150> new<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.630> me<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.620> really

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
technique is new to me and I really

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.050 
technique is new to me and I really
understand<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.970> helps<00:03:45.450> me<00:03:45.540> understand<00:03:46.110> how

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
now watch this when I play low I get

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.710 
now watch this when I play low I get
more<00:04:10.410> harmonics<00:04:10.980> because<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.610> bow<00:04:11.790> applies

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
more harmonics because the bow applies

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:31.130 
more harmonics because the bow applies
less<00:04:12.959> pressure<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.680> strings<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.960> more

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
less pressure on the strings the more

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.370

to<00:04:43.919> my<00:04:44.820> emotions

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
to my emotions

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.440

thanks to the leap motion controller and

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.380 
thanks to the leap motion controller and
gecko<00:04:48.450> meeting<00:04:48.750> it's<00:04:49.440> just<00:04:50.220> more<00:04:50.970> playable

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390

and I guess the future is really going

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.600 
and I guess the future is really going
in<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.360> direction<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:58.190> physically<00:04:59.190> modeled

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
in the direction of physically modeled

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.580 
in the direction of physically modeled
