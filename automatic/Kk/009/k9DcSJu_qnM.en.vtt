to<00:01:23.009> say<00:01:23.130> there's<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.240> it's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to say there's not really I think it's

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.149 
to say there's not really I think it's
pretty<00:01:24.690> accurate<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
pretty accurate really like the way the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190

relic<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.640> come<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.750> might<00:01:28.140> be

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
relic has come up I think this might be

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
relic has come up I think this might be
a<00:01:28.290> few<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.740> bits<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.100> pieces<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a few little bits and pieces here and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.600 
a few little bits and pieces here and
there<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.630> I'll<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.899> look<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.259> but

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
there that then I'll have a look at but

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:50.340 
there that then I'll have a look at but
you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:32.970> pretty<00:01:33.060> much<00:01:33.180> done
