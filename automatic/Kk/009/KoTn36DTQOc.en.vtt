00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.790

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 chile also took the cnc who took it off says that you have to write good 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060
 I believe that my novel about techniques that covers what is happening 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
 indicates that the court hiring the consultation consultation 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.549
 that this simple 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.990
 I terrible and pathetic 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.089
 p on the other hand there is nothing to regret na-dyn-tÃ©lam class x it is and sends to 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.880
 what not do not do not - lima new imac different given that 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.690
 We have always known the opinion as frying 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.840
 and the alliance we've talked absolutely nothing to the last 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.359
 I asked that year 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.559
 and on the other hand, off-hook data from the consultation if the agreement 

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.650
 to give an answer to this 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 enormous emptiness and boredom in which we live p il mm that radiates same tomorrow 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.400
 Attention teams will use in mind 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.280
 in a carrycot more thing than now 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 but we are not able to account for that change that has made it that has 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.820
 happened since rafael gumucio is going on when named frame 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 enrÃ­quez-ominami candidates for president por ciento 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.890
 It was a wonderful thing in two battles to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 will have to do it not in the oea 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.030
 jl depends on the program but I like it here because I think it's a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 ali that cool that changes 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.990
 p 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.170
 read it and a little and I think that the campaign that has made the stage 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.790
 and the social and they take you against him 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 it's really shameful and brand new 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 is programmed from the state of total decay of the conglomerate 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.809
 politician 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.189
 they are rather a voter and logical I am going to vote for the one that represents my 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.459
 and my idea is that they are social-democratic mulberry 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.139
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.799
 and it's very safe to try that I'm mayor of the concertation after the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.899
 back and vote for him I like it or not like his opera 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:33.179
 by his wife or his new author opts for my idea 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.789
 but it seems to me that the framework of a 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.659
 a lagun hoop that the club that you have to hear and how refreshing 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.159
 that abc out and everything smart and capable 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.840
 and what the issue is that with the only company that they have given the luxury of 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:52.219
 to waste a human capital that does not spare me it seems 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.149
 pathetic and plant
