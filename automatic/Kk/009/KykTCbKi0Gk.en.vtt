00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.690
 I will teach you how to manufacture 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.509
 isolate me also called mount for that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.950
 you take tissue you have to take 18 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460
 who's not going too sweetest unit not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.359
 long months I took fleece fabric from 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.359
 so cut off the camp of the great mute 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 so when you 've cut some jeans 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.260
 cut a second of the same shape 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.690
 so that's getting two wheels with the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.930
 fabric of your choice then then 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.930
 superimpose the circles 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 take a needle 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 then we must take the lead 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.439
 so you see a little bit of 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.439
 china you make a tree 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.300
 here you go the film in the eil 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.909
 and once it's done it'll have to 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.909
 sew the two pieces are 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.110
 so I did not film any passages where 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.230
 was just now it would have been 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.030
 good it's very repetitive so once 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.209
 that you have sewn you have to leave a 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.209
 little place without sewing so get there 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:08.110
 party to neu so so I fortified bonnet 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.110
 after 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.310
 so from there it would not be very 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.129
 aesthetic to leave him like that so 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.879
 we must return so that the seams 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.879
 on found in 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:33.790
 so we go back and so we get the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.970
 dozen like that so after you take 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.400
 cotton wadding end a material that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.400
 will be soft and fits easily 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.010
 so here's after I balance 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:58.620
 so learned will have to sew this 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.620
 part there to close the muzelle 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:12.090
 so like it's going to be the same 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:12.090
 principle one understands a wire and mobiles 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.850
 and we will run to close long 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.360
 so we could have left others more 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.590
 small if you were less 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.590
 visible later 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.719
 so that's the end of the Muslim so 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.429
 it's not very straight but it allows 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.459
 still protect the horse 

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:14.389
 is to have one still cheaper 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:14.389
 that can be found in commerce
