00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
can use that is basically thinking about

can use that is basically thinking about
that<00:00:43.430> or<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.730> can<00:00:43.910> repel<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.480> that<00:00:44.750> thought

that or we can repel that that thought
that<00:00:45.320> problem<00:00:45.740> is<00:00:45.890> thinking<00:00:46.580> about<00:00:46.820> that

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
that problem is thinking about that

problem before it presents the issue and
that's<00:00:50.180> basically<00:00:50.600> can<00:00:50.840> be<00:00:50.990> alleviated<00:00:51.170> by

and what I mean by hanging the bait is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.520 
and what I mean by hanging the bait is
what<00:02:24.799> you<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.189> is<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.659> you<00:02:26.870> set<00:02:27.139> the<00:02:27.290> bait

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
what you do is you have you set the bait

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.489 
what you do is you have you set the bait
put<00:02:28.189> your<00:02:28.340> bait<00:02:28.489> in<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:28.819> bucket<00:02:29.030> on<00:02:29.959> set<00:02:30.379> it

put your bait in your bucket on set it
on<00:02:30.590> any<00:02:31.129> type<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.459> wood<00:02:32.560> firewood<00:02:33.560> block<00:02:33.829> or<00:02:34.069> a

cinder block or anything like that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.809 
cinder block or anything like that
the<00:02:36.349> idea<00:02:36.680> being<00:02:36.889> that<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.280> deer<00:02:37.489> whenever

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
the idea being that the deer whenever

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.309 
the idea being that the deer whenever
they<00:02:37.909> come<00:02:38.150> in<00:02:38.329> they're<00:02:38.450> not<00:02:38.480> destructive<00:02:39.200> in

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
they come in they're not destructive in

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.050 
they come in they're not destructive in
their<00:02:39.439> feeding<00:02:39.650> habits<00:02:40.069> typically<00:02:40.579> so<00:02:40.849> what

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
their feeding habits typically so what

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.670 
their feeding habits typically so what
the<00:02:41.180> idea<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.569> if<00:02:41.989> they'll<00:02:42.170> pick<00:02:42.349> up<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.590> little

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
the idea is if they'll pick up a little

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.440 
the idea is if they'll pick up a little
bit<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.980> your<00:02:43.099> feed<00:02:43.340> your<00:02:43.790> bait<00:02:43.969> before<00:02:44.209> they

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
bit of your feed your bait before they

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.239 
bit of your feed your bait before they
get<00:02:44.629> there<00:02:44.930> they<00:02:45.349> can<00:02:45.560> pick<00:02:45.709> up<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:45.919> little<00:02:46.040> bit

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:46.249 
get there they can pick up a little bit

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.580 
get there they can pick up a little bit
out<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.400> your<00:02:46.609> your<00:02:46.969> up<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.419> bucket<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.959> exit

out of your your up your bucket and exit

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.559 
out of your your up your bucket and exit
the<00:02:48.709> trap<00:02:48.980> without<00:02:49.159> tripping<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.819> string<00:02:50.120> all

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
birds and the reason for that on birds

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.159 
birds and the reason for that on birds
whenever<00:03:16.909> they<00:03:17.030> set<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:17.419> your<00:03:17.540> trip<00:03:17.810> string

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
whenever they set on your trip string

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.140 
whenever they set on your trip string
and<00:03:18.409> the<00:03:19.099> other<00:03:19.250> design<00:03:19.669> will<00:03:19.849> show<00:03:20.090> you

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and the other design will show you

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.089 
and the other design will show you
they'll<00:03:20.989> set<00:03:21.229> on<00:03:21.349> your<00:03:21.439> trip<00:03:21.650> string<00:03:21.949> and

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
they'll set on your trip string and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.899 
they'll set on your trip string and
collapse<00:03:22.370> your<00:03:22.549> board

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
collapse your board

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.550 
collapse your board
whereas<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.479> they<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.930> set<00:03:24.109> on<00:03:24.229> this<00:03:24.290> trip

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
whereas this they can set on this trip

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.229 
whereas this they can set on this trip
string<00:03:24.799> all<00:03:25.009> day<00:03:25.220> long<00:03:25.459> your<00:03:25.699> trigger<00:03:25.909> string

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
string all day long your trigger string

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.999 
string all day long your trigger string
and<00:03:26.659> it<00:03:26.780> just<00:03:26.989> forces<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.590> triggering

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009 
and it just forces the triggering

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.399 
and it just forces the triggering
mechanism<00:03:28.609> even<00:03:28.729> even<00:03:29.299> more<00:03:29.479> firm<00:03:29.720> into<00:03:30.319> the

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
mechanism even even more firm into the

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.649 
mechanism even even more firm into the
gate<00:03:30.590> but<00:03:31.549> this<00:03:31.699> is<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.000> design<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.359> we'll

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
gate but this is the design that we'll

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.210 
gate but this is the design that we'll
use<00:03:32.689> whenever<00:03:33.139> we<00:03:33.319> have<00:03:33.470> deer<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.040> main

use whenever we have deer is the main

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.569 
use whenever we have deer is the main
non<00:03:34.489> target<00:03:35.169> that<00:03:36.169> we<00:03:36.290> want<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.650> avoid<00:03:37.099> and

non target that we want to avoid and

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.909 
non target that we want to avoid and
we'll<00:03:37.790> use<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.180> extra<00:03:38.810> line<00:03:38.989> post<00:03:39.349> across<00:03:39.739> the

we'll use the extra line post across the

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.860 
we'll use the extra line post across the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
problem in our trapping set so what this

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.770 
problem in our trapping set so what this
basically<00:04:06.229> is<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.979> just<00:04:07.219> a<00:04:07.370> trick<00:04:07.639> string<00:04:08.000> and

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
basically is is just a trick string and

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.950 
basically is is just a trick string and
your<00:04:08.930> truck<00:04:09.199> strength

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
your truck strength

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.750 
your truck strength
we'll<00:04:11.960> go<00:04:12.110> across<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.800> more<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.340> first<00:04:13.490> thing

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
we'll go across it more the first thing

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.190 
we'll go across it more the first thing
you<00:04:13.850> want<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.060> do<00:04:14.210> is<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.780> want<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:14.990> put<00:04:15.080> your

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
you want to do is you want to put your

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.630 
you want to do is you want to put your
trip<00:04:15.410> string<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.800> forward<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.250> back<00:04:16.430> of

trip string is forward to the back of
the<00:04:16.700> trap<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.240> can

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
the trap as you can

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.930 
the trap as you can
now<00:04:18.170> what<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.530> trip<00:04:18.770> string<00:04:19.040> will<00:04:19.250> do<00:04:19.460> is

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
now what this trip string will do is

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.550 
now what this trip string will do is
this<00:04:20.240> trip<00:04:20.510> string<00:04:20.720> will<00:04:20.870> allow<00:04:21.050> you<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.290> set

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
this trip string will allow you to set

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.960 
this trip string will allow you to set
the<00:04:21.680> string<00:04:21.950> above<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.460> height<00:04:22.670> of<00:04:22.880> the

the string above the height of the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.120 
the string above the height of the
non-target<00:04:23.660> species<00:04:23.870> where<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.320> raccoons

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
non-target species where the raccoons

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.830 
non-target species where the raccoons
they<00:04:25.310> will<00:04:25.400> pass<00:04:25.580> them<00:04:25.820> anything<00:04:26.360> like<00:04:26.660> then

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
they will pass them anything like then

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.960 
they will pass them anything like then
it<00:04:27.050> could<00:04:27.200> even<00:04:27.410> be<00:04:27.530> piglets<00:04:27.980> we're<00:04:28.700> whatever

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
it could even be piglets we're whatever

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.270 
it could even be piglets we're whatever
feral<00:04:29.420> hogs<00:04:29.600> feed<00:04:30.170> most<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.980> time<00:04:31.160> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
feral hogs feed most of the time the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.560 
feral hogs feed most of the time the
piglets<00:04:31.670> whenever<00:04:31.940> there's<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.180> readily

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
piglets whenever there's a readily

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.330 
piglets whenever there's a readily
available<00:04:33.020> food<00:04:33.620> source<00:04:33.950> they're<00:04:34.130> going<00:04:34.250> to

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
available food source they're going to

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.470 
available food source they're going to
be<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.490> first<00:04:34.670> one<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.030> feed

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
be the first one to the feed

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.210 
be the first one to the feed
so<00:04:35.780> whenever<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.410> piglets<00:04:36.740> come<00:04:36.920> in<00:04:37.040> they<00:04:37.160> can

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
so whenever the piglets come in they can

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.070 
so whenever the piglets come in they can
stay<00:04:37.520> under<00:04:37.850> while<00:04:38.240> you're<00:04:38.450> more<00:04:38.600> trap<00:04:38.870> shy

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
stay under while you're more trap shy

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.080 
stay under while you're more trap shy
individuals<00:04:39.740> being<00:04:39.950> on<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.280> outside<00:04:40.730> have

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
individuals being on the outside have

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.480 
individuals being on the outside have
the<00:04:41.210> time<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.570> work<00:04:41.720> their<00:04:41.930> way<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.350> what<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.370> is

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
the time to work their way in what it is

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.340 
the time to work their way in what it is
basically<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.180> it's<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.660> trip<00:04:44.930> string<00:04:45.200> that

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
basically is it's a trip string that

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.630 
basically is it's a trip string that
whenever<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.800> legs<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.190> their<00:04:46.280> animal

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
whenever the legs of their animal

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.300 
whenever the legs of their animal
collapses<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.240> board<00:04:48.130> trips<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.280> trigger

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
collapses the board trips the trigger

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.970 
collapses the board trips the trigger
now<00:04:50.180> one<00:04:50.900> thing<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.170> was<00:04:51.500> this<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
now one thing that was this is the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.680 
now one thing that was this is the
reason<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:52.400> obviously<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:53.180> reason<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.570> we

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
reason we obviously the reason that we

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.750 
reason we obviously the reason that we
do<00:04:53.900> not<00:04:54.050> use<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.530> trigger<00:04:54.860> whenever<00:04:55.430> we<00:04:55.610> have

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
do not use this trigger whenever we have

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.550 
do not use this trigger whenever we have
deer<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.180> problem<00:04:56.630> is<00:04:56.750> deer<00:04:56.990> will<00:04:57.200> trip<00:04:57.470> the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
deer is a problem is deer will trip the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.110 
deer is a problem is deer will trip the
trigger<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:58.190> like<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.490> rack<00:04:58.700> here<00:04:58.910> just

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
trigger just like the rack here just

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.110 
trigger just like the rack here just
like<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.480> the<00:05:00.290> feral<00:05:00.590> hogs<00:05:00.800> will<00:05:01.070> so<00:05:01.940> that's

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
like the the feral hogs will so that's

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.030 
like the the feral hogs will so that's
why<00:05:02.240> we<00:05:02.390> don't<00:05:02.570> use<00:05:02.750> this<00:05:02.960> another<00:05:03.560> issue<00:05:03.800> on

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
why we don't use this another issue on

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.950 
why we don't use this another issue on
this<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:04.490> is<00:05:04.610> this<00:05:04.730> break<00:05:05.030> board<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.810> we

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
this one is this break board that we

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.230 
this one is this break board that we
have<00:05:06.230> right<00:05:07.100> here<00:05:07.130> it's<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.790> board<00:05:08.090> that's

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
have right here it's just a board that's

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.060 
have right here it's just a board that's
hinged<00:05:08.660> in<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.840> middle<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.890> whatever

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
hinged in the middle is that whatever

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.460 
hinged in the middle is that whatever
birds<00:05:10.550> land<00:05:10.970> on<00:05:11.210> this<00:05:11.420> string<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:12.320> will

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
birds land on this string it will

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.600 
birds land on this string it will
collapse<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:13.040> board

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
collapse that board

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.490 
collapse that board
so<00:05:13.940> if<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.240> have<00:05:14.360> birds<00:05:14.630> as<00:05:14.840> an<00:05:14.990> issue<00:05:15.110> the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
so if you have birds as an issue the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.170 
so if you have birds as an issue the
other<00:05:15.680> type<00:05:15.980> of<00:05:16.010> triggering<00:05:16.580> mechanism<00:05:17.090> in

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
other type of triggering mechanism in

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.570 
other type of triggering mechanism in
the<00:05:17.240> front<00:05:17.480> maybe<00:05:17.570> what<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:17.930> want<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.140> look<00:05:18.260> at

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
the front maybe what you want to look at

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.650 
the front maybe what you want to look at
another<00:05:19.580> issue<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.060> we<00:05:20.210> need<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.450> think

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
another issue that we need to think

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.530 
another issue that we need to think
about<00:05:20.780> is<00:05:21.140> on<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.410> trip<00:05:21.650> string<00:05:22.010> itself<00:05:22.540> the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
about is on the trip string itself the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.090 
about is on the trip string itself the
cameras<00:05:23.960> again<00:05:24.080> are<00:05:24.350> going<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.530> tell<00:05:24.740> us<00:05:24.920> of

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
cameras again are going to tell us of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.650 
cameras again are going to tell us of
what<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.400> size<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.820> that<00:05:25.940> trip<00:05:26.210> string<00:05:26.510> needs

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
what the size of that trip string needs

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.320 
what the size of that trip string needs
to<00:05:26.810> be<00:05:27.020> if<00:05:27.230> you<00:05:27.980> have<00:05:28.130> larger<00:05:28.670> Sounders<00:05:29.180> of

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
to be if you have larger Sounders of

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.540 
to be if you have larger Sounders of
animals<00:05:29.750> Sounders<00:05:30.560> can<00:05:30.740> be<00:05:30.860> up<00:05:31.010> to<00:05:31.130> 30m

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
animals Sounders can be up to 30m

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.210 
animals Sounders can be up to 30m
individuals<00:05:32.300> maybe<00:05:32.480> more<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:33.800> want<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.100> make

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
individuals maybe more you want to make

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.470 
individuals maybe more you want to make
sure<00:05:34.460> that<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.730> caches<00:05:35.120> many<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.420> those

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
sure that you caches many of those

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.660 
sure that you caches many of those
animals<00:05:35.930> as<00:05:36.050> you<00:05:36.080> can<00:05:36.350> obviously<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.460> what

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
animals as you can obviously and what

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.030 
animals as you can obviously and what
you<00:05:37.820> do<00:05:38.000> is<00:05:38.300> put<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:38.990> trip<00:05:39.470> string<00:05:39.740> further

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
you do is put that trip string further

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.250 
you do is put that trip string further
to<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.340> back<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:40.910> trap<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.450> then<00:05:41.990> make

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
to the back of the trap and then make

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.280 
to the back of the trap and then make
sure<00:05:42.290> it's<00:05:42.500> only<00:05:42.980> in<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.190> small<00:05:43.250> area<00:05:44.290> where

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
sure it's only in a small area where

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.320 
sure it's only in a small area where
this<00:05:45.440> trip<00:05:45.800> string<00:05:46.100> here<00:05:46.370> is<00:05:46.400> only<00:05:46.700> about<00:05:46.850> four

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
this trip string here is only about four

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.960 
this trip string here is only about four
foot<00:05:47.570> wide<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:48.500> reason<00:05:48.920> for<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.430> is<00:05:49.670> if<00:05:49.820> this

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
foot wide the reason for that is if this

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.090 
foot wide the reason for that is if this
is<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.180> shorter<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.810> width<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.890> trip

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
is the shorter the width of the trip

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.610 
is the shorter the width of the trip
string<00:05:52.430> if<00:05:52.880> you've<00:05:53.090> got<00:05:53.270> larger<00:05:53.750> Sounders<00:05:54.260> you

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
string if you've got larger Sounders you

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.110 
string if you've got larger Sounders you
want<00:05:54.800> as<00:05:54.890> many<00:05:55.040> animals<00:05:55.550> in<00:05:55.670> there<00:05:55.820> before

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
want as many animals in there before

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.700 
want as many animals in there before
they<00:05:56.240> interact<00:05:56.660> with<00:05:56.720> that<00:05:56.930> that<00:05:57.140> trip<00:05:57.380> string

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
they interact with that that trip string

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.680 
they interact with that that trip string
as<00:05:57.890> you<00:05:58.010> can<00:05:58.250> whereas<00:05:59.150> if<00:05:59.390> you<00:05:59.510> have<00:05:59.660> a

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
as you can whereas if you have a

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.510 
as you can whereas if you have a
solitaire<00:06:00.380> board<00:06:00.740> or<00:06:01.040> you<00:06:01.130> have<00:06:01.280> a<00:06:01.310> small

solitaire board or you have a small
sounder<00:06:02.120> of<00:06:02.180> only<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.420> few<00:06:02.480> individuals<00:06:03.200> you

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
sounder of only a few individuals you

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.560 
sounder of only a few individuals you
try<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:03.920> put<00:06:04.370> your<00:06:04.520> trip<00:06:04.760> string<00:06:05.000> across<00:06:05.300> the
