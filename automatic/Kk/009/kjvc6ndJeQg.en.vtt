00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
with them some instructions and I think

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.270 
with them some instructions and I think
some<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.840> its<00:01:24.079> in<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:24.590> English<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.420> pretty

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
some of its in in English so it's pretty

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.249 
some of its in in English so it's pretty
understandable<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:29.450> they're<00:01:29.840> what<00:01:30.020> are<00:01:30.079> they

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
understandable and they're what are they

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.090 
understandable and they're what are they
going<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.920> make<00:01:31.399> sure<00:01:32.049> it<00:01:33.049> works<00:01:33.350> i'm<00:01:33.710> sure<00:01:33.979> it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
going to make sure it works i'm sure it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:44.399 
going to make sure it works i'm sure it
does<00:01:36.100> perfectly<00:01:40.869> with<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.789> playstation<00:01:43.789> vita

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
does perfectly with the playstation vita

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.830 
does perfectly with the playstation vita
we'll<00:01:45.409> get<00:01:45.710> into<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.280> then<00:01:46.430> again

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.230 

so<00:01:50.409> if<00:01:50.560> they're<00:01:50.770> pretty<00:01:51.009> pretty<00:01:51.640> basically

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
so if they're pretty pretty basically

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.450 
so if they're pretty pretty basically
stuffed<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.770> I'm<00:01:55.170> sure<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:57.280> would<00:01:57.429> work

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
stuffed and I'm sure it would work

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.889 
stuffed and I'm sure it would work
perfectly<00:01:58.060> we're<00:01:58.240> just<00:01:58.359> going<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.509> try<00:01:58.840> it

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
perfectly we're just going to try it

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.950 
perfectly we're just going to try it
very<00:01:59.649> quickly<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.240> there<00:02:01.390> we<00:02:01.479> go<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.750> fits

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
very quickly so there we go it fits

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.120 
very quickly so there we go it fits
perfectly<00:02:02.079> on<00:02:02.619> there<00:02:02.770> you're<00:02:02.920> probably

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
perfectly on there you're probably

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.490 
perfectly on there you're probably
wondering<00:02:03.549> what<00:02:04.000> all<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.149> fuss<00:02:04.329> is<00:02:04.390> about<00:02:04.569> and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
wondering what all the fuss is about and

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.779 
wondering what all the fuss is about and
the<00:02:05.590> reason<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.890> really<00:02:06.069> wanted<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:06.549> was

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
the reason I really wanted it was

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.080 
the reason I really wanted it was
because<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:07.390> need<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> do<00:02:08.349> some<00:02:08.530> videos<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
because I need to do some videos with

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.479 
because I need to do some videos with
games<00:02:10.360> using<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.989> pat<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.799> back<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
games using the the pat on the back the

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.970 
games using the the pat on the back the
touchpad<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.410> obviously<00:02:17.769> it's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
touchpad on the back and obviously it's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.500 
touchpad on the back and obviously it's
pretty<00:02:18.250> difficult<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.730> video<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.209> keep<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
pretty difficult to video and keep it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.690 
pretty difficult to video and keep it
also<00:02:19.840> still<00:02:20.190> hopefully<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.459> going<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
also still hopefully this is going to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.089 
also still hopefully this is going to
make<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:21.880> easier<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.630> do<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:23.829> going
