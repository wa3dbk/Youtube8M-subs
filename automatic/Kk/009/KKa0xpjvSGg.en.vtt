with one of the earpieces and pull this
off<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.770> requires<00:00:36.340> some<00:00:37.740> degree<00:00:38.740> of<00:00:39.010> force

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
off which requires some degree of force

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.030 
off which requires some degree of force
but<00:00:40.450> it<00:00:40.510> does<00:00:40.690> come<00:00:40.870> out<00:00:40.990> without<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.620> problem

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
but it does come out without a problem

but it does come out without a problem
this<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> earpiece<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.740> this<00:00:44.740> is<00:00:44.830> what

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
this is the earpiece and this is what

I'm<00:01:03.100> just<00:01:03.220> going<00:01:03.400> to<00:01:03.430> twist<00:01:03.640> out<00:01:03.880> that<00:01:04.059> screw

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I'm just going to twist out that screw

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.490 
I'm just going to twist out that screw
it's<00:01:07.420> gonna<00:01:07.510> take<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.780> little<00:01:07.900> bit<00:01:08.110> of<00:01:08.170> fun<00:01:08.350> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
even though these are probably Phillips

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.560 
even though these are probably Phillips
screws<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.880> I've<00:01:57.000> got<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> screws

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
screws so now that I've got the screws

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:16.160 
screws so now that I've got the screws
out<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.540> that's<00:02:15.690> all<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.020> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
out this out and that's all there is to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
out this out and that's all there is to
that<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.000> key<00:02:18.150> point<00:02:18.450> right<00:02:18.630> here

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
that this is the key point right here

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.860 
that this is the key point right here
this<00:02:19.400> across<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.580> back<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.510> piece

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
this across the back of this is a piece

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.910 
this across the back of this is a piece
of<00:02:21.900> tape<00:02:22.520> that's<00:02:23.520> covering<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.030> three<00:02:24.300> holes

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
of tape that's covering up three holes

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.580 
of tape that's covering up three holes
it<00:02:25.920> allows<00:02:26.160> air<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.489> pass<00:02:26.640> through<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.470> when

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
it allows air to pass through and when

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.100 
it allows air to pass through and when
those<00:02:28.739> holes<00:02:29.010> are<00:02:29.130> uncovered<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.840> bass

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
those holes are uncovered the bass

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.550 
those holes are uncovered the bass
response<00:02:31.380> goes<00:02:31.980> way<00:02:32.519> up<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
response goes way up so it's just that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.890 
response goes way up so it's just that
little<00:02:34.830> piece<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> tape<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:36.330> keeping<00:02:36.780> your

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
