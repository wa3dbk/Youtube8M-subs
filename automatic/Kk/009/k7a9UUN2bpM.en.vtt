right<00:01:33.090> through<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> still<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.690> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
right through it still got that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
right through it still got that
transparent<00:01:34.440> kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.710> look<00:01:34.860> let's<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.400> if

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
transparent kind of look let's see if

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.550 
transparent kind of look let's see if
there's<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.760> difference<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> white<00:01:37.290> base

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
there's a difference with the white base

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.820 
there's a difference with the white base
coat

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.800 

so<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.490> difference<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> me<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> obviously

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so the difference to me is obviously

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
so the difference to me is obviously
it's<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.229> first<00:01:49.470> coat<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.860> you're<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it's a first coat so you're not going to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's a first coat so you're not going to
get<00:01:50.400> everything<00:01:50.820> covered<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.330> got<00:01:51.479> some

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
get everything covered you got some

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.540 
get everything covered you got some
white<00:01:52.170> showing<00:01:52.440> underneath<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
white showing underneath but the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.190 
white showing underneath but the
difference<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.450> brightness<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> I'm

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
difference is the brightness and I'm

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.540 
difference is the brightness and I'm
hoping<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.800> is<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.100> come<00:01:56.310> through<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
hoping this is going to come through in

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.090 
hoping this is going to come through in
the<00:01:56.640> camera<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.720> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.140> duller<00:01:58.440> more

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the camera this is kind of a duller more

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.460 
the camera this is kind of a duller more
subdued<00:01:59.820> pink<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.140> blaze

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
subdued pink and then this is that blaze

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.350 
subdued pink and then this is that blaze
bright<00:02:01.950> pink<00:02:02.250> we'll<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.789> what<00:02:02.910> happens<00:02:03.210> after

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
bright pink we'll see what happens after

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:15.600 
bright pink we'll see what happens after
three<00:02:03.690> or<00:02:03.750> four<00:02:03.899> coats

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.220 

okay<00:02:16.610> guys<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:17.330> are<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> two<00:02:17.780> panels<00:02:18.020> that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
okay guys these are the two panels that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.630 
okay guys these are the two panels that
we<00:02:18.350> were<00:02:18.440> working<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.070> one<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.430> left

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
we were working with the one on the left

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.420 
we were working with the one on the left
here<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.060> white<00:02:20.900> bass<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.740> regular<00:02:22.250> white

Plasti Dip with three coats of blaze
pink<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.490> one<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> right<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
pink and the one on the right is the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.020 
pink and the one on the right is the
regular<00:02:26.840> metal<00:02:27.230> base<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:28.220> three<00:02:28.580> coats<00:02:28.850> of

regular metal base with three coats of
blaze<00:02:29.270> pink<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.840> difference<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.350> pretty

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
blaze pink and the difference is pretty

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.230 
blaze pink and the difference is pretty
obvious<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.460> one<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.730> right<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.060> little

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
obvious the one on the right is a little

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.110 
obvious the one on the right is a little
bit<00:02:32.420> less<00:02:33.020> coverage<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.700> little<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:34.970> can

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
bit less coverage it's a little you can

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.490 
bit less coverage it's a little you can
see<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.420> metal<00:02:35.720> through<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.320> little

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
see the metal through it just a little

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.770 
see the metal through it just a little
bit<00:02:36.620> more<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.190> one<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.520> left<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.970> much

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
bit more the one on the left is much

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.230 
bit more the one on the left is much
stronger<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:40.340> can't<00:02:40.580> see<00:02:40.730> anything<00:02:40.940> through

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
stronger you can't see anything through

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.900 
stronger you can't see anything through
it<00:02:41.420> it's<00:02:41.870> got<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> much<00:02:42.470> brighter<00:02:42.800> popular<00:02:43.610> pink

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
it it's got a much brighter popular pink

so I wanted to show you a difference

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.260 
so I wanted to show you a difference
between<00:02:45.650> using<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.250> blaze<00:02:46.460> products<00:02:46.910> with<00:02:47.240> a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
between using the blaze products with a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.770 
between using the blaze products with a
white<00:02:47.600> base<00:02:47.840> undercoat<00:02:48.410> versus<00:02:49.010> without<00:02:49.780> okay

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
white base undercoat versus without okay

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.000 
white base undercoat versus without okay
guys<00:02:50.960> now<00:02:51.110> what<00:02:51.230> we're<00:02:51.380> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.530> do<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.800> show

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
you each one of the blaze colors

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.790 
you each one of the blaze colors
individually<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.380> if<00:02:54.560> there's<00:02:54.740> a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
individually and if there's a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.440 
individually and if there's a
corresponding<00:02:55.580> fluorescent<00:02:56.090> color<00:02:56.270> that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
corresponding fluorescent color that

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.820 
corresponding fluorescent color that
goes<00:02:56.600> along<00:02:56.780> with<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.200> we're<00:02:57.530> going<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.680> put

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
goes along with it we're going to put

goes along with it we're going to put
that<00:02:58.010> right<00:02:58.190> next<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.850> can<00:02:58.970> see<00:02:59.090> the

that right next to it so you can see the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.600 
that right next to it so you can see the
difference<00:02:59.510> between<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.870> two<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:01.250> first

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
difference between the two this first

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.640 
difference between the two this first
one<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.180> blaze<00:03:02.720> pink<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:06.050> next<00:03:06.440> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
one is the blaze pink and this next to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.190 
one is the blaze pink and this next to
it<00:03:06.770> is<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:08.120> fluorescent<00:03:08.660> pink<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.050> we've

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
it is the fluorescent pink that we've

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.110 
it is the fluorescent pink that we've
offered<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.830> hot<00:03:10.010> pink<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.430> web<00:03:10.640> site<00:03:10.880> you

offered the hot pink on the web site you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120 
offered the hot pink on the web site you
can<00:03:11.960> see<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.290> difference<00:03:12.620> between<00:03:12.920> those<00:03:13.070> two

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
can see the difference between those two

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.950 
can see the difference between those two
there<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.670> blaze<00:03:13.910> Pink's<00:03:14.270> just<00:03:14.570> kind<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.840> a

the right the fluorescent pink is that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.720 
the right the fluorescent pink is that
hot<00:03:19.790> bubblegum<00:03:20.300> kind<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.630> pink<00:03:21.280> now<00:03:22.280> as<00:03:22.430> far<00:03:22.670> as
