00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
way I start flowing I'll either start

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.020 
way I start flowing I'll either start
from<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.259> bottom<00:01:08.409> or<00:01:09.369> I'll<00:01:09.549> start<00:01:09.790> from<00:01:09.880> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
from the bottom or I'll start from the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.700 
from the bottom or I'll start from the
side<00:01:10.180> but<00:01:10.450> for<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.689> video<00:01:10.930> I'll<00:01:11.200> show<00:01:11.439> from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
side but for the video I'll show from

side but for the video I'll show from
the<00:01:12.250> bottom<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:13.720> my<00:01:13.869> hands<00:01:14.080> are<00:01:14.259> here<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the bottom so my hands are here in the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.940 
the bottom so my hands are here in the
middle<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.810> you're<00:01:16.810> going<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.990> do<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.350> down<00:01:17.590> I

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
middle and you're going to do it down I

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.170 
middle and you're going to do it down I
so<00:01:18.400> ghost<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:20.200> your<00:01:20.979> right<00:01:21.310> hand<00:01:21.640> grabs

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
so ghost and then your right hand grabs

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.859 
so ghost and then your right hand grabs
so<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.320> can<00:01:23.530> do<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.520> next<00:01:24.700> step<00:01:24.820> which<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.479> push

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
so it can do the next step which is push

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
so it can do the next step which is push
it<00:01:26.020> out

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it out

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.410 
it out
so<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.340> you're<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.580> use<00:01:30.210> your

so from here you're going to use your
left<00:01:30.660> hand<00:01:30.810> cross<00:01:31.740> over<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.300> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
left hand cross over your right so that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.140 
left hand cross over your right so that
it<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.080> able<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.590> ghost<00:01:34.920> while<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.850> push

these motion your hands are getting all
mixed<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.540> again<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
mixed up so I'm going to do it again and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.530 
mixed up so I'm going to do it again and
I'm<00:02:55.739> going<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:55.920> slow<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.430> down<00:02:56.459> right<00:02:57.000> here<00:02:57.030> so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
I'm going to slow it down right here so

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.830 
I'm going to slow it down right here so
that<00:02:57.750> maybe<00:02:57.989> if<00:02:58.590> there's<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.250> way<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.549> I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
that maybe if there's a way that I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.150 
that maybe if there's a way that I
didn't<00:03:00.840> explain<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.709> see<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.010> better

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
didn't explain it you can see it better

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:12.090

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
and that is a ghosting isolated clover I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.390 
and that is a ghosting isolated clover I
hope<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:57.980> helps<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.519> have<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> wonderful<00:03:59.239> day
