I think this is a fabulous kitchen I
love<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> cook<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.020> could<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.289> myself

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
love to cook I could see myself

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.170 
love to cook I could see myself
preparing<00:02:10.950> great<00:02:11.280> meals<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.060> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
preparing great meals in there and just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.090 
preparing great meals in there and just
hanging<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.050> actually<00:02:13.170> more<00:02:13.500> practical

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
hanging out it's actually more practical

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.949 
hanging out it's actually more practical
too<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> look<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
too because then you have the look of a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.990 
too because then you have the look of a
white<00:02:16.140> kitchen<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> durability<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.850> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
white kitchen but the durability of a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.550 
white kitchen but the durability of a
wood<00:02:18.239> kitchen<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.959> think<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.319> very

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
wood kitchen so I think it's a very

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.250 
wood kitchen so I think it's a very
fresh<00:02:20.040> approach<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:23.180> trend<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.360> see<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.870> homes
