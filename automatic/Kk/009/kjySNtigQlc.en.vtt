here what chromatic scales are so I'm
only<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> demonstrate<00:00:46.950> what

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
only just going to demonstrate what

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
chromatic scales are but if the if you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.020 
chromatic scales are but if the if you
have<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> look<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.670> I've<00:00:50.820> done<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
have a look at this one I've done a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.540 
have a look at this one I've done a
chromatic<00:00:51.360> scale<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
chromatic scale on see you can do a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
chromatic scale on see you can do a
chromatic<00:00:53.910> scale<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.690> single<00:00:55.050> note<00:00:55.410> but

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
chromatic scale on any single note but

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
chromatic scale on any single note but
chromatic<00:00:56.520> scales<00:00:56.820> don't<00:00:57.329> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.809> warrant

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
chromatic scales don't kind of warrant

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200 
chromatic scales don't kind of warrant
writing<00:00:58.649> every<00:00:58.859> single<00:00:58.890> note<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.059> do

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
writing every single note out like we do

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
writing every single note out like we do
with<00:01:00.359> scales<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.620> aren't<00:01:01.949> exactly

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
with scales because they aren't exactly

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.490 
with scales because they aren't exactly
the<00:01:02.550> same<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.059> chromatic<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.140> playing

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the same so chromatic is just playing

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.380 
the same so chromatic is just playing
all<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.369> notes<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.850> order<00:01:08.390> literally

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
all of the notes in order literally

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
all of the notes in order literally
without<00:01:09.540> missing<00:01:10.170> anything<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
without missing anything out and the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
without missing anything out and the
fingering<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> exactly<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.049> same<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
fingering is exactly the same for all of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940 
fingering is exactly the same for all of
them<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.210> there's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.290> mix<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:16.860> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
them so there's a mix but there's an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
them so there's a mix but there's an
explanation<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.330> those<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
explanation on here with those so if you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
explanation on here with those so if you
go<00:01:18.960> ahead<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> read<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
go ahead and read that but if you have a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.719 
go ahead and read that but if you have a
look<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.880> page<00:01:21.210> 18<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> fingering

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
look on page 18 here is the fingering

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.270 
look on page 18 here is the fingering
rule<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.540> non-negotiable<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.740> both

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
rule and this is non-negotiable so both

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
rule and this is non-negotiable so both
hands<00:01:26.580> use<00:01:26.909> finger<00:01:27.240> 1<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> 3<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.350> usually

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
hands use finger 1 and 3 so it's usually

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
hands use finger 1 and 3 so it's usually
the<00:01:29.189> fingers<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> might<00:01:29.880> click<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the fingers that you might click with so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.899 
the fingers that you might click with so
both<00:01:30.720> hands<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.560> finger<00:01:31.920> 1<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> 3<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
both hands just use finger 1 and 3 but

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.690 
both hands just use finger 1 and 3 but
on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.810> hand<00:01:33.950> thing<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> number<00:01:35.369> 2

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
on the right hand thing the number 2

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.560 
on the right hand thing the number 2
goes<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.720> F<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.320> C<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> left<00:01:39.270> hand

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
goes on F and C and on the left hand

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.690 
goes on F and C and on the left hand
finger<00:01:40.140> 2<00:01:40.380> goes<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.130> E<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.729> B<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.310> were<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
finger 2 goes on E and B so if I were to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
finger 2 goes on E and B so if I were to
do<00:01:44.820> example<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.689> chromatic<00:01:46.140> scale<00:01:46.170> starting

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
do example the chromatic scale starting

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.969 
do example the chromatic scale starting
on<00:01:47.189> C<00:01:47.610> 1<00:01:48.299> 3<00:01:49.079> 1<00:01:49.649> 3<00:01:50.030> 1<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:52.259> finger<00:01:52.590> 2<00:01:52.710> goes

on C 1 3 1 3 1 and then my finger 2 goes

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.710 
on C 1 3 1 3 1 and then my finger 2 goes
on<00:01:53.130> F<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.880> said<00:01:54.140> carry<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.500> 3<00:01:56.270> 1<00:01:57.270> 3<00:01:57.570> 1

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
1/3 1/3 1/3 1/3 one you will end up

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.990 
1/3 1/3 1/3 1/3 one you will end up
doing<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.260> also<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.610> you're<00:02:21.760> getting

doing that also if you're getting

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.510 
doing that also if you're getting
confused<00:02:22.390> between<00:02:22.540> which<00:02:23.080> one<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:24.190> for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
confused between which one it is for for

confused between which one it is for for
the<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:24.790> hand<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.150> left<00:02:25.360> hand<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:25.750> if

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the right hand of the left hand so if

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
the right hand of the left hand so if
you<00:02:25.900> can't<00:02:26.110> remember<00:02:26.170> whether<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.740> F<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.190> C

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you can't remember whether it's F and C

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
you can't remember whether it's F and C
or<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:27.880> B<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.960> will<00:02:29.080> probably<00:02:29.350> be

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
or a and B it will probably be

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.050 
or a and B it will probably be
self-explanatory<00:02:30.190> when<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.670> come<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
self-explanatory when you come to

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.910 
self-explanatory when you come to
playing<00:02:31.570> them<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.050> for<00:02:32.170> example<00:02:33.060> 1/3<00:02:34.140> 1/3<00:02:35.140> if

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
playing them so for example 1/3 1/3 if

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.940 
playing them so for example 1/3 1/3 if
you<00:02:36.310> try<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.580> put<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.880> 2<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.690> e<00:02:38.200> you're<00:02:38.590> kind

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
you try to put a 2 on on e you're kind

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.640 
you try to put a 2 on on e you're kind
of<00:02:39.120> twisting<00:02:40.120> everything<00:02:40.240> under<00:02:40.990> so<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.350> isn't

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
of twisting everything under so it isn't

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.400 
of twisting everything under so it isn't
gonna<00:02:41.770> work

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
gonna work

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.070 
gonna work
see<00:02:44.010> two<00:02:44.250> nicely<00:02:44.790> fits<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:46.290> F<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:48.990> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
see two nicely fits on the F so if you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.540 
see two nicely fits on the F so if you
try<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.320> do<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.830> put<00:02:50.250> two<00:02:50.520> there

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
try and do that put two there

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.240 
try and do that put two there
everything's<00:02:51.240> gonna<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.600> twisting<00:02:52.170> under<00:02:52.620> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
everything's gonna be twisting under you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.950 
everything's gonna be twisting under you
can<00:02:53.370> carry<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.210> do<00:02:54.390> these<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
can carry these on and do these up to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.080 
can carry these on and do these up to
two<00:02:55.200> octaves<00:02:55.740> if<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.070> want<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.670> completely

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
two octaves if you want it's completely

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.180 
two octaves if you want it's completely
up<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.380> want<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.770> do<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> chromatic

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
up to you if you want to do a chromatic

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.300 
up to you if you want to do a chromatic
scale<00:02:59.370> starting<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.450> don't<00:03:00.510> know<00:03:00.750> f-sharp

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
scale starting on I don't know f-sharp

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.860 
scale starting on I don't know f-sharp
then<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.700> remember<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.240> what<00:03:03.510> note<00:03:03.720> would

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
then just remember what what note would

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.270 
then just remember what what note would
you<00:03:03.930> what<00:03:04.230> finger<00:03:04.560> would<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.800> put<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.010> f-sharp

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
you what finger would you put on f-sharp

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.570 
you what finger would you put on f-sharp
so<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.510> not<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.720> 2<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.680> 2<00:03:07.890> only<00:03:08.070> goes<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.400> F

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
so it's not a 2 because 2 only goes on F

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.340 
so it's not a 2 because 2 only goes on F
and<00:03:08.700> C<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> right<00:03:09.330> hand<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.990> not<00:03:10.140> gonna

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and C in the right hand it's not gonna

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.840 
and C in the right hand it's not gonna
be<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> thumb<00:03:10.830> because<00:03:11.070> we<00:03:11.280> don't<00:03:11.460> put<00:03:11.670> thumbs

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
be a thumb because we don't put thumbs

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.760 
be a thumb because we don't put thumbs
on<00:03:12.090> black<00:03:12.300> notes<00:03:12.600> but<00:03:13.050> we'll<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.440> start<00:03:13.650> with

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
on black notes but we'll just start with

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.030 
on black notes but we'll just start with
3<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.390> doing<00:03:15.780> starting<00:03:16.230> from<00:03:16.440> C<00:03:16.770> but

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
3 so it's like doing starting from C but

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.820 
3 so it's like doing starting from C but
we're<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:17.190> starting<00:03:17.430> halfway<00:03:18.120> up<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.540> 3<00:03:19.320> 1

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
we're just starting halfway up so 3 1

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.910 
we're just starting halfway up so 3 1
when<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.490> just<00:03:20.670> carry<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.180> normal<00:03:21.920> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
when you just carry on as normal the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.770 
when you just carry on as normal the
fingers<00:03:23.310> don't<00:03:23.610> change<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.180> any<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.660> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
fingers don't change for any of the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.990 
fingers don't change for any of the
notes

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
notes

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.060 
notes
I'll<00:03:27.540> follow<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.020> back<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.650> if<00:03:28.770> you've<00:03:28.890> done

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
I'll follow it back so if you've done

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.280 
I'll follow it back so if you've done
one<00:03:29.280> chromatic<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.870> them<00:03:31.050> all

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
one chromatic you can do them all

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440 
one chromatic you can do them all
chromatic<00:03:31.950> I'll<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.580> demonstrate<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.240> left

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
chromatic I'll just demonstrate the left

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.990

hand so one and three always pretty much

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.150 
hand so one and three always pretty much
always<00:03:36.210> start<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:37.050> on<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.680> white<00:03:37.830> notes

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
always start with one on the white notes

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.650 
always start with one on the white notes
and<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.580> threes<00:03:38.940> are<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.660> black<00:03:39.840> notes

and the threes are on the black notes
it's<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.780> two<00:03:43.110> here

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:57.270 

another<00:03:47.960> two<00:03:48.290> cuz<00:03:48.650> we're<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:48.860> be

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.490

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
and that is pretty much it with a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.410 
and that is pretty much it with a
chromatic<00:03:59.830> scale<00:04:00.040> so<00:04:00.850> there<00:04:01.120> was<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.270> pretty

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
chromatic scale so there was a pretty

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.300
