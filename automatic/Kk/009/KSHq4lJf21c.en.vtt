this<00:02:51.120> year<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.630> very<00:02:51.980> very<00:02:52.980> good<00:02:53.160> very

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
this year is very very good very

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.280 
this year is very very good very
consistent<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.150> think<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:55.050> million

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
consistent I think that's the million

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.570 
consistent I think that's the million
part<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> horse<00:02:56.040> because<00:02:56.370> he's<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
part of the horse because he's a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.880 
part of the horse because he's a
stallion<00:02:56.850> as<00:02:57.210> well<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.960> stallions<00:02:58.260> tanta

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
stallion as well and stallions tanta

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.530 
stallion as well and stallions tanta
things<00:02:59.370> they<00:02:59.520> can<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.910> good<00:02:59.940> days<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.300> bad

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
things they can have good days and bad

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.450 
things they can have good days and bad
days<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:00.960> under<00:03:01.590> ring<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.980> horse<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.400> very

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
days but under ring the horse is very

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.340 
days but under ring the horse is very
very<00:03:02.880> consistent<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.690> he<00:03:03.750> always<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:04.200> he

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
very consistent and he always as he

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.540 
very consistent and he always as he
always<00:03:04.530> tries<00:03:04.830> his<00:03:05.010> best<00:03:05.040> there<00:03:05.430> may<00:03:05.520> be

always tries his best there may be
equals<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.290> bonus<00:03:07.710> for<00:03:07.860> some

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
equals and so that's a bonus for some

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.000 
equals and so that's a bonus for some
you<00:03:08.190> know<00:03:08.570> what<00:03:09.570> will<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:09.990> now<00:03:10.200> leading<00:03:10.770> of
