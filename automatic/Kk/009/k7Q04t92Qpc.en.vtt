00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:12.920
 Tokushima Vortis who became the first S1 team in Shikoku that is a focus sport is now Kochi 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:16.690
 I'm sweating to build a foundation that can compete in the top leagues in Japan at the camp 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.690
 It is a report of Shinya Enomoto announcer 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.730
 Sunlight wind is not so mildly cold 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.500
 Now, practice is also serious from today. J Build strength to fight 1 out 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.500
 It will start thorough thrust 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.640
 Practice starts every day at 9:30 am 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 The theme of this primary camp in Kochi Haruno is to create a foundation for j 1 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.850
 Tassa more than ever seeks to each player to fight for a year against the rivals 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.960
 Will be 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.760
 I immediately entered into tough physical training 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.760
 Various 30 seconds 4 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 It is an interval run to go out of the pitch 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.070
 Run a distance of about 1 kilometer and repeat the rest 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.370
 The physical training that is used in the game is more severe than it looks 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.370
 Come 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:22.030
 Takagi 's birth is the physical coach who takes charge of training 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.600
 The main smell the page says that one go up minute first, raise-based up in this Kochi 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 The 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.659
 So I'm wondering if we should be well prepared for the opening of Miyazaki 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.469
 Also It seems another stamina tree record 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:39.429
 So is the speed agility Musashi power, and there 's a total there 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:42.100
 If you're thinking eye color place called wonder if I have to raise on the other one rank 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.969
 It is different for Do you Tsu Do Well anymore at all no 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.009
 Also a little restrained unless Ikena part I is the Tteyuu because reverse a little finish is too early 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.120
 I'm wondering if there is Kuroko 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.580
 What 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.890
 Hmm 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.890
 It is practice using ball from the afternoon 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.220
 The atmosphere is at the top showing how new players have melted 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.630
 There is a fever in the coaching of Kobayashi 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.610
 Speed ​​up to vertical pass when saying that the awareness of the ball holder and the above-mentioned awareness that there is no ball 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.060
 There are people who are worried about getting involved 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:30.120
 That there is a side change 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.650
 I think that I should put some stimulation in the attack 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.990
 The final round of practice games 8 to 8 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.819
 Hayashi's aim was to create a good shape over and over again in the vertical attack 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:48.170
 This scene will this 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.170
 Central data is Hanai This vertical path of Hanai is included and the last is Hirose 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.260
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.390
 Anyway, take this day vertically 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.160
 Get in front of the goal with a thorough attack of other boats 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.370
 Above all, it was released from the weather Yamagata that was released with a time limit transfer 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.909
 Hirose of pit fielder 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.190
 Started a professional career under the guidance of Kobayashi 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:16.760
 It's like Kobayashi chilled noodles 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:19.110
 I was appealing with 4 points by making use of the breakthrough power in front of the goal which is a weapon 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.160
 Equivalent now 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:29.400
 I think it's really hard to get 3 points in a really tough season 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.959
 I think it's really hard to say and bought picking up is how teams work together points 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.720
 I think if everyone should do after all the action strict training of people parent and child 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.590
 100% 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:45.239
 I think that if you do it, I think that the results will come true 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.400
 Finally, I heard about the teacher Shinji Kobayashi director who started a career 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.800
 What is it really ? 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.080
 It's a strange example but it feels like a father 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.080
 That's right I think it would be nice if I could be a good friend 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.890
 I want you to do my best I'm motivated to include physical fitness for a certain purpose 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.480
 It looks like 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.640
 It looks like you can expect 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.690
 Now Kedomo is this rope beating executives Kochi camp more than that will be held until this month of 29 days 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.690
 It was the focus sport
