week but it's been great here I've been
settling<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.179> well<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.660> teammates<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.470> been

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650

really friendly the coaches have been
really<00:00:19.230> friendly<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.619> right<00:00:20.609> from<00:00:20.789> day<00:00:20.970> one

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
really friendly and right from day one

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
really friendly and right from day one
you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.689> stepped<00:00:22.199> into<00:00:22.350> practice<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
you know we stepped into practice and I

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.080 
you know we stepped into practice and I
went<00:00:24.269> hard<00:00:24.480> at<00:00:25.109> first<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> was<00:00:25.619> pretty<00:00:25.800> tough

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
went hard at first it was pretty tough

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.870 
went hard at first it was pretty tough
acclimating<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> heat<00:00:27.830> but<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.730> guess

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
acclimating to the heat but as I guess

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.749 
acclimating to the heat but as I guess
days<00:00:30.330> went<00:00:30.689> by<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.769> guess<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> last<00:00:32.460> few<00:00:32.610> days

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
days went by I guess the last few days

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
days went by I guess the last few days
have<00:00:32.910> been<00:00:32.969> pretty<00:00:33.059> cool<00:00:33.510> compared<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
have been pretty cool compared to the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.709 
have been pretty cool compared to the
first<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.340> I've<00:00:36.149> been<00:00:36.270> adjusting

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
first three so I've been adjusting

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.360 
first three so I've been adjusting
pretty<00:00:36.899> well<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.649> can't<00:00:37.980> wait<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> keep

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
pretty well and I can't wait to keep

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
pretty well and I can't wait to keep
going<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.440> finish<00:00:40.440> strong<00:00:51.440> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
going and going and finish strong of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
going and going and finish strong of
course<00:00:53.329> training<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.539> home<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.899> definitely

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
course training at home is definitely

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.930 
course training at home is definitely
not<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> same<00:00:55.800> thing<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.039> training<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.640> here

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
not the same thing as training over here

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.040 
not the same thing as training over here
and<00:00:58.010> just<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.190> even<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> week<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.210> felt<00:01:00.539> my

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and just not even in a week I felt my

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.299 
and just not even in a week I felt my
game<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
game up a lot and and I think that you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
game up a lot and and I think that you
know<00:01:05.400> throughout<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> whole<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.420> rest<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
know throughout the whole the rest of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.969 
know throughout the whole the rest of
the<00:01:06.810> season<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.350> keep<00:01:07.530> training<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.950> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the season if I keep training like this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
the season if I keep training like this
then<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:09.090> game<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.080> better

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
then my game is going to be a lot better

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
then my game is going to be a lot better
and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.830> could<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.520> more<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.939> Kansas

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and I could do a lot more for Kansas

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.690 
and I could do a lot more for Kansas
City

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.750 

the<00:01:15.700> way<00:01:15.850> things

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
the way things

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.359 
the way things
I<00:01:19.440> mean<00:01:20.440> there's<00:01:20.619> just<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.830> structure<00:01:21.220> in

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
I mean there's just a structure in

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.789 
I mean there's just a structure in
practice<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:23.020> can't<00:01:23.260> match<00:01:23.409> anywhere

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
practice that you can't match anywhere

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.050 
practice that you can't match anywhere
else<00:01:24.010> where<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.310> start<00:01:24.549> off<00:01:24.670> with<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> good

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
else where you start off with a good

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.690 
else where you start off with a good
warm-up<00:01:25.560> good<00:01:26.560> possession<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.340> then<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.549> can

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
warm-up good possession and then you can

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.999 
warm-up good possession and then you can
move<00:01:27.820> into<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.210> game<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.590> teammates

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
move into a game and and the teammates

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.010 
move into a game and and the teammates
are<00:01:30.280> definitely<00:01:31.210> up<00:01:31.330> at<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.570> next<00:01:31.840> level

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
are definitely up at the next level

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.020 
are definitely up at the next level
where<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:32.560> could<00:01:32.920> play<00:01:33.070> them<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.909> know

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
where you could play them and you know

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.580 
where you could play them and you know
you<00:01:34.090> trust<00:01:34.420> them<00:01:34.540> with<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.780> ball<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.200> they

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
you trust them with the ball and they

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.350 
you trust them with the ball and they
could<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:35.890> anything<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.640> they<00:01:36.670> want<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
could do anything that they want and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.450 
could do anything that they want and
they<00:01:38.200> also<00:01:38.320> could<00:01:38.649> flip<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:38.979> through<00:01:39.250> and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
they also could flip you through and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.980 
they also could flip you through and
it's<00:01:39.880> good<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.240> know<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.659> have<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.810> lot<00:01:40.960> of

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
it's good to know that you have a lot of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's good to know that you have a lot of
support<00:01:41.409> behind<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.979> kind<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:45.940> gold

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
support behind you what is kind of gold

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.910 
support behind you what is kind of gold
I<00:01:48.610> guess<00:01:49.210> some<00:01:49.960> goals<00:01:50.200> would<00:01:50.380> be<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.740> combine

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
I guess some goals would be to combine

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.900 
I guess some goals would be to combine
with<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.729> likes<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.300> CJ<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.050> Omar<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.800> KY<00:01:54.399> and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
with the likes of CJ and Omar and KY and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.340 
with the likes of CJ and Omar and KY and
the<00:01:54.940> rest<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.390> teammates<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.170> guess

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the rest of the teammates and I guess

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.609 
the rest of the teammates and I guess
learned<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.429> adapt<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:58.479> how<00:01:58.600> they<00:01:58.750> play<00:01:59.020> also

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
learned to adapt to how they play also

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.790 
learned to adapt to how they play also
learn<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.039> depth<00:02:00.310> out<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.759> coach<00:02:00.970> has<00:02:01.800> his

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
learn to depth out the coach has his

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.330 
learn to depth out the coach has his
formation<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.700> how<00:02:03.850> he<00:02:03.909> likes<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.420> play<00:02:05.340> also

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
formation and how he likes to play also

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.130 
formation and how he likes to play also
I<00:02:06.610> guess<00:02:06.940> becoming<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.390> fan<00:02:07.569> favorite<00:02:07.990> would<00:02:08.110> be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
I guess becoming a fan favorite would be

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.309 
I guess becoming a fan favorite would be
a<00:02:08.590> long<00:02:09.190> term<00:02:09.369> goal<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:10.539> spoke<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:10.989> radio

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
