now it's down the location where the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.940 
now it's down the location where the
next<00:01:22.160> pivot<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:24.110> horse<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.470> retarded

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950

animus sinking and go to the map now you
want<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.290> place<00:01:42.470> another<00:01:42.710> pivot<00:01:43.100> point<00:01:43.340> to

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
want to place another pivot point to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.700 
want to place another pivot point to
narrow<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:43.970> down<00:01:44.000> even<00:01:44.479> further<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.590> can

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
narrow it down even further so you can

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.320 
narrow it down even further so you can
see<00:01:45.860> as<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.100> place<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.460> pivot<00:01:46.729> point<00:01:46.790> the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
see as I place that pivot point the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.780 
see as I place that pivot point the
green<00:01:47.509> area<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:48.050> where<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.470> gonna<00:01:48.530> be<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:49.040> put

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
green area is where it's gonna be I put

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.130 
green area is where it's gonna be I put
a<00:01:49.820> little<00:01:49.970> custom<00:01:50.390> marker<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.810> show<00:01:50.840> myself

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
a little custom marker to show myself

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.010 
a little custom marker to show myself
which<00:01:51.560> way<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.740> got<00:01:51.979> ahead<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.780> once<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.900> get

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
which way I got ahead and once you get

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.749 
which way I got ahead and once you get
close<00:01:54.259> enough<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.800> that<00:01:54.890> pivot<00:01:55.369> point<00:01:55.399> will

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
close enough to that pivot point will

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.310 
close enough to that pivot point will
reveal<00:01:56.119> itself<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.869> don't<00:01:56.930> have<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.170> keep

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
reveal itself you don't have to keep

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.469 
reveal itself you don't have to keep
placing<00:01:57.619> animus<00:01:58.100> markers<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.180> small

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
placing animus markers it's so small

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.990 
placing animus markers it's so small
that<00:01:59.540> you<00:02:00.470> know<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.890> you're<00:02:01.340> right<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.610> top<00:02:01.820> of

that you know it you're right on top of
it<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.479> need<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.690> be<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.960> general

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
it you just need to be in the general

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.780 
it you just need to be in the general
area<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.770> you'll<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:04.070> it'll<00:02:04.280> pop<00:02:04.460> up<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.759> your

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
area and you'll see it'll pop up on your

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.420 
area and you'll see it'll pop up on your
map<00:02:05.320> when<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.350> think<00:02:06.590> when<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.740> reach<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.250> bridge

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
map when I think when I reach the bridge

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.940 
map when I think when I reach the bridge
here<00:02:07.670> you'll<00:02:07.850> see<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:12.530> right<00:02:12.709> there<00:02:12.920> see

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
here you'll see it see right there see

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.260 
here you'll see it see right there see
that<00:02:13.160> little<00:02:13.489> square<00:02:13.820> in<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> top-left

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
that little square in the top-left

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.259 
that little square in the top-left
corner<00:02:14.660> there<00:02:14.989> that's<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.890> pivot<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.400> once

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
corner there that's the pivot so once

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.780 
corner there that's the pivot so once
you<00:02:17.390> get<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:19.190> you're<00:02:19.489> close<00:02:19.760> enough

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
you get that you you're close enough

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.580 
you get that you you're close enough
it'll<00:02:20.330> show<00:02:20.480> up<00:02:20.570> on<00:02:20.690> your<00:02:20.870> map<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.380> go

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
it'll show up on your map and you go

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.650 
it'll show up on your map and you go
collect<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.250> didn't<00:02:23.090> see<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.299> right<00:02:23.450> away

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
collect it I didn't see it right away

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.580 
collect it I didn't see it right away
so<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.019> place<00:02:24.230> another<00:02:24.470> pivot<00:02:24.830> down<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.590> notice

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
so I place another pivot down and notice

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.800 
so I place another pivot down and notice
how<00:02:27.709> small<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.220> there's<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> go<00:02:29.360> okay<00:02:29.570> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
how small it is there's a go okay I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
how small it is there's a go okay I
basically<00:02:30.620> realized<00:02:30.890> I'm<00:02:31.280> right<00:02:31.850> on<00:02:31.970> top<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
basically realized I'm right on top of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.740 
basically realized I'm right on top of
it<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:34.370> could<00:02:34.489> pick<00:02:34.700> pivots<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.480> move

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it and you could pick pivots up and move

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750 
it and you could pick pivots up and move
them<00:02:35.930> around<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.410> have<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.950> couple<00:02:37.280> now<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:37.730> I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
them around I have a couple now so I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.100 
them around I have a couple now so I
don't<00:02:37.820> really<00:02:38.030> have<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.540> keep<00:02:38.720> picking<00:02:38.900> them

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
don't really have to keep picking them

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.180 
don't really have to keep picking them
up<00:02:39.170> but<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> beginning<00:02:39.860> you'll<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.100> like

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
up but in the beginning you'll have like

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.430 
up but in the beginning you'll have like
three<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:41.150> you'll<00:02:41.269> place<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:41.630> two<00:02:41.840> down<00:02:42.049> pick

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
three so you'll place like two down pick

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.259 
three so you'll place like two down pick
up<00:02:42.560> one<00:02:42.830> that's<00:02:43.250> far<00:02:43.489> away<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.880> move<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> to

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
up one that's far away and move it to

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.850 
up one that's far away and move it to
where<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.480> are<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.440> know<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.650> want<00:02:45.799> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
where you are and you know you want to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.860 
where you are and you know you want to
narrow<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.160> down<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.519> way<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.510> there's<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
narrow it down that way so there's the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.180 
narrow it down that way so there's the
pivot<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.350> looks<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.709> little<00:02:48.980> horse

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
pivot and looks like a little horse

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.880 
pivot and looks like a little horse
symbol<00:02:49.670> or<00:02:50.000> whatever<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.739> collect

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
symbol or whatever it is and you collect

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.740 
symbol or whatever it is and you collect
it<00:02:52.130> now<00:02:52.310> what<00:02:52.790> these<00:02:52.910> pivots<00:02:53.299> are<00:02:53.480> is

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
it now what these pivots are is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.970 
it now what these pivots are is
basically<00:02:54.530> cheat<00:02:54.890> codes<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.870> order<00:02:57.200> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
basically cheat codes so in order to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.430 
basically cheat codes so in order to
enable<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.850> if<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.209> want<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.989> hit<00:03:00.140> start

hack now these are all the pivots that

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.780 
hack now these are all the pivots that
I've<00:03:06.410> picked<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:06.920> far<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.280> each<00:03:07.400> one<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
you collect those in the frontier and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.640 
you collect those in the frontier and
you're<00:03:47.510> like<00:03:47.630> okay<00:03:47.990> so<00:03:48.050> there's<00:03:48.290> some<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.560> New

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
you're like okay so there's some in New

you're like okay so there's some in New
York<00:03:48.830> as<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.160> look<00:03:49.310> at<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.580> once<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.540> look

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
York as you look at that once you look

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.330 
York as you look at that once you look
at<00:03:50.810> pivot<00:03:51.140> info<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.590> tells<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.920> which<00:03:52.070> ones

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
at pivot info it tells you which ones

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.220 
at pivot info it tells you which ones
are<00:03:52.520> next<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.120> tells<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.570> where<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.750> go<00:03:53.960> so

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
are next and tells you where to go so

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.960 
are next and tells you where to go so
they<00:03:54.470> already<00:03:54.560> are<00:03:54.710> and<00:03:54.860> then<00:03:55.130> you're<00:03:55.760> gonna

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
they already are and then you're gonna

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.420 
they already are and then you're gonna
just<00:03:56.360> keep<00:03:56.780> doing<00:03:57.110> that<00:03:57.140> until<00:03:57.530> you're

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
just keep doing that until you're

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.280 
just keep doing that until you're
waiting<00:03:58.790> for<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.360> detect<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.900> other<00:04:00.020> ones

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
waiting for it to detect the other ones

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.500 
waiting for it to detect the other ones
so<00:04:00.890> as<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.100> see<00:04:01.280> here<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.580> go<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.820> pivot<00:04:02.030> info

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
so as you see here I go to pivot info

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.900 
so as you see here I go to pivot info
and<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.440> all<00:04:03.620> these<00:04:03.770> so<00:04:04.220> it's<00:04:04.430> nothing's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
little symbol that's changing numbers

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 
little symbol that's changing numbers

said<00:04:45.200> 60%<00:04:45.620> boost<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.330> guess<00:04:47.510> if<00:04:47.630> your

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
said 60% boost so I guess if your

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.270 
said 60% boost so I guess if your
friends<00:04:48.140> have<00:04:48.170> done<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.890> get<00:04:49.040> like<00:04:49.130> a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
friends have done it you get like a

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.920 
friends have done it you get like a
boost<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.700> how<00:04:49.760> fast<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.300> detects<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:50.840> or

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
boost and how fast it detects it or

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.260 
boost and how fast it detects it or
something<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.550> could<00:04:52.550> be<00:04:52.640> wrong<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.060> I

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
something I could be wrong in that I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.490 
something I could be wrong in that I
don't<00:04:53.480> know<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.570> just<00:04:53.660> noticed<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.140> now<00:04:54.350> as

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
so I'm going to start placing the pivot

points down again got a fast travel
place<00:05:25.880> another<00:05:26.150> pivot<00:05:26.510> point<00:05:26.750> now<00:05:26.930> down

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
