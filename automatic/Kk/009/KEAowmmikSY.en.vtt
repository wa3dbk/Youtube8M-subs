00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.800 
guys were interested in the Arceus is a
man-made<00:00:16.470> Pokemon<00:00:17.220> theory<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.180> decided

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
man-made Pokemon theory that I decided

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.740 
man-made Pokemon theory that I decided
to<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> little<00:00:19.619> bit<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> research<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.760> talk

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
to do a little bit of research and talk

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.300 
to do a little bit of research and talk
about<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.140> today<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.410> let's<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:22.980> into<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
about it today so let's get into that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.150 
about it today so let's get into that
let's<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.539> keep<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.990> mind<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.859> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
let's just keep in mind that this is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.240 
let's just keep in mind that this is
just<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.849> Pokemon<00:00:27.539> theory<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.740> seem<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
just a Pokemon theory so it can seem a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
just a Pokemon theory so it can seem a
little<00:00:29.279> ridiculous<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.539> dumb<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.439> guess<00:00:31.679> but

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
little ridiculous and dumb I guess but

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.520 
little ridiculous and dumb I guess but
let's<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:33.180> fun<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.050> at

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
let's just have some fun with it at

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
let's just have some fun with it at
first<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.850> against<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.540> theory

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
first I was really against this theory

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
first I was really against this theory
but<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> try<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> keep<00:00:37.860> an<00:00:38.160> open<00:00:38.340> mind<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.059> my

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
but I try to keep an open mind so my

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.959 
but I try to keep an open mind so my
opinion<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.320> change<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.430> first

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
opinion can change here and there first

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.330 
opinion can change here and there first
off<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.110> Arceus<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
off when we think of Arceus we think of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.389 
off when we think of Arceus we think of
the<00:00:44.670> God<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.510> Pokemon<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.190> through

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the God of all Pokemon we see it through

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.660 
the God of all Pokemon we see it through
the<00:00:47.520> anime<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> Pokemon<00:00:49.379> games

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
the anime we see it in the Pokemon games

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
the anime we see it in the Pokemon games
but<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> Pokedex<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.680> never

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
but actually in the Pokedex it's never

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
but actually in the Pokedex it's never
labeled<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> God<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> all

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
labeled you know like the God of all

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
labeled you know like the God of all
Pokemon<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.300> labeled<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
Pokemon it's actually labeled the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.490 
Pokemon it's actually labeled the
creator<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.430> point<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.329> origin<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.260> my

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
creator or a point of origin in my

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
creator or a point of origin in my
opinion<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> anime<00:01:02.670> does<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.300> much<00:01:03.570> better<00:01:03.600> job

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
opinion the anime does a much better job

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.609 
opinion the anime does a much better job
of<00:01:04.860> portraying<00:01:05.720> Arceus<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.470> an

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
of portraying Arceus as you know an

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.460 
of portraying Arceus as you know an
all-powerful<00:01:08.159> being<00:01:08.549> while<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> games

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
all-powerful being while in the games

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
all-powerful being while in the games
it's<00:01:10.830> not<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.280> too<00:01:11.580> clear<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.510> don't

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's not really too clear they don't

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
it's not really too clear they don't
really<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> direct<00:01:14.430> approach<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
really take that a direct approach of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789 
really take that a direct approach of
Arceus<00:01:15.540> being<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> god<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> while

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
Arceus being like the god and while

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
Arceus being like the god and while
bugging<00:01:17.159> them<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.270> i'm

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
trying to say so the first argument

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.240 
trying to say so the first argument
people<00:01:20.700> make<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.600> Arceus<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> god<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

first<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:27.030> answer<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.810> question<00:01:28.290> was

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
first my answer to this question was

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.920 
first my answer to this question was
well<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.130> Pokemon<00:01:29.670> game<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.329> would<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.659> no

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
well it's a Pokemon game it would be no

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.710 
well it's a Pokemon game it would be no
fun<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.159> couldn't<00:01:32.520> catch<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.030> God<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> all

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
fun if you couldn't catch the God of all

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
fun if you couldn't catch the God of all
Pokemon<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.920> let's<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.790> from

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
Pokemon but let's think about it from

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.039 
Pokemon but let's think about it from
this<00:01:36.119> perspective<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.619> our<00:01:37.939> Arceus

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
this perspective what if our Arceus

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.390 
this perspective what if our Arceus
isn't<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> pokemon<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.250> it's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
isn't really a pokemon what if it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.030 
isn't really a pokemon what if it's
man-made<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.570> artificial<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.409> mean

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
man-made what if it's artificial I mean

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.639 
man-made what if it's artificial I mean
the<00:01:44.159> first<00:01:44.399> clue<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.570> Arceus<00:01:46.020> being<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the first clue we have to Arceus being a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.969 
the first clue we have to Arceus being a
man-made<00:01:47.520> pokemon<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.930> arch<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.470> its<00:01:49.680> back

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
man-made pokemon is the arch on its back

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
man-made pokemon is the arch on its back
you<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> McDonald's<00:01:51.270> looking<00:01:51.630> em<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
you know at the McDonald's looking em it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.280 
you know at the McDonald's looking em it
doesn't<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.340> something<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
doesn't really look like something that

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.660 
doesn't really look like something that
is<00:01:55.290> natural<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.490> trying

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
that Pokemon but you're catching an

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.170 
that Pokemon but you're catching an
image<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.530> them<00:04:01.740> because<00:04:02.459> if<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.700> were<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
image of them because if you were to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720 
image of them because if you were to
catch<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.690> only<00:04:04.140> mu<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.890> Pokemon<00:04:05.430> games

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
catch the only mu in the Pokemon games

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.750 
catch the only mu in the Pokemon games
wouldn't<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> game<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:07.500> self<00:04:08.280> implode

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
wouldn't the game like self implode

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.640 
wouldn't the game like self implode
wouldn't<00:04:09.240> like<00:04:09.330> everything<00:04:09.840> be<00:04:10.020> ruined<00:04:10.500> like

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
wouldn't like everything be ruined like

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.979 
wouldn't like everything be ruined like
like<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.790> game<00:04:11.970> would<00:04:12.150> basically<00:04:12.660> shut<00:04:12.959> down

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
like the game would basically shut down

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.070 
like the game would basically shut down
so<00:04:13.890> some<00:04:14.520> people<00:04:14.640> say<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.450> are<00:04:15.480> catching

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080

so some people say that you are catching
an<00:04:16.320> image<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.970> Pokemon<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:19.049> backs<00:04:19.620> up

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
an image of that Pokemon that backs up

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.520 
an image of that Pokemon that backs up
the<00:04:20.310> idea<00:04:20.730> if<00:04:21.000> Arceus<00:04:21.570> was<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.140> god<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.350> a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
the idea if Arceus was the god of a

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.260 
the idea if Arceus was the god of a
Pokemon<00:04:22.979> you're<00:04:23.130> not<00:04:23.250> really<00:04:23.460> catching<00:04:23.760> him

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
Pokemon you're not really catching him

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.320 
Pokemon you're not really catching him
you're<00:04:24.810> catching<00:04:25.290> and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
you're catching and

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.659 
you're catching and

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
and then somehow the Pokemon world

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.820 
and then somehow the Pokemon world
doesn't<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.720> know<00:04:29.840> ruin<00:04:30.229> itself<00:04:30.560> because

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
doesn't you know ruin itself because

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.379 
doesn't you know ruin itself because
you're<00:04:31.009> only<00:04:31.099> catching<00:04:31.520> an<00:04:31.610> image<00:04:31.909> of<00:04:32.060> him<00:04:32.210> and

you're only catching an image of him and

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.170 
you're only catching an image of him and
not<00:04:32.509> the<00:04:32.539> actual<00:04:32.930> Arceus<00:04:33.800> now<00:04:34.099> I<00:04:34.129> am<00:04:34.490> NOT<00:04:34.819> one

videos for obvious reasons but I will
today<00:04:40.099> to<00:04:40.909> open<00:04:41.300> up<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.569> different<00:04:41.990> perspective

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 
today to open up a different perspective

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.339 
today to open up a different perspective
for<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.430> guys<00:04:43.639> maybe<00:04:44.000> make<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.389> point<00:04:44.720> let's

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
for you guys maybe make a point let's

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.950 
for you guys maybe make a point let's
say<00:04:45.560> that<00:04:45.919> Mew<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:46.520> that<00:04:46.940> Jesus<00:04:47.509> of<00:04:47.750> all

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
say that Mew is that Jesus of all

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.369 
say that Mew is that Jesus of all
pokémon<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.800> Arceus<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.210> Holy<00:04:50.449> Spirit<00:04:50.599> so

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
pokémon and Arceus is the Holy Spirit so

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.830 
pokémon and Arceus is the Holy Spirit so
some<00:04:51.710> of<00:04:51.740> us<00:04:51.979> may<00:04:52.310> be<00:04:52.340> familiar<00:04:53.090> with<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.419> idea

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
some of us may be familiar with the idea

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.469 
some of us may be familiar with the idea
that<00:04:53.930> God<00:04:54.440> is<00:04:54.470> Father<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.669> Son<00:04:55.909> and<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.330> Holy

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
that God is Father the Son and the Holy

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.129 
that God is Father the Son and the Holy
Spirit<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.560> God<00:04:57.830> is<00:04:58.280> God<00:04:58.729> Jesus<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.569> the<00:04:59.960> Holy

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
Spirit so God is God Jesus and the Holy

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.950 
Spirit so God is God Jesus and the Holy
Spirit<00:05:00.409> that<00:05:01.250> would<00:05:01.430> translate<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.599> the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
Spirit that would translate to the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.610 
Spirit that would translate to the
Pokemon<00:05:03.650> world<00:05:03.849> that<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:05.270> Pokemon<00:05:05.780> God<00:05:06.110> is

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
Pokemon world that the Pokemon God is

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.689 
Pokemon world that the Pokemon God is
the<00:05:06.979> Pokemon<00:05:07.400> God<00:05:07.669> plus<00:05:08.330> mu<00:05:08.780> plus<00:05:09.590> Arceus<00:05:10.460> if

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
the Pokemon God plus mu plus Arceus if

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.119 
the Pokemon God plus mu plus Arceus if
Arceus<00:05:11.300> is<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.719> Holy<00:05:11.930> Spirit<00:05:12.469> this<00:05:12.770> would

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
Arceus is the Holy Spirit this would

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.420 
Arceus is the Holy Spirit this would
support<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.849> idea<00:05:13.879> when<00:05:14.870> you're<00:05:15.050> catching

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
those were two perspectives on the idea

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.320 
those were two perspectives on the idea
of<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.900> Arceus<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.710> man-made<00:05:40.430> pokemon<00:05:41.090> the

first half of the video focused on if

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.999 
first half of the video focused on if

today's<00:05:51.110> video<00:05:51.319> focused<00:05:51.979> on<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:52.219> idea<00:05:52.580> that

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
today's video focused on the idea that

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.990 
today's video focused on the idea that
Arceus<00:05:53.560> possibly<00:05:54.560> could<00:05:54.860> be<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.190> holy<00:05:55.460> spirit

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
Arceus possibly could be the holy spirit

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.480 
Arceus possibly could be the holy spirit
and<00:05:56.150> we<00:05:56.569> don't<00:05:56.779> even<00:05:56.960> know<00:05:57.319> the<00:05:57.590> Pokemon<00:05:58.129> God

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
and we don't even know the Pokemon God

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.909
