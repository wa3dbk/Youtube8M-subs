00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
where it lines off and then just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.110 
where it lines off and then just
continue<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.750> cutting<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.080> rest<00:01:46.260> off<00:01:47.120> so

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
really don't have to do this step this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
really don't have to do this step this
is<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.120> I<00:01:54.150> want<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.080> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
made distressed pants yet so I really

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.570 
made distressed pants yet so I really
wanted<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> start<00:01:58.920> off<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.190> something<00:01:59.400> like

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
wanted to start off with something like

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.330 
wanted to start off with something like
this<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.080> now<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.650> doing<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.130> I'm

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
this so right now what I'm doing is I'm

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.980 
this so right now what I'm doing is I'm
just<00:02:02.550> cutting<00:02:02.820> where<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> made<00:02:03.690> those<00:02:03.900> lines

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
just cutting where I made those lines

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.180 
just cutting where I made those lines
and<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.080> part<00:02:07.380> may<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.070> more

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and this part may be a little bit more

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.980 
and this part may be a little bit more
tricky<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.880> if<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> have<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:09.750> sharp

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
tricky so if you have really sharp

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.449 
tricky so if you have really sharp
scissors<00:02:10.350> that'll<00:02:10.649> help<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.920> lot<00:02:11.100> because<00:02:11.250> this

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
scissors that'll help a lot because this

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.960 
scissors that'll help a lot because this
part<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.820> be<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:12.209> difficult<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.600> do<00:02:12.750> so

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
it's going to continue to get gradually

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.130 
it's going to continue to get gradually
lighter<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.610> lighter<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.150> once<00:04:14.959> you've

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
lighter and lighter so once you've

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.630 
lighter and lighter so once you've

reached your desired look and I really

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
recommend cleaning it off with cold

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:27.730 
recommend cleaning it off with cold
water<00:04:25.300> after<00:04:26.300> you're<00:04:26.540> done<00:04:26.630> rinsing<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.620> need

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
water after you're done rinsing you need

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.010 
water after you're done rinsing you need
to<00:04:27.830> use<00:04:28.070> some<00:04:28.340> vinegar<00:04:29.270> white<00:04:29.660> vinegar<00:04:29.720> oil

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
to use some vinegar white vinegar oil

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
anything that has been a granite because

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.940 
anything that has been a granite because
vinegar<00:04:32.120> is<00:04:32.510> gonna<00:04:32.690> stop<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.320> process<00:04:33.770> as

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950

well<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:35.030> also<00:04:35.090> gonna<00:04:35.360> prevent<00:04:35.750> from

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
well and it's also gonna prevent from

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.440 
well and it's also gonna prevent from
yellowing<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.250> just<00:04:37.790> apply<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.090> on<00:04:38.390> the
