of<00:00:51.659> the<00:00:52.589> Scotsman<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> me<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.239> difficult

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
of the Scotsman and me is not difficult

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.169 
of the Scotsman and me is not difficult
to<00:00:55.319> get<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> fire<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.339> a<00:00:56.429> Scotsman<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.089> know

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.250 
to get that fire of a Scotsman you know
I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.359> it's<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.809> our<00:00:57.960> blood

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the Spartans and it really I think it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.359 
the Spartans and it really I think it

power<00:01:20.280> yes<00:01:21.030> yeah<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.979> actual

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
power yes yeah there was but an actual

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.959 
power yes yeah there was but an actual
fact<00:01:23.789> that<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.509> difficult<00:01:25.820> part<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
fact that was not a difficult part of

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.149 
fact that was not a difficult part of
the<00:01:27.090> film<00:01:27.329> because<00:01:27.689> when<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> knew<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:28.979> all

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the film because when we knew it was all

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.670 
the film because when we knew it was all
green<00:01:29.399> screen<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.930> whole<00:01:31.079> place<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.350> just

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
green screen the whole place is just

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
green screen the whole place is just
covered<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.070> green<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.270> blue

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
covered in green that actually was blue

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.819 
covered in green that actually was blue
um<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.969> it<00:01:36.240> doesn't<00:01:36.479> require<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.409> lot

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
um and and so it doesn't require a lot

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.709 
um and and so it doesn't require a lot
of<00:01:37.859> extra<00:01:38.250> work<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.299> old<00:01:39.420> days

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
of extra work and not like the old days

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.499 
of extra work and not like the old days
or<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.289> film<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.590> had<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.100> scene<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:42.210> was

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
or if a film just had one scene it was

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.529 
or if a film just had one scene it was
such<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:42.960> long<00:01:43.350> process<00:01:43.789> there<00:01:44.789> was<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.359> was

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
such a long process there was there was

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.899 
such a long process there was there was
um<00:01:45.929> they<00:01:46.740> weren't<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.039> any<00:01:47.189> holdups<00:01:47.670> for

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
um they weren't really any holdups for

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.279 
um they weren't really any holdups for
that<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.359> was<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> same<00:01:49.020> studio

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
that and it was all in the same studio

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.940 
that and it was all in the same studio
so<00:01:50.299> there<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> real<00:01:51.840> controlled<00:01:52.409> element

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
so there was a real controlled element

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.990 
so there was a real controlled element
and<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> thought<00:01:53.429> we<00:01:53.579> could<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.850> through

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and I thought we could get through

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.849 
and I thought we could get through
things<00:01:54.329> we<00:01:54.630> did<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.929> film<00:01:55.109> really<00:01:55.500> quickly

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
things we did this film really quickly

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.700 
things we did this film really quickly
like<00:01:56.310> 60<00:01:56.789> days<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.240> shot<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> Tony<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.619> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
like 60 days we shot it Tony when I was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.880 
like 60 days we shot it Tony when I was
8<00:01:58.859> weeks<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.249> training<00:01:59.609> I<00:01:59.999> think<00:02:00.840> oh<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.409> sorry

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
8 weeks of training I think oh I'm sorry

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580 
8 weeks of training I think oh I'm sorry
not<00:02:02.130> 8<00:02:02.280> weeks<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.670> 7<00:02:03.210> months<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.929> because

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
not 8 weeks now 7 months for me because

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.149 
not 8 weeks now 7 months for me because
just<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.990> yeah<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> mean<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.499> the<00:02:07.799> thing<00:02:07.829> I

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
just I yeah I mean that's the thing I

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.130 
just I yeah I mean that's the thing I
think<00:02:08.220> after<00:02:08.819> eight<00:02:09.209> weeks<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.899> could<00:02:10.050> have

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
think after eight weeks and I could have

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
think after eight weeks and I could have
got<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.379> pretty<00:02:10.560> good<00:02:10.739> shape<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.280> after<00:02:11.700> seven

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
got in pretty good shape but after seven

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
got in pretty good shape but after seven
months

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
months

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.790 
months
that's<00:02:13.140> how<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.470> get<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.050> did

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that's how you get like like I did

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's how you get like like I did
eventually<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.090> keep

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
eventually because you just keep

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.000 
eventually because you just keep
stepping<00:02:18.810> over<00:02:18.900> little<00:02:19.260> barriers<00:02:19.680> where<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
stepping over little barriers where you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.580 
stepping over little barriers where you
think<00:02:20.220> okay<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.730> would<00:02:21.690> honestly<00:02:21.840> think<00:02:22.290> right

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
think okay I would honestly think right

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.010 
think okay I would honestly think right
I<00:02:22.950> can't<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.300> great<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
I can't get this is great and then the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.450 
I can't get this is great and then the
next<00:02:25.230> minute<00:02:25.350> you'd<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.740> like<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.040> while<00:02:26.250> if

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
next minute you'd be like a while if

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.330 
next minute you'd be like a while if
surpass<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.160> then<00:02:29.160> you're

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
surpass that and and and then you're

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
surpass that and and and then you're
enjoying<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> because<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.240> will
