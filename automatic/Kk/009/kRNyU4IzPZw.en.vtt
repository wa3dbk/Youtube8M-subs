 made by hand 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.399
 then the material is fed to the crusher 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.620
 in this installation used the latest 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.139
 development of compact crushers 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.419
 this series 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
 in combination with rickz my scream 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.289
 this is a new generation of crushers unlike 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.069
 traditional crushers 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.619
 has the following form 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.739
 special properties 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.609
 feed material is produced 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.609
 evenly with a screw conveyor 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.389
 special benefits 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.649
 thanks to the large drive 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.749
 crusher is capable of automatically 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:08.819
 convert 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.909
 more material 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.359
 and special economy 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.369
 increased productivity 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.399
 from fifty get this ten percent 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.469
 reduction of energy costs 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.899
 from 30 ti 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.439
 up to fifty percent 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.439
 and significantly less parts costs 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.689
 crushing my map division 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.979
 all in one compact for years 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.829
 this is a distinctive feature of installations 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.480
 and new technology 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.809
 developed by the company scherba marked haim 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:48.319
 separation from sinking fractions ot floating 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.759
 happens in separator 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.669
 containers 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.399
 after separation 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.039
 in this setup both factions come on 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.569
 further processing 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.629
 separated because the usa fraction is exposed 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.219
 mechanical drying 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.819
 at which adele al shabab machine and 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.819
 mud impurities 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.359
 the floating fraction of ocher will be afraid and 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.090
 went kavun conveyor also served in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.090
 mechanical dryer 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.939
 special advantage hr be the concert 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.229
 separation of materials in the tank 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.240
 float method 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.169
 it is possible to complete even further 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.529
 efficient separation method 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.429
 hydroclones separation 

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:37.689
 by step 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.709
 at which the separation occurs 

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.860
 heavy fractions such as stones or 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.840
 aluminum 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.370
 and also achieved 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.889
 more thorough resettlement palestra and 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.889
 olefin field 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.110
 on the stage hydrocyclones new 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.080
 separation 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.349
 more accurate separation occurs 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.279
 of materials 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.129
 compared to stepped 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.129
 systems 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.529
 air separator 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.129
 the remnants of the film and dust are separated 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.349
 palaestra 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.899
 upon completion of this technological 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:15.379
 process 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.639
 of course the product 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.520
 loaded into the corresponding 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.659
 containers 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.669
 dry and clean cereal match 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.089
 specified specifications 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.139
 for the concept of august new 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.780
 offers a wide range of options and 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.849
 optimal options 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.319
 based on modular structure of installations 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.979
 there is the possibility of their further 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.979
 extensions and optimizations 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.249
 this is our principle 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.669
 simple structures for solving simple 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:48.740
 tasks 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.559
 complex structure 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.779
 to solve complex problems 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.360
 like here for example 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.419
 you see lp zil hot washing 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.369
 result 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.379
 will always fit 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.469
 specified parameters of the final product 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.460
 xr botnet firm firm 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.280
 also supplies installations for 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.499
 recycling and washing films 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.339
 and many other wastes from 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.059
 synthetic materials 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.079
 which are usable as 

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:18.169
 secondary raw materials 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.520
 longevity 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.250
 high efficiency and 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.759
 economy 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.619
 this disable has the features of equipment
