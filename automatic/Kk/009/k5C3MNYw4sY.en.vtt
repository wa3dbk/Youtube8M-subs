00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:08.660
 showered shadows and concealer was given to us 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.390
 natural shadow formation in the area 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.720
 that is, it is an area of ​​dark circles under 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.720

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.920
 to align the complexion applied 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.200
 tonal cream I usually use sponge 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970
 for applying foundation but in 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.540
 this case is not necessary 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.640
 since the deluxe series concealer 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.700
 which i use now 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.530
 perfectly distributed on the skin and its 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.530
 very easy to carry with 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:06.430
 We fix the makeup in the game and emphasize 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.710
 lower lash line 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:19.570
 by about one third it will give 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:22.600
 expressive look twisted 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.230
 cilia and mascara I will 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.510

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.430

 while trying it and wash it in the winter and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.270
 in the fall I always wear two kinds of mascara 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.040
 because these are the seasons when 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:52.150
 ordinary mascara can not take 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.730
 certain weather conditions 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.129
