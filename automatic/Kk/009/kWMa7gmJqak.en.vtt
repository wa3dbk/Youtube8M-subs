00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
so that's part of the thing I just tell

so that's part of the thing I just tell
you<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.659> few<00:00:04.170> little<00:00:04.350> other<00:00:04.799> tidbits<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
you a few little other tidbits about the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.310 
you a few little other tidbits about the
biology<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.740> depression<00:00:08.630> one<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
biology of depression one is that the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.890 
biology of depression one is that the
press<00:00:10.559> people<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.780> he<00:00:12.990> don't<00:00:13.259> they

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
press people have and he don't they

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
press people have and he don't they
really<00:00:15.900> were<00:00:16.410> certainly<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> severely

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
really were certainly the severely

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.779 
really were certainly the severely
depressed<00:00:18.240> people<00:00:18.529> have<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> problem<00:00:19.949> enjoying

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
depressed people have a problem enjoying

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.420 
depressed people have a problem enjoying
anything<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.680> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> say<00:00:23.070> there's<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
anything and you can say there's a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.089 
anything and you can say there's a
biological<00:00:24.210> basis<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.199> other<00:00:25.500> social

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
biological basis to that other social

biological basis to that other social
psychological<00:00:26.670> basis<00:00:27.619> now<00:00:29.330> these

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
psychological basis now these

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.900 
psychological basis now these
individuals<00:00:31.289> who<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.219> anhedonia<00:00:33.770> at<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.280> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
individuals who have anhedonia at a very

individuals who have anhedonia at a very

primitive level have what we call the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.200 
primitive level have what we call the
cognitive<00:00:39.540> blockade<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
cognitive blockade and that is that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.020 
cognitive blockade and that is that
positive<00:00:42.899> experiences<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.610> flat

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
see negative things to a very extreme

a psychological and a biological aspect
now<00:02:21.400> when<00:02:22.400> we<00:02:22.610> start<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.060> work

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
now when we start to work

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.400 
now when we start to work
therapeutically<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:25.570> can<00:02:26.570> reverse<00:02:26.990> the

therapeutically we can reverse the

therapeutically we can reverse the

with<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.270> core<00:02:32.510> beliefs<00:02:32.990> over<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
with the core beliefs over the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.310 
with the core beliefs over the
conditional<00:02:34.250> beliefs<00:02:34.640> or<00:02:35.150> given<00:02:35.780> appropriate

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
conditional beliefs or given appropriate

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.980 
conditional beliefs or given appropriate
experiences<00:02:37.250> however<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.820> comes<00:02:38.300> about<00:02:38.570> when

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
experiences however it comes about when

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.830 
experiences however it comes about when
their<00:02:39.680> beliefs<00:02:40.070> change<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.450> negative

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
their beliefs change then the negative

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.740 
their beliefs change then the negative
cognitive<00:02:42.230> bias<00:02:42.590> changes<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.550> they<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.570> then

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
cognitive bias changes and they can then

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.890 
cognitive bias changes and they can then
show<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.070> subliminal<00:02:46.700> level<00:02:47.030> these

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
show that at the subliminal level these

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.880 
show that at the subliminal level these
people<00:02:48.410> who<00:02:48.680> had<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.930> hypersensitive<00:02:50.930> amygdala

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
people who had a hypersensitive amygdala

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.030 
people who had a hypersensitive amygdala
previously<00:02:52.610> now<00:02:53.330> have<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> normal<00:02:54.040> magdalene

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
previously now have a normal magdalene

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640 
previously now have a normal magdalene
and<00:02:55.209> they're<00:02:56.209> able<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.720> see<00:02:56.990> negative<00:02:57.260> they're

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
and they're able to see negative they're

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.500 
and they're able to see negative they're
able<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.920> see<00:02:58.160> positive<00:02:58.760> things<00:02:59.080> and<00:03:00.340> their

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
able to see positive things and their

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.820 
able to see positive things and their
reactivity<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.959> negative<00:03:03.320> things<00:03:03.590> is

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
reactivity to negative things is

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.920 
reactivity to negative things is
diminished<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.209> here<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.480> have<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.660> nice

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
diminished so here you have a nice

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.400 
diminished so here you have a nice
picture<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.730> puts<00:03:07.970> together<00:03:08.209> glow<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.260> the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
picture that puts together glow of the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.040 
picture that puts together glow of the
biological<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.430> psychological<00:03:11.050> components

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
biological and psychological components

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.940 
biological and psychological components
and<00:03:12.850> this<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.080> recovery<00:03:15.080> recent<00:03:15.530> stuff<00:03:15.769> we

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
and this is recovery recent stuff we

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.259 
and this is recovery recent stuff we
just<00:03:16.190> wrote<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:17.560> 2011<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.880> that's<00:03:20.090> how

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
just wrote this up in 2011 so that's how

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.600 
just wrote this up in 2011 so that's how
recent<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:22.190> material<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:23.290> now<00:03:24.290> how<00:03:25.130> come

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
recent this material is now how come

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.009 
recent this material is now how come
it's<00:03:25.790> all<00:03:26.000> come<00:03:26.300> about<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.709> recently<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:29.019> part

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
it's all come about so recently a part

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.350 
it's all come about so recently a part
of<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.350> technology<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.700> technology

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
of it is technology is the technology

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.420 
of it is technology is the technology
wasn't<00:03:32.660> present<00:03:33.140> before<00:03:33.320> but<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.280> other

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
wasn't present before but the other

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.949 
wasn't present before but the other
thing<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:34.760> interesting<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.750> neuro

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
thing that's interesting is the neuro

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.170 
thing that's interesting is the neuro
scientists<00:03:36.860> who've<00:03:37.070> done<00:03:37.280> all<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:38.000> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
scientists who've done all of the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.080 
scientists who've done all of the
biological<00:03:38.690> stuff<00:03:39.560> private<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.340> myself<00:03:40.880> but

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
biological stuff private of myself but

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.810 
biological stuff private of myself but
they've<00:03:41.269> done<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:42.250> when<00:03:43.250> looking<00:03:43.489> for

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
they've done that when looking for

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.090 
they've done that when looking for
something<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.269> correlate<00:03:45.049> their<00:03:45.650> brain

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
something to correlate their brain

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.789 
something to correlate their brain
findings<00:03:46.730> with<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:48.170> only<00:03:48.410> thing<00:03:48.500> they

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
findings with and the only thing they

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.890 
findings with and the only thing they
could<00:03:48.860> find<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.670> made<00:03:49.910> sense<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.330> them<00:03:50.570> was

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
could find that made sense to them was

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.430 
could find that made sense to them was
the<00:03:51.140> cognitive<00:03:51.709> model<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.959> thing's

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
the cognitive model and so this thing's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.860 
the cognitive model and so this thing's
the<00:03:54.560> biologists<00:03:55.489> have<00:03:55.610> now<00:03:55.790> seized<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.720> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
the biologists have now seized on to the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.110 
the biologists have now seized on to the
target<00:03:57.200> model<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:58.040> would<00:03:58.400> say<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.640> they

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
target model and I would say that they

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.380 
target model and I would say that they
accepted<00:03:59.690> far<00:03:59.900> more<00:04:00.170> than<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:01.390> psychiatrists

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
accepted far more than and psychiatrists

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.960 
accepted far more than and psychiatrists
do<00:04:02.650> people<00:04:03.650> right<00:04:03.890> in<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> field<00:04:04.370> it's<00:04:04.640> kind

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
do people right in the field it's kind

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
do people right in the field it's kind
of<00:04:05.000> an<00:04:05.090> interesting<00:04:05.470> observation<00:04:09.040> okay

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
of an interesting observation okay

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
of an interesting observation okay
that's<00:04:10.280> all<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.610> know<00:04:10.670> about<00:04:10.910> that

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
that's all I know about that

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.120 
that's all I know about that
