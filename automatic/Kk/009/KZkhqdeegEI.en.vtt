00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello estimates of children another among hotel sun de punta is a signal points 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.230
 l 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.440
 from this class to some next we will dedicate ourselves to study the 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.679
 ideas variations between specific both the inoculation 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.869
 could therefore connect to a meaningless generality to what the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.869
 dipstick 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.460
 after another that define what is the weakness go day means 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.939
 simply changes 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.430
 changes that can be favorable or unfavorable because they may not have 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.720
 no relevance 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.300
 there more time see two puppies after asking 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.930
 one black and one color 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.420
 percent coffee 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240
 that does not have any 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.140
 difference to organize that if only the color of your coat 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.560
 What can be 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.700
 unfavorable valme where they can live or unfavorable 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 we have to understand what genotype means I did the type to be able to speak 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.220
 of the generation of variability in the characteristics of the organism 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.840
 no reason is defined as all the material exposes genetic information 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.989
 who owns the organism to his cell phone 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.390
 while the phenotype is the expression of this genotype 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.330
 and what I can not only observe at the level of the organism 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 for example here we can save a karyotype that the image of all 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.640
 chromosomes that an organism possesses 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340
 and here we can see 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.700
 a flower work whose genotype expression consists of a petal 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940
 certain shape of a certain color 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.630
 and a certain sex that is very important and has motivation 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.320
 changes still move away from the genotype 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 affect the phenotype and that will drive the variability 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.670
 moon adjudge criticism that we had already talked about is sex and sex of origin 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.500
 of sex 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.850
 It is a clear example of dignity 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.460
 within which one of the chromosomes is thought to be the chromosome ti 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 sexual 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.080
 suffered an important choice from part of their area generate centrosome 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.440
 quite small 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.110
 the acquisition of sex chromosomes that are capable of coding an apparatus 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.930
 to be able to carry out a reproduction between the tunnel itself 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.700
 species 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.990
 but different by the same sanatorium 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.910
 assures the species that all parents are going to have a sector 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.009
 variability with respect to the previous ones 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.219
 therefore this variability 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.089
 there is a high probability that it is favorable for the adaptation of 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.089
 future generations almengor poniente 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.579
 another clear generation of variability are the girdle 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.139
 the races as we saw also with the photo of the mat 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 we can save the human eye that exist in the past 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:39.189
 per cent with lighter white skin and hair and so it happens that they have skin 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.849
 dark defined on the basis of the environment where and ventilated performance at 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.459
 solar penances 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.459
 and eye and other factors that can alter 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.279
 in the intentions of certain nutrients in the body 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.670
 remember that for the synthesis of vitamin D rays are required 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.669
 ultraviolet in a certain amount 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:04.059
 bricks and xix we said that in a generating process of Morelia 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.039
 variability between pc 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.669
 and it is very important because in the end variability within the same species 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.399
 it is not necessary to be quiet of different species of not running 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.869
 to see if there is a possibility of generating a species 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.619
 then to the general the gametes whatever you touch me and gender has a load 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.869
 genetics different from the parent 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.180
 and when merging with him 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.050
 the corresponding gamete will generate an organism 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.599
 a load different from the parent 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.669
 and in some cases it can be generated instead as votes 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.299
 the equipment that the agency seeks favorable with respect to its environment 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.729
 natural they were loading 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.099
 will be charged to eliminate that half ossa on me 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.099
 however in most cases that this variability 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.869
 generates a favorable change as in the disappearance of the wisdom tooth 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.609
 because they have been allowed to slide 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.839
 pmz level 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:58.930
 the mutations as we have said are defined as changes in the information 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:59.560
 genetics 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.760
 can be favorable as the favorable CP are not always unfavorable 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.599
 you have to remember that 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.629
 an agent who 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.870
 it is very common for it to cause mutation in general aniel of the rise to pronounce 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.979
 said chemical foster excess or physical factors like chemical jc radiation 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.840
 promote that only by him the time change denver nuggets 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.620
 it was changing in the structure of the protein that can in sixth function 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.009
 and with that the organism may have 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.659
 yahoo a protein deficit with a good new one that has a 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.770
 specific function 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.830
 remember that genes are defined as dn sequences 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.009
 within the nh code for one more protein 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.059
 and when changing 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.020
 an age of the letters that make up this genetic message we are changing all 

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:50.180
 the chain that follows below 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.729
 reproduce it reproduction pays attention to 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.139
 we have to also remember 7 is to simply clone the organism to 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.789
 that accepts to be the population 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.809
 does not have the ability of intel species variability but for 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.180
 required to generate an idea is required to incorporate factors 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.479
 extrinsic like the plasmids 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.569
 which are the segment of lines of another organism that are in the middle 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.820
 that genetic information can be integrated 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.640
 and with that generate new species for example the resistance a certain 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.640
 warm tito 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.150
 finally to study the frequency of certain characteristics no balls in 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.950
 determined 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.039
 we fire 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:28.930
 use 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.180
 this graphic 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.200
 which sets the data different figures proportionality of 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.469
 characters we have characteristics 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.999
 as it is dominant 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.229
 which means that both the two characteristics 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.389
 picture the two chromosomes that have this characteristic 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.389
 they will always grow that feature in the presence of another 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.879
 we have faith in the recessive hows and bikes 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.460
 that are are implacable with the dominant 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.919
 and we have the musketeers and vote 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.439
 mix of characters 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.599
 tom hooper who the population in general 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.490
 there is very little frequency 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.979
 I feel if the fetus of some and vote is Sunday dominator recession 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.139
 but nevertheless 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.020
 there spoke with approximately 50% of the population possesses character that 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.969
 but I'm still an author 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.690
 and this exclusion or very important natural 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.210
 and live affirms format a feature called gauss bell 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.909
 that the distribution that never 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.999
 the extremes of the curve predominate but in the middle of the curve ep the 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.650
 greater number of population d 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.220
 and this means that the mix of population characteristics are 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.159
 the most abundant 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.470
 good guys that that is the delivery today we hope it was from 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.820
 its usefulness and help 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.240
 Any doubt visit the page mount national points of difference of 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.960
 material to go with another project that not only for his mother
