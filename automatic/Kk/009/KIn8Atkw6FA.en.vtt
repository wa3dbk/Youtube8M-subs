next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.960 
next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add
a<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> pomegranate<00:00:44.190> juice<00:00:44.220> just<00:00:44.699> so<00:00:44.850> you

a bit of pomegranate juice just so you
can<00:00:45.150> see<00:00:45.619> visually<00:00:46.619> what<00:00:46.799> I'm<00:00:47.059> doing<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.330> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
can see visually what I'm doing here the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.259 
can see visually what I'm doing here the
art<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> shaking<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.159> to<00:00:50.339> get<00:00:50.519> all<00:00:50.729> the<00:00:50.760> liquid

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
art of shaking is to get all the liquid

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.810 
art of shaking is to get all the liquid
and<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.750> ice<00:00:52.010> touching<00:00:53.010> every<00:00:53.460> single

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and all the ice touching every single

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.969 
and all the ice touching every single
part<00:00:54.150> of<00:00:54.449> whichever<00:00:55.199> container<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:55.949> using

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
part of whichever container you're using

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.880 
part of whichever container you're using
you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.720> maximum<00:00:58.140> chill<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.830> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you want to have maximum chill and a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
you want to have maximum chill and a
little<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.369> dilution<00:00:59.729> too<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.510> needs

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
little bit of dilution too so this needs

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.950 
little bit of dilution too so this needs
to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.900> hard<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.619> a<00:01:02.010> fast<00:01:02.309> shake<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> with

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to be hard and a fast shake do it with

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
to be hard and a fast shake do it with
gusto<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.360> ten

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
gusto and you know do this for about ten

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.219 
gusto and you know do this for about ten
seconds<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:14.509> then<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
seconds and then you can see there's a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
seconds and then you can see there's a
couple<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> things<00:01:16.649> I<00:01:16.859> can<00:01:17.039> feel<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> that's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
couple of things I can feel that that's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
couple of things I can feel that that's
nice<00:01:17.969> and<00:01:18.210> cold<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.289> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.619> see

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
nice and cold in there and you can see

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
nice and cold in there and you can see
that<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.280> beautiful<00:01:20.670> foamy

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that it's got this beautiful foamy

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
that it's got this beautiful foamy
finish<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.350> nice<00:01:23.100> texture<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.729> all

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
finish to it a nice texture and all

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.340 
finish to it a nice texture and all
everything<00:01:24.359> is<00:01:24.450> bound<00:01:24.689> together

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
everything is bound together

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.249 
everything is bound together
that's<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.249> cocks<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.609> ready<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.259> you'd

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that's the cocks are ready to go you'd

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.739 
that's the cocks are ready to go you'd
be<00:01:28.409> straining<00:01:28.859> this<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.789> preferred

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
be straining this into your preferred

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:33.080 
be straining this into your preferred
glass<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> cocktail<00:01:31.740> glass<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.429> if

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
glass this is a cocktail glass and if

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.029 
glass this is a cocktail glass and if
it's<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.359> single<00:01:33.659> strain<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.469> I'm<00:01:34.590> doing<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
it's a single strain all I'm doing is

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.569 
it's a single strain all I'm doing is
holding<00:01:35.490> back<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.359> rocks<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.409> ice<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> can

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
holding back the rocks of ice so I can

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
holding back the rocks of ice so I can
use<00:01:39.329> both<00:01:39.539> hands<00:01:39.899> just<00:01:40.319> open<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:40.770> up

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
use both hands just open this up

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
use both hands just open this up
slightly<00:01:41.249> or<00:01:41.969> you<00:01:42.030> could<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.359> a<00:01:42.390> spoon<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
slightly or you could use a spoon to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
slightly or you could use a spoon to
hold<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> ice<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> allow<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> liquid

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
hold the ice back and allow the liquid

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
hold the ice back and allow the liquid
to<00:01:45.899> pour<00:01:46.530> freely<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.520> glass<00:01:49.579> with<00:01:50.579> all

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
to pour freely into the glass with all

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.830 
to pour freely into the glass with all
that<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.359> you<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.630 

ensuring<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.960> get<00:01:56.140> every<00:01:57.130> last<00:01:57.340> drop<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:59.640> if

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
ensuring you get every last drop and if

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.090 
ensuring you get every last drop and if
it<00:02:00.789> stipulates<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.570> fine<00:02:01.899> strain<00:02:02.380> or<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.649> double

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
it stipulates a fine strain or a double

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.270 
it stipulates a fine strain or a double
strain<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:04.960> introduce<00:02:05.619> one

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
strain you're then gonna introduce one

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.800 
strain you're then gonna introduce one
of<00:02:06.310> these<00:02:06.520> tea<00:02:06.789> strainers<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.569> will<00:02:07.689> go

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
of these tea strainers and that will go

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.109 
of these tea strainers and that will go
in<00:02:07.990> between<00:02:08.019> your<00:02:08.979> shaker<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.700> your<00:02:09.849> glass

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
in between your shaker and your glass

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.570 
in between your shaker and your glass
and<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:11.140> will<00:02:11.290> capture<00:02:11.530> any<00:02:11.860> bits<00:02:12.129> of<00:02:12.280> pith

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and that will capture any bits of pith

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.020 
and that will capture any bits of pith
or<00:02:12.940> seeds<00:02:13.330> or<00:02:13.690> broken<00:02:14.260> ice<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.700> gone<00:02:15.879> into

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
or seeds or broken ice have gone into

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.150 
or seeds or broken ice have gone into
the<00:02:16.239> drink<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.349> fine<00:02:17.590> strain<00:02:17.980> that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the drink so that's a fine strain that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.400 
the drink so that's a fine strain that
was<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> single<00:02:18.700> strain<00:02:18.940> that's<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.810> easy<00:02:20.080> way

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
was a single strain that's the easy way
