invented<00:01:19.750> my<00:01:20.140> invention<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.679> wheel<00:01:20.979> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
invented my invention is the wheel I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.800 
invented my invention is the wheel I
invented<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.310> wheels<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.850> change<00:01:25.090> they're

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
invented the wheels of change they're

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.660 
invented the wheels of change they're
exactly<00:01:26.440> what<00:01:26.649> America<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.159> looking<00:01:27.490> for

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
exactly what America is looking for

right now and I'm proud of them would I
find<00:01:31.000> any<00:01:31.179> kind<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.539> wheels<00:01:31.750> competitive<00:01:32.409> to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
find any kind of wheels competitive to

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.090 
find any kind of wheels competitive to
those<00:01:32.679> wheels

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
those wheels

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.669 
those wheels
I<00:01:33.220> am<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.240> competition<00:01:34.929> no<00:01:35.080> seriously

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
I am the competition no seriously

I am the competition no seriously
honestly<00:01:36.190> enough<00:01:36.460> with<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:37.030> there<00:01:37.270> any

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
honestly enough with that is there any

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.490 
honestly enough with that is there any
other<00:01:37.539> wheels<00:01:37.810> out<00:01:38.050> there<00:01:38.259> there<00:01:38.380> they're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
other wheels out there there they're

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200 
other wheels out there there they're
shaped<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:39.009> they're<00:01:39.340> nothing<00:01:39.550> like<00:01:39.909> them<00:01:40.090> no

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
shaped like they're nothing like them no

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.669 
shaped like they're nothing like them no
other<00:01:40.360> wheels<00:01:40.600> yeah<00:01:40.750> there<00:01:41.080> are<00:01:41.229> wheels<00:01:41.470> that

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
other wheels yeah there are wheels that

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.020 
other wheels yeah there are wheels that
are<00:01:41.800> shaped<00:01:41.979> like<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.399> but<00:01:42.550> they<00:01:42.610> don't<00:01:42.759> do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
are shaped like that but they don't do

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.460 
are shaped like that but they don't do
what<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:43.360> wheel<00:01:43.569> does<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:44.020> wheel<00:01:44.229> has<00:01:44.440> a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
what this wheel does this wheel has a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.710 
what this wheel does this wheel has a
subliminal<00:01:45.130> safety<00:01:45.580> signal<00:01:45.940> built<00:01:46.179> into<00:01:46.569> it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
subliminal safety signal built into it

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.749 
subliminal safety signal built into it
when<00:01:47.259> this<00:01:47.380> bike<00:01:47.560> stops<00:01:47.950> those<00:01:48.250> wheels<00:01:48.490> keep

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
when this bike stops those wheels keep

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.190 
when this bike stops those wheels keep
spinning<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:49.270> send<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.569> message<00:01:49.899> out<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.080> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
spinning to send a message out to the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.020 
spinning to send a message out to the
environment<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.799> be<00:01:51.039> safe<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.489> the<00:01:51.580> road<00:01:51.759> okay

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
environment to be safe on the road okay

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.029 
environment to be safe on the road okay
so<00:01:52.509> you've<00:01:52.899> invented<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.410> wheel<00:01:53.590> hub<00:01:53.770> cap

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
so you've invented a wheel hub cap

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.100 
so you've invented a wheel hub cap
absolutely<00:01:55.000> you've<00:01:55.300> confirmed<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.899> me<00:01:55.989> you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
absolutely you've confirmed to me you

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.020 
absolutely you've confirmed to me you
are<00:01:56.259> crazy<00:01:56.560> I'm<00:01:56.830> crazy<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.489> think<00:01:57.759> it's<00:01:57.879> time<00:01:57.970> to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
are crazy I'm crazy I think it's time to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.810 
are crazy I'm crazy I think it's time to
voters<00:01:58.390> vote

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820
