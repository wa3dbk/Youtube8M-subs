00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
you
to<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.320> honest<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.430> greatly<00:00:41.760> depends<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
to be honest this greatly depends on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
to be honest this greatly depends on the
TV<00:00:42.990> size<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.890> component<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.730> went<00:00:44.910> bust<00:00:45.150> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
TV size the component that went bust and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
TV size the component that went bust and
obviously<00:00:45.900> if<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.560> is<00:00:46.590> still<00:00:46.980> covered<00:00:47.400> by

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
obviously if it is still covered by

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
obviously if it is still covered by
warranty<00:00:47.790> if<00:00:48.330> the<00:00:49.050> warranty<00:00:49.500> still<00:00:49.830> covers<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
warranty if the warranty still covers it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
warranty if the warranty still covers it
then<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.060> is<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> no-brainer<00:00:51.480> since<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.230> can

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
then it is a no-brainer since you can

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
then it is a no-brainer since you can
either<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.130> repaired<00:00:53.580> or<00:00:53.790> even<00:00:54.120> replaced

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
either have it repaired or even replaced

either have it repaired or even replaced
this<00:00:55.320> greatly<00:00:55.680> depends<00:00:56.310> on<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> manufacturer

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
