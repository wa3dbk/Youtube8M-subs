top part and a bottom part so I can keep

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.599 
top part and a bottom part so I can keep
more<00:00:14.340> coils<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.509> more<00:00:15.690> space<00:00:16.070> each<00:00:17.070> door

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
more coils and have more space each door

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.599 
more coils and have more space each door
has<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.449> little<00:00:18.900> latch<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> can

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
has a little latch on it that you can

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.089 
has a little latch on it that you can
open<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.180> close<00:00:22.100> and<00:00:23.990> we<00:00:24.990> painted<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> even

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
open and close and we painted this even

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.950 
open and close and we painted this even
though<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.279> doesn't<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:26.580> painted<00:00:27.150> we

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
though it doesn't look painted we

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310 
though it doesn't look painted we
painted<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> brown<00:00:29.099> color<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.480> it's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
painted this a brown color and it's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
painted this a brown color and it's
supposed<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.859> keep<00:00:32.070> water<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> woods

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
supposed to keep water out of the woods

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720 
supposed to keep water out of the woods
so<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.390> doesn't<00:00:33.780> warp<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.340> might<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so it doesn't warp but we might have to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.950 
so it doesn't warp but we might have to
paint<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.149> again<00:00:36.239> soon

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
paint it again soon

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
paint it again soon
so<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:40.610> stapled<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.800> wire<00:00:43.800> mesh<00:00:44.210> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so we stapled all of the wire mesh to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.619 
so we stapled all of the wire mesh to
each<00:00:45.600> side<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.770> secure<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.370> rats<00:00:48.090> don't<00:00:48.390> get

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
each side very secure so rats don't get

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.160 
each side very secure so rats don't get
in<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.460> raccoons<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> made<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in or raccoons don't get in and made it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.420 
in or raccoons don't get in and made it
very<00:00:52.559> sturdy<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.449> if<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:56.100> falls

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
very sturdy and if one if a one falls

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.970 
very sturdy and if one if a one falls
off<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.899> restate<00:00:58.410> belit<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
off like here will restate belit and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.760 
off like here will restate belit and
make<00:00:59.910> sure<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.449> nothing<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
make sure that nothing can get in and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.120 
make sure that nothing can get in and
nothing<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.309> out<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.100> top<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:07.130> raise

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
nothing can get out the top can raise

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
nothing can get out the top can raise
like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.790> allows<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
like this here and this allows it so we

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
like this here and this allows it so we
can<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.640> stay<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.570> case<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.960> need

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
can it can stay up just in case I need

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
can it can stay up just in case I need
to<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.470> cleaning<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> take<00:01:17.520> something

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
to be cleaning or need to take something

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060 
to be cleaning or need to take something
in<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.240> out

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.690 

nothing<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.390> top<00:01:22.660> part<00:01:23.290> yet<00:01:23.770> because

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
nothing is in the top part yet because

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.960 
nothing is in the top part yet because
usually<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.450> top<00:01:25.660> part<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.050> for<00:01:26.290> when<00:01:26.970> my

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
usually the top part is for when my

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.650 
usually the top part is for when my
button<00:01:28.300> quails<00:01:28.600> have<00:01:29.880> babies<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.180> when<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
babies get old enough to get up out of

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.640 
babies get old enough to get up out of
the<00:01:33.700> brooder<00:01:34.030> they<00:01:34.180> go<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.480> here<00:01:34.510> but<00:01:35.470> right
