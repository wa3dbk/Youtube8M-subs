00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.540
 one of them 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.440
 Augustine Moreno Padilla in charge of the 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.840
 head of police and transit of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.770
 middle- zone state invited citizens 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.080
 to raise your motorcycle remembering that 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.779
 when you buy a motorcycle you 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.720
 has 15 days to complete the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.910
 Procedure 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.050
 and you can comment 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.170
 at a general level about 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.570
 the regulation in relation to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.180
 vehicles that are acquired new 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.780
 truth of agency in the case of the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.309
 propulsion motor vehicles can 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.769
 to be contemplated within the law 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.449
 that are 15 days those that are given to 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.940
 people so they can do the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.190
 process from their plates so that they 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.140
 can get from the plate and the card 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 of circulation in the case of 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.760
 unfortunately motorcycles 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.619
 many times we are omitted not 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.259
 we do this process in a timely manner 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.750
 what then originates a series 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.090
 of fines and surcharges true before the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 secretary of finance and then some 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 way at the moment that what 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.050
 intercepts any of the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.179
 different municipal authorities 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.520
 state or federal because they are 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.950
 reasons not breach the ballot 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 fact that they do not bring their plates or their 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 circulation cards 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.399
 then invite us to society 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.470
 in general so that they approach the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.159
 finance secretary and then they can 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.950
 do this process that is very important 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.229
 Moreno Padilla informed that the secretary 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.380
 of public security of the state is the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.719
 only authorized to issue permits 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.719
 to circulate without license plates or card 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.939
 circulation in the case of the address 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.759
 of public safety of the state now to 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.890
 transit through the department as 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.750
 effectively permits are issued for 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.179
 transit without license plates and cards 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.579
 circulation this based on the law of 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.950
 transit of the state and obviously it's a 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.340
 permission that has duration or validity of 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.989
 30 days and it has no replacement truth 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.180
 this is in the case of new vehicles 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.459
 as we already mentioned that they have 15 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.040
 days to plan in that inter 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.049
 make use of this permit or 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.480
 vehicles that have already been planned but 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.400
 that are written off then in what 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.099
 they do the following process also 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.170
 have that lapse or that opportunity to 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.970
 who can process your permission to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.329
 transit without license plates and card 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.190
 circulation before this institution 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.180
 obviously based on the law of 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.180
 State transit
