00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.269
 saved boys who come to you 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.980
 talk is today I'm back with a new one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.900
 commentaries today we are in live and we are up 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.570
 at least three and I decided that today you 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.859
 will talk order topic that anyway 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 sometimes I probably already have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.310
 treated so that they are al 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.000
 moment that occasionally comes from me 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 to deal 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 however, I noticed that still many more 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 people didn't understand my thinking 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 on this nice thing is the topic 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 of today and sensitivity 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.800
 what is it that I wanted to tell you in practice every 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 I often read these comments 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.000
 on youtube that talk about the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 sensitivity or not and aim to say maybe but 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.160
 lima contexts sensitivity see the wing 29 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.410
 to tease and I say I want to say 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.930
 but what the fuck is he saying 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 this is because for me sensitivity is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.859
 a thing of its own 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.379
 if you don't always shooter you don't need the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.809
 high sensitivity games with that in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.140
 which you are better at 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.299
 call of duty mainly use the 8 up 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.380
 3m v2 various cocks and while for black ops 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.030
 21 to 12 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.439
 when I'm tied with the a12 and a11 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 and in any case they are always a little better 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.040
 unbalanced balance with telling her how 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.820
 on me according to the others 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 tail and then on shock which is different for 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 I remember, however, having the same needle 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.790
 starlab and practically equal or seems co2 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.590
 on ghost I use the 16 if I'm not wrong club e 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 therefore twice the viii 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.860
 I made a kind of proportion and then 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.680
 the cola that is most suitable second 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.259
 me there is no use to have 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.689
 sensitivity 10 always in a fixed way 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.509
 because in the end what the fuck is needed 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.520
 that is, you still need to be able to 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.439
 take people without giving the shots 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.909
 maybe being able to do action then 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.399
 but too high sensitivity could 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.040
 disadvantage t as too much sensitivity 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.049
 low could disadvantage t in the sense that 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.619
 you will not be able to do certain certain things 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.930
 movements 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 I prefer youth in my throat 8 because I do 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.930
 ix e seems more balanced though 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.700
 I think it's okay 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.560
 la7 when you do a lot of a sad one 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.600
 a little more rural you can stay there 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.280
 so some of you I can think of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.690
 this thing and now we will try to do 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 some mini clips that I can't get to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.250
 then take a player's shock 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.250
