00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.790
 and make the eyeliner as you want 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.520
 thinner than you want and the most 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.960
 thick you want is fantastically 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.630
 a marvel 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.830

 I try there to make it like it is 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.780
 the most straight theo but as you can see it 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.850
 it comes out a little more than normal to that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.930
 follow much bigger 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.930
