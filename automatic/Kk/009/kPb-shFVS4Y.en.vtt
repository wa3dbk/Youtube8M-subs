00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
do a little more work yet because to get

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.950 
do a little more work yet because to get
to<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> subway<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:15.000> here<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.660> don't

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
to the subway it's right here I don't

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.290 
to the subway it's right here I don't
know<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.290> seems<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.680> i<00:02:17.100> don't<00:02:17.730> know<00:02:17.850> he<00:02:18.180> he

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
know it seems like i don't know he he

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.400 
know it seems like i don't know he he
does<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> good<00:02:18.900> job<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.590> house<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:22.260> me

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
does a good job on the house but to me

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.220 
does a good job on the house but to me
it<00:02:22.560> almost<00:02:22.650> seems<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.250> he<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:24.020> built<00:02:25.020> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it almost seems like he just built it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.840 
it almost seems like he just built it
exactly<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.830> same<00:02:25.920> way<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.490> then<00:02:26.610> really

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
exactly the same way and then really

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
exactly the same way and then really
incorporated<00:02:27.600> or<00:02:27.780> redo<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.350> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.650> thing

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
incorporated or redo it kind of thing

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.230 
incorporated or redo it kind of thing
i'm<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> person<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.820> know<00:02:29.940> what<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.150> had

i'm a person like you know what you had
a<00:02:30.270> cool<00:02:30.540> design<00:02:30.750> build<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.830> new<00:02:32.010> design<00:02:32.370> it

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
a cool design build a new design it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.220 
a cool design build a new design it
doesn't<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.030> exact<00:02:33.390> same<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:33.990> i

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
doesn't have to be exact same but i

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.470 
doesn't have to be exact same but i
don't<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.560> what<00:02:34.710> happened<00:02:35.070> here<00:02:35.270> i'll<00:02:36.270> leave

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that to the community to decide what

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.390 
that to the community to decide what
they're<00:02:38.040> doing<00:02:38.550> about<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.300> anyways

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
they're doing about that but anyways

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.740 
they're doing about that but anyways
here's<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.490> subway<00:02:41.910> terminal<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:42.600> know

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
here's a subway terminal we all know

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.300 
here's a subway terminal we all know
that<00:02:43.400> know<00:02:44.400> what<00:02:44.520> happens<00:02:44.850> not<00:02:45.720> too<00:02:45.870> bad<00:02:46.310> okay

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that know what happens not too bad okay

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.360 
that know what happens not too bad okay
so<00:02:47.690> I'm<00:02:48.690> pretty<00:02:49.350> much<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> almost<00:02:50.160> end

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
so I'm pretty much going to almost end

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.800 
so I'm pretty much going to almost end
this<00:02:50.430> year<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.820> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> check<00:02:51.209> one<00:02:51.540> plot

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
this year I'm going to check one plot

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.830 
this year I'm going to check one plot
because<00:02:52.459> apparently<00:02:53.459> somebody<00:02:53.970> cried<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.690> I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
because apparently somebody cried and I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.110 
because apparently somebody cried and I
don't<00:02:55.170> want<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> jerk<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.850> thought<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
don't want to be a jerk so I thought I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
don't want to be a jerk so I thought I
would<00:02:57.209> show<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.690> because<00:02:57.780> i<00:02:58.050> missed<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
would show it because i missed it in the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.680 
would show it because i missed it in the
north<00:02:58.800> i<00:02:59.070> don't<00:02:59.790> think<00:02:59.850> i'll<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.120> doing<00:03:00.420> any

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
north i don't think i'll be doing any

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.840 
north i don't think i'll be doing any
more<00:03:00.810> north<00:03:01.110> i<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.440> i'll<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.800> working<00:03:02.160> yeast

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
more north i think i'll be working yeast

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.980 
more north i think i'll be working yeast
next<00:03:05.180> unfortunately<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.270> whole<00:03:06.420> system<00:03:06.870> of

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
next unfortunately the whole system of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.320 
next unfortunately the whole system of
us<00:03:07.140> explorer<00:03:07.590> 8<00:03:07.850> exploration<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.180> is

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
us explorer 8 exploration like this is

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.470 
us explorer 8 exploration like this is
really<00:03:09.900> messed<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.459> once<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.850> it's<00:03:12.269> going<00:03:12.390> to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
really messed up once and it's going to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.140 
really messed up once and it's going to
be<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> hundred<00:03:12.750> times<00:03:12.989> better<00:03:13.260> once<00:03:14.130> oh<00:03:14.760> yeah<00:03:15.120> i

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
be a hundred times better once oh yeah i

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.220 
be a hundred times better once oh yeah i
was<00:03:15.330> going<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.480> add<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.630> mod<00:03:15.870> somebody

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
was going to add a mod somebody

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.600 
was going to add a mod somebody
suggested<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.739> there's<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.040> mod<00:03:17.310> where<00:03:17.519> you

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
suggested that there's a mod where you

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.220 
suggested that there's a mod where you
click<00:03:17.850> around<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.300> your<00:03:18.450> teleport<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.170> know

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
click around and your teleport I know

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.600 
click around and your teleport I know
the<00:03:19.470> mod<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.800> don't<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.160> link<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.489> or

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the mod you don't have to link it or

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.580 
the mod you don't have to link it or
anything<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.060> i'll<00:03:21.660> probably<00:03:21.900> add<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.350> into

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
anything but i'll probably add that into

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.949 
anything but i'll probably add that into
it<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.920> make<00:03:22.950> life<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.400> little<00:03:23.550> easier<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:24.540> what

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it to make life a little easier but what

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.470 
it to make life a little easier but what
i<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.230> i<00:03:25.320> may<00:03:25.530> also<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.730> make<00:03:26.850> life<00:03:27.330> a

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
i think i may also do is to make life a

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.360 
i think i may also do is to make life a
10<00:03:27.810> times<00:03:28.080> easier<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:29.180> offer<00:03:30.800> s<00:03:31.800> at<00:03:32.100> warp

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
10 times easier is offer s at warp

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.850 
10 times easier is offer s at warp
system<00:03:32.790> where<00:03:33.019> once<00:03:34.019> we<00:03:34.170> take<00:03:34.320> out<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> warp

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
system where once we take out the warp

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.470 
system where once we take out the warp
again<00:03:35.010> once<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.430> have<00:03:35.610> mine<00:03:35.820> carts<00:03:36.090> going<00:03:36.239> as

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
again once we have mine carts going as

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.530 
again once we have mine carts going as
such<00:03:36.980> i'll<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.610> people<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:39.030> set<00:03:39.239> warps

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
such i'll do it so people can set warps

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.090 
such i'll do it so people can set warps
and<00:03:39.660> i<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:39.959> warp<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.680> thing<00:03:40.890> and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
and i can warp to it kind of thing and
