for<00:01:06.990> us<00:01:07.049> patch<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.560> common<00:01:08.010> i<00:01:08.130> guess<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.610> i

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
for us patch that's common i guess but i

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
for us patch that's common i guess but i
might<00:01:09.570> even<00:01:09.720> end<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.080> getting<00:01:10.320> rid<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
might even end up getting rid of the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.789 
might even end up getting rid of the
mail<00:01:14.180> but<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.990> mean<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> guess<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> really

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
mail but what I mean I guess it really

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.840 
mail but what I mean I guess it really
don't<00:01:17.009> matter<00:01:17.130> cuz<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.490> look<00:01:17.640> identical

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
don't matter cuz they look identical

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
don't matter cuz they look identical
usually<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> keep<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> mail

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
usually if you want to keep the mail

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.760 
usually if you want to keep the mail
because<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.490> look<00:01:20.700> better<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.560> doesn't

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
because they look better but it doesn't

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.969
