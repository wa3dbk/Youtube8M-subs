00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
updated such gonna be kind of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.080 
updated such gonna be kind of
interesting<00:01:48.200> especially<00:01:48.920> with<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.640> phrase

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
interesting especially with the phrase

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.910 
interesting especially with the phrase
that<00:01:50.270> says<00:01:50.450> he<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.780> plunder<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.350> secrets<00:01:51.799> of

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
that says he can plunder the secrets of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.889 
that says he can plunder the secrets of
space<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.520> time<00:01:52.880> that's<00:01:53.539> really<00:01:53.749> interesting

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
space and time that's really interesting

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.560 
space and time that's really interesting
I<00:01:54.259> believe<00:01:54.590> he's<00:01:54.829> gonna<00:01:54.920> be<00:01:55.159> switching<00:01:55.579> when

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
I believe he's gonna be switching when

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.849 
I believe he's gonna be switching when
we<00:01:56.689> when<00:01:57.079> we<00:01:57.109> glitched<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:57.590> there<00:01:57.710> there's

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
we when we glitched in there there's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.200 
we when we glitched in there there's
gonna<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.159> different<00:01:58.369> there<00:01:58.700> was<00:01:58.729> different

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
gonna be different there was different

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.989 
gonna be different there was different
types<00:01:59.359> of<00:01:59.479> portals<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.409> do<00:02:00.530> say<00:02:00.859> I<00:02:01.130> do<00:02:01.280> figure

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
types of portals so I do say I do figure

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.639 
types of portals so I do say I do figure
out<00:02:02.060> where<00:02:02.359> it<00:02:02.509> says<00:02:02.719> he<00:02:02.929> can<00:02:03.109> plunder<00:02:03.439> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
out where it says he can plunder the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.469 
out where it says he can plunder the
secrets<00:02:04.009> of<00:02:04.100> space<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.429> time<00:02:04.549> that<00:02:05.060> means<00:02:05.270> a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
secrets of space of time that means a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.639 
secrets of space of time that means a
lot<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.749> things<00:02:05.840> are<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.229> be<00:02:06.350> either

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
lot of things are going to be either

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.400 
lot of things are going to be either
we're<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.249> teleporting<00:02:07.850> or

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
we're going to be teleporting or

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.180 
we're going to be teleporting or
something's<00:02:09.410> going<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.679> teleporting

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
something's going to be teleporting

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
something's going to be teleporting
through<00:02:10.340> all<00:02:10.460> those<00:02:10.610> gates<00:02:11.080> then<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.200> have<00:02:12.350> an

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
through all those gates then we have an

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.220 
through all those gates then we have an
army<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:13.130> wolves<00:02:13.580> track<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.390> house<00:02:14.540> levels<00:02:14.960> to

Fallen house of winter to his cause
there's<00:02:23.840> another<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.500> glitch<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.950> we

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
there's another one we glitch to we

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.560 
there's another one we glitch to we
clinched<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.210> well<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.620> one<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:29.000> looks<00:02:29.330> very

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
clinched as well this one it looks very

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.050 
clinched as well this one it looks very
a<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:30.020> bit<00:02:30.140> more<00:02:30.320> sophisticated<00:02:30.620> than<00:02:31.370> all

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
a little bit more sophisticated than all

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.730 
a little bit more sophisticated than all
of<00:02:32.240> them<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.720> vector<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.230> Exeter<00:02:33.590> that

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
of them but the vector of Exeter that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.320 
of them but the vector of Exeter that
one<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.980> really<00:02:34.190> really<00:02:34.400> good<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.150> is

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
one is really really good this is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.730 
one is really really good this is
actually<00:02:35.630> pretty<00:02:35.840> interesting<00:02:36.140> because<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
actually pretty interesting because it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.160 
actually pretty interesting because it
says<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.060> kill<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.660> wolf<00:02:38.870> pack

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
says you have to kill the wolf pack

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.100 
says you have to kill the wolf pack
before<00:02:39.470> their<00:02:40.160> kill<00:02:40.459> Scola's<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.750> rally<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
before their kill Scola's can rally the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.620 
before their kill Scola's can rally the
Fallen<00:02:42.500> house<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.830> winter<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.640> his<00:02:43.760> cost<00:02:44.060> so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
Fallen house of winter to his cost so

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.880 
Fallen house of winter to his cost so
I'm<00:02:44.720> pretty<00:02:44.900> sure<00:02:45.140> there's<00:02:45.350> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.590> kind

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
I'm pretty sure there's going to be kind

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.160 
I'm pretty sure there's going to be kind
of<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.160> time<00:02:46.610> limit<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.090> event<00:02:47.390> because<00:02:47.720> if

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
of like a time limit of event because if

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.930 
of like a time limit of event because if
it<00:02:48.410> says<00:02:48.590> he<00:02:48.740> could<00:02:48.920> rally<00:02:49.190> people<00:02:49.490> if<00:02:49.820> you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
it says he could rally people if you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.750 
it says he could rally people if you
don't<00:02:50.150> kill<00:02:50.360> something<00:02:50.840> at<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.670> within<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
don't kill something at a within a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.360 
don't kill something at a within a
certain<00:02:53.000> point<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.420> time<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.560> might<00:02:54.830> be

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
certain point of time you might be

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.280 
certain point of time you might be
killed<00:02:55.880> that's<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.540> what<00:02:56.630> I'm<00:02:56.810> taking<00:02:57.170> from

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
killed that's just what I'm taking from

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.720 
killed that's just what I'm taking from
now<00:02:57.410> or<00:02:57.590> maybe<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.950> could<00:02:58.100> be<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.340> your<00:02:58.459> ghost

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
now or maybe it could be like your ghost

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.880 
now or maybe it could be like your ghost
is<00:02:58.880> trying<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.180> open<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.600> door<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> meantime

you're able to exit there but these are

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
you're able to exit there but these are
the<00:03:02.630> three<00:03:02.810> story<00:03:03.020> missions<00:03:03.440> we<00:03:04.010> have<00:03:04.280> within
