tablespoons of baking soda which I've

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.920 
tablespoons of baking soda which I've
already<00:00:19.949> put<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.640> bowl<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:23.930> I'm

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
already put in this bowl here and I'm

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
already put in this bowl here and I'm
going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> add<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.859> water<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.609> and

going to add some water to it and
basically<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.510> want<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> form<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.199> paste<00:00:33.079> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
basically you want to form a paste you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.920 
basically you want to form a paste you

can add more baking soda if necessary to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
can add more baking soda if necessary to
the<00:00:37.079> mix<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> thicker<00:00:40.460> even<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.579> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the mix to make it thicker even if it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.229 
the mix to make it thicker even if it's
really<00:00:42.180> thin<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.760> actually<00:00:44.760> doesn't<00:00:45.120> matter

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
really thin it actually doesn't matter

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.360 
really thin it actually doesn't matter
that<00:00:45.570> much<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> change<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that much it's not going to change the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.420 
that much it's not going to change the
efficacy<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.450> mask<00:00:49.010> basically<00:00:50.010> you're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
efficacy of the mask basically you're

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
efficacy of the mask basically you're
just<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> put<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> thin<00:00:51.420> layer<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:54.170> would

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
just going to put a thin layer I would

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.869 
just going to put a thin layer I would
just<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> areas<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
just put it on the areas you're going to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.630 
just put it on the areas you're going to
extract<00:00:57.360> most<00:00:57.809> people<00:00:58.350> when<00:00:59.100> they're<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.280> home

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
extract most people when they're at home

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
extract most people when they're at home
they<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> extract<00:01:00.719> their<00:01:00.960> nose<00:01:01.199> or

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
they just want to extract their nose or

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
they just want to extract their nose or
perhaps<00:01:02.430> our<00:01:02.850> nose<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.239> their<00:01:03.420> chin<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
perhaps our nose in their chin so I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
perhaps our nose in their chin so I
would<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.610> apply<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
would just put it there just apply a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.859 
would just put it there just apply a
thin<00:01:06.510> layer<00:01:07.400> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> brush<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
thin layer if you don't have a brush you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.039 
thin layer if you don't have a brush you
could<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> cotton<00:01:10.740> ball<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.400> q-tip<00:01:12.090> really

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
could use a cotton ball a q-tip really

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.859 
could use a cotton ball a q-tip really
anything<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.680> work<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> see

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
anything would work and as you can see

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.789 
anything would work and as you can see
it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.710> pasty<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.450> mask<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.619> would

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it is very pasty the mask and I would

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
it is very pasty the mask and I would
leave<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.490> about<00:01:20.549> 15<00:01:21.210> minutes

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
leave it on for about 15 minutes

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
leave it on for about 15 minutes
I<00:01:21.869> would<00:01:22.409> rinse<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> off<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.340> warm<00:01:23.610> water<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I would rinse it off with warm water and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
I would rinse it off with warm water and
then<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.439> proceed<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.070> extraction

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
then I would proceed with extraction

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.240 
then I would proceed with extraction
make<00:01:27.330> sure<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> cover<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.650> fingertips

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
make sure that you cover your fingertips

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.469 
make sure that you cover your fingertips
with<00:01:30.090> tissue<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.950> cotton<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.729> even

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
with tissue or with cotton or even

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:33.859 
with tissue or with cotton or even
better

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
better

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.069 
better
use<00:01:34.530> two<00:01:34.890> q-tips<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.700> extract<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.600> blackheads

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
use two q-tips to extract the blackheads

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.020 
use two q-tips to extract the blackheads
so<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.009> using<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.460> fingers<00:01:38.880> at

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so that you're not using your fingers at

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
so that you're not using your fingers at
all<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:40.049> way<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.409> risking<00:01:41.009> making<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
all that way you're not risking making a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
all that way you're not risking making a
mark<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.689> fingernails

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
mark with one of your fingernails

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560 
mark with one of your fingernails
in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> surface<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> skin<00:01:45.060> from<00:01:45.360> being

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
in the surface of the skin from being

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.140 
in the surface of the skin from being
over<00:01:45.990> vigorous<00:01:46.440> in<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.860> extraction<00:01:47.310> but

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
over vigorous in your extraction but

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.450 
over vigorous in your extraction but
you'll<00:01:48.300> find<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.200> mask<00:01:49.650> really

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you'll find that this mask really

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
you'll find that this mask really
softens<00:01:51.150> your<00:01:51.360> blackhead<00:01:51.870> then<00:01:52.110> they'll<00:01:52.290> come

softens your blackhead then they'll come
right<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.940> when<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.330> done

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
right out for you and when you're done

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.530 
right out for you and when you're done
you<00:01:54.780> could<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.080> mask<00:01:55.440> or<00:01:56.220> just<00:01:57.180> put

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
you could do a mask or just put

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330 
you could do a mask or just put
moisturizer<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.190> should
