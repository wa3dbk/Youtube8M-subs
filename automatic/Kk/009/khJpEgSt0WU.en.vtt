00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
suck me out now to halftime that's the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.000 
suck me out now to halftime that's the
thing<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.989> know<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.140> kept<00:03:06.440> getting<00:03:06.530> subbed<00:03:06.860> out

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
thing you know I kept getting subbed out

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.949 
thing you know I kept getting subbed out
but<00:03:07.280> uh<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:08.120> saying<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.480> can<00:03:08.599> find<00:03:08.840> my

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
but uh they saying I can find my

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.809 
but uh they saying I can find my
teammates<00:03:09.379> good<00:03:09.590> need<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.250> cut<00:03:10.400> back<00:03:10.579> on<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
teammates good need to cut back on the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.520 
teammates good need to cut back on the
turnovers<00:03:11.390> because<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.989> turning<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.349> ball

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
turnovers because I was turning the ball

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.080 
turnovers because I was turning the ball
over<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.829> lot<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.610> know<00:03:13.670> there's<00:03:13.819> something

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
over a lot you know there's something

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.250 
over a lot you know there's something
I've<00:03:14.180> been<00:03:14.299> struggling<00:03:14.569> with<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:14.959> turning

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
I've been struggling with it's turning

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
I've been struggling with it's turning
the<00:03:15.290> ball<00:03:15.530> over<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.099> I<00:03:16.579> something<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.269> gotta

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
the ball over so I something I gotta

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.030 
the ball over so I something I gotta
figure<00:03:17.600> out<00:03:17.720> how<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.019> get<00:03:18.290> better<00:03:18.470> at<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:18.920> look

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
figure out how to get better at but look

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.199 
figure out how to get better at but look
at<00:03:19.130> me<00:03:19.250> trying<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.519> cut<00:03:19.790> out<00:03:19.819> again<00:03:20.180> right

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
at me trying to cut out again right

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.210 
at me trying to cut out again right
they're<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:21.230> they<00:03:21.380> finally<00:03:21.680> throw<00:03:21.859> it<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.100> me

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
they're all they finally throw it to me

you<00:03:34.609> know<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.819> new<00:03:34.940> physics<00:03:35.329> engine<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:36.109> works

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
you know the new physics engine it works

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.140 
you know the new physics engine it works
nice<00:03:36.769> man<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.190> works<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.459> lot<00:03:37.579> better<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:38.030> me

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
basket for the foul in one hi I didn't

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.890 
basket for the foul in one hi I didn't
get<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.790> free<00:03:43.940> throw<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.329> just<00:03:44.510> cut<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.720> out

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
get the free throw so I just cut it out

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.990 
get the free throw so I just cut it out
but<00:03:45.169> yeah<00:03:45.829> I'm<00:03:45.980> liking<00:03:46.459> these<00:03:46.519> physics<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.970> lot

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
but yeah I'm liking these physics a lot

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120 
but yeah I'm liking these physics a lot
more<00:03:47.299> than<00:03:47.450> Madden<00:03:47.750> Madden<00:03:48.260> physics<00:03:48.799> seem<00:03:48.980> to

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
more than Madden Madden physics seem to

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.039 
more than Madden Madden physics seem to
be<00:03:49.250> too<00:03:49.609> cartoony<00:03:50.239> like<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.569> would<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.840> fall

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
be too cartoony like you would just fall

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.569 
be too cartoony like you would just fall
to<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.290> ground<00:03:51.319> can<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:51.919> get<00:03:52.040> another<00:03:52.190> assist

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
to the ground can I get another assist

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.460 
to the ground can I get another assist
you<00:03:52.970> fall<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.480> ground<00:03:53.510> just<00:03:54.079> stumbling

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
you fall to the ground just stumbling

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.110 
you fall to the ground just stumbling
over<00:03:54.590> your<00:03:54.799> offensive<00:03:55.250> lineman<00:03:55.579> all<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.910> time

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
over your offensive lineman all the time

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.449 
over your offensive lineman all the time
but<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:56.989> we<00:03:57.049> go<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.349> this<00:03:57.440> Aleut<00:03:57.919> time<00:03:58.190> he'd

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
but here we go is this Aleut time he'd

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.559 
but here we go is this Aleut time he'd
go<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.579> alley

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
go to alley

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.740 
go to alley
come<00:04:00.079> on<00:04:00.230> man<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.650> gotta<00:04:00.829> catch<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.419> damn<00:04:02.419> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
come on man you gotta catch that damn I

come on man you gotta catch that damn I
was<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.109> horrible<00:04:03.319> pass<00:04:03.590> man<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.160> that's<00:04:04.220> what

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
was a horrible pass man but that's what

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.009 
was a horrible pass man but that's what
I<00:04:04.400> mean<00:04:04.549> by<00:04:04.639> them<00:04:04.700> turnovers<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:05.900> know

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
I mean by them turnovers but you know

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.960 
I mean by them turnovers but you know
you<00:04:06.620> got<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.889> go<00:04:06.950> for<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.220> risk<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.700> order<00:04:07.910> to

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
you got to go for the risk in order to

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.800 
you got to go for the risk in order to
get<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.209> reward

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
get the reward

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.379 
get the reward
get<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.200> high<00:04:09.319> step<00:04:09.590> cheese<00:04:09.859> get<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.130> file

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
get that high step cheese get the file

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.330 
get that high step cheese get the file
but<00:04:11.389> anyways<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.230> chose<00:04:12.680> my<00:04:12.829> free<00:04:13.040> throw<00:04:13.280> I

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
but anyways I chose my free throw I

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.009 
but anyways I chose my free throw I
think<00:04:13.549> it's<00:04:13.669> just<00:04:13.730> pushup<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.750> know<00:04:14.870> that's

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
think it's just pushup you know that's

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.390 
think it's just pushup you know that's
kind<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.319> how<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.470> shoot<00:04:15.709> my<00:04:15.829> free<00:04:16.039> throws<00:04:16.250> in

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
kind of how I shoot my free throws in

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.009 
kind of how I shoot my free throws in
real<00:04:16.579> life<00:04:16.729> anyways<00:04:17.180> when<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> shot<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.870> know<00:04:17.959> I

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
real life anyways when I shot you know I

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.400 
real life anyways when I shot you know I
kind<00:04:18.200> of

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
kind of

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.810 
kind of
spin<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.890> ball<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.280> bounce<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.550> a<00:04:19.640> couple

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
spin the ball and bounce it a couple

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.240 
spin the ball and bounce it a couple
times<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:20.360> I<00:04:20.630> gave<00:04:21.350> both<00:04:21.470> free<00:04:21.739> throws<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:22.100> go

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
times but I gave both free throws to go
