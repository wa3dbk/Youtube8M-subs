second<00:04:38.409> because<00:04:38.469> I<00:04:38.620> wanna<00:04:38.800> show<00:04:39.159> you<00:04:39.449> what<00:04:40.979> the

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
second because I wanna show you what the

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.740 
second because I wanna show you what the
Candice<00:04:42.460> stuff<00:04:42.669> looks<00:04:42.939> like<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.360> one<00:04:43.569> it

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
Candice stuff looks like this one it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.749 
Candice stuff looks like this one it
comes<00:04:44.020> in<00:04:44.349> syrup<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.610> that's<00:04:46.509> how<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:46.930> comes

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
comes in syrup and that's how it comes

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.270 
comes in syrup and that's how it comes
and<00:04:48.759> it's<00:04:49.419> really<00:04:49.750> really<00:04:49.840> um<00:04:50.349> nice

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
and it's really really um nice

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.309 
and it's really really um nice
I<00:04:51.310> mean<00:04:51.610> really<00:04:51.909> there<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.330> not<00:04:52.930> much

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
I mean really there is not much

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.129 
I mean really there is not much
difference<00:04:53.860> between<00:04:54.129> the<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:55.330> fact<00:04:55.719> I<00:04:56.020> think

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
difference between the in fact I think

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.450 
difference between the in fact I think
that<00:04:56.439> the<00:04:56.590> canned<00:04:56.860> one<00:04:57.129> each<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.759> much<00:04:58.000> softer

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
that the canned one each is much softer

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.219 
that the canned one each is much softer
and<00:05:00.460> again<00:05:00.729> it's<00:05:00.939> really<00:05:01.210> really<00:05:01.569> delicious

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
and again it's really really delicious

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.499 
and again it's really really delicious
um<00:05:02.889> couple<00:05:03.159> things<00:05:03.430> on<00:05:03.580> how<00:05:03.729> you<00:05:03.789> can<00:05:04.090> pick<00:05:04.330> the
