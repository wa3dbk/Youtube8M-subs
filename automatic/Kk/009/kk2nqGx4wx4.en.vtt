00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.380
 So then seventh February of the year 7 4 Christin 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.500
 Percent there 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.960
 Folk on Jupiter 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.239
 Saturn was already there in the zodiac sign of Pisces 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.859
 and that was the sign of the astrologer Babylon, of which many Jews 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:13.530
 were 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.410
 Percent then had the story with the Buga should be the people of Israel 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.890
 land 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.000
 brought to the Bobby Long has a river 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 van Dannen had brought Zweiromland land and so there was a lot of Jewish 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.380
 Students these astrologers schools 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.490
 from April 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.930
 in the twelfth of April was this particular this new star in this 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.480
 two bright planets is in the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.500
 Percent which would have largest planets in the solar system Saturn and Jupiter 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.600
 from the twelfth on the morning the dawn was off for dawn 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.190
 two hours to see 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.990
 the first conjunction where both were really directly together 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.180
 that was 29 Steinmeier da Monza already quite neat to see and you knew 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.300
 that the next conjunction 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.880
 It was new on the third of October. It is also a bad one 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.960
 Data long distance to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.850
 BGN since Westland 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.880
 is summer so much too hot 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.810
 but on the third of October that, of course, especially when the third of October 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.870
 that Jung just states that back to the Indian reconciliation festival so view 3 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820
 these astrologers made the journey 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.350
 to Jerusalem because they finally believed that in the country 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 a new king in the west 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.090
 Now it is clear you need so when in Dahme third October opens 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.030
 and so would want to come to Jerusalem from the many time around today 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.050
 to do on the pier 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.240
 or by car 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.140
 In those days you had camels in no time how long you needed 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.360
 by Bobby Long until then 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.540
 two months 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.990
 almost two months 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.630
 So they arrived 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.510
 end of November 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.470
 of the year 7 BC 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.680
 and that you already have that whole planetary constellation, by the way 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 as I said Keppler and the whole 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.829
 Percent of ancient astrologers, of all things, as he accurately calculates 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:55.900
 you found 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.300
 on which day 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.340
 was standing 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.160
 this conjunction so 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.110
 to move from Jerusalem towards Bethlehem 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.739
 This conjunction appeared properly for the third time 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.059
 on the fourth of December of the year 7 BC 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.119
 and if you look at it in the planetarium 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.449
 and after 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.359
 how that must have looked 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.609
 when these three astrologers stood in Jerusalem looking for their star 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:27.309
 to have 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.729
 then you can see that was exactly the fourth of december 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.449
 Evening around half past eight 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.849
 there the star stood exactly 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.700
 about Peter Herrmann there is a road of so 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.729
 to Bethlehem guided exactly from north to south 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.120
 and so you can say so 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.089
 that the star of Bethlehem 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.779
 astronomical was definitely reality 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.959
 because this conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter was extremely good at observing 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.109
 Mediterranean Sea 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.889
 so that was visible to many people percent in the sky just for astrologers 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.579
 just something very special 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.289
 that is, Jupiter a king 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.789
 with a shelter with a shelter in the bolt of Saturn in a zodiac sign 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.789
 What is the symbol of ISRA? 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.609
 to go through this whole story we know 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.129
 Kepler knew a lot more about it than anyone else would have before 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.649
 then the cuneiform UNP percent was translated by the good Mr. Schnabel 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.870
 from astronomy to next time not much understood I was very 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.979
 surprised when you said him Listen, the Kepler has already planned 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.769
 Firth Bale tells 50 years and nowadays it's just one 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.249
 wonderful story 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.409
 which tells us something about what many many people percent on the subject 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.569
 said what they did try to find out 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.169
 and while I hope 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.879
 Kunze Dance that one settles scientific discoveries too 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.839
 Bible still finds it in a old book again calms her a bit 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.939
 and that they are not afraid to enter the next millennium
