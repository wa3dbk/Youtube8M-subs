00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.309
 hello all welcome to the channel 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.880
 barbie and cÃ­a good because today we bring a 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.360
 demo the hatsune miku project demo 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.280
 look and demo x him with it down to 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.910
 the nintendo 3ds in his game cited musical 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.920
 with hatsune miku as the protagonist and 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.899
 it's good to see it had looked pretty 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.290
 curious you are not in these entertaining 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.510
 to go marking the rhythm of the music 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.570
 then in two ways or by hitting the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.769
 screen or via buttons 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.499
 and well the demo brings us to choose 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.409
 three little dresses we have the body 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.550
 complete or we have only or be a 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.829
 Natural Personal full body 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.809
 complete or only the body by 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.679
 example if we take this from here 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:04.670
 only the dress will change us 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:08.510
 hairstyle will remain the same and if we go to the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.000
 full part because we have the hat and 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.000
 all included in case we want to leave you 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.270
 I run in a way from the head of a 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.600
 shape and the body of another but let's 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 Take the original time and it is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.119
 we see how it consists in marking the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 rhythm obviously I'm not 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.209
 commenting at the same time that I'm recording 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.409
 the engraving the video because you have to 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.140
 concentrate there at the time of hitting 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.869
 In fact, I made the tap mode 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 which is to hit the other is that of the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.280
 buttons and I've done it on difficulty 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.729
 difficult first of all 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.590
 tell you how good is a musical game 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.349
 the protagonist here is the music there 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.840
 have to keep up with the rhythm in this case 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.420
 caught the tap option that is to go 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.069
 checking in the colors of the screen 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.069
 as it is coming out the colors that we 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.050
 indicate the other on the button as it is to go 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:09.729
 pressing the buttons as indicated 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.230
 x and it's the same but with buttons and as 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.150
 it's a musical game and the protagonist is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.710
 the music then happens what happens not 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.830
 I can be silent so that it 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.990
 listen to the music but you know the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.330
 problems that usually give this so 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.940
 So what I 'm going to do is give my 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.080
 small opinion not in my little and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.030
 humble opinion on what appeared to me 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.620
 this week to see in this kind of 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.620
 youngsters he has his point is 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.390
 fun hooks you is simple 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.480
 because the operating system 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.640
 simple but who likes hatsune 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.830
 miku and he likes in his songs because I 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.020
 I think he's really going to enjoy it and 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.450
 he will enjoy it enough because they are his 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.400
 songs and you can customize it in the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.970
 game when it comes complete it will come out 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.150
 September 11, then you can 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.520
 customize there of the little dress and others 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.940
 things that good for fans of 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.850
 demi that is great apart from being able 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.620
 listen to his songs days following the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.409
 sales rhythm is marking 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.690
 there in this case the different colors 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.879
 Hard mode which is what I have 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.209
 taken as you see has three colors 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.790
 the yellow the pink and the blue and we have 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.610
 to go giving them soft taps is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.670
 soft to the touch screen there is no need 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.829
 give comfort a soft hammer 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.140
 taps and when we get these three 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.030
 circles with some arrows what you have to 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.799
 do is use anywhere in the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.390
 battle the screen and see if the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:46.000
 battle the screen and slide the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.640
 slightly the pencil towards the direction 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.230
 that indicates us and is already has no more 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.660
 complications and when we giving 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.310
 is musical of that style that carries with 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.890
 a rainbow bar there next to what 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.409
 you have to do is cross keep pressing 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.870
 until the rainbow ends 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.900
 operation is very simple other 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.970
 time with the sliding buttons that 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.340
 makes and slides 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.290
 in operation simple but good 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.230
 hey has his complication helping him 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.200
 one color or another down on the screen 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.320
 tactile we see a green bar that puts the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.930
 live our life is good to say it 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.060
 in some way as we are doing 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.730
 here linking combos as it goes 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.710
 filling the green bar and then there is a 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.200
 very small very small flechita 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.020
 tiny on top of the green bar that 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.420
 is sliding and is the duration of the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.000
 song what what's left is not what 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.530
 we have on the left is what has 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.570
 past and song and what remains to 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.200
 the right is the piece that we still have left 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.270
 to travel personally because I'm not 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.510
 very given to this type of games but of 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.720
 Once in a while, yes, you want some game 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.550
 of this style that I call it 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.080
 total disconnection is to say something 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.090
 completely different than normally 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.220
 you do not play, but what does it do to you? 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.960
 distract you and how good is your grace and 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.720
 in this case, I already tell you that if you 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.600
 musics like Hatsune Miku for 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 more still no point in favor of the games and 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.410
 I 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.830
 I remember the different things that I have 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:23.140

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.620
 this here that is giving the 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.020
 Different colors according to indicate us in 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.550
 the touch screen and the mode of the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.919
 buttons that is to give the x and abe according to 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.500

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.660
 mystery and then we have 2 little songs 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.900
 different this and another one to be able 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.110
 try on the demo and there's the end of the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.790
 full song give the score 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.220
 man, it has not been bad for me 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.050
 score even though it has cost me 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.370
 At first, pick up the rhythm 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.400
 I was wrong a little bit 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.710

 because I thought it was curious and 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.760
 in case someone is a fan of hatsune miku 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.979
