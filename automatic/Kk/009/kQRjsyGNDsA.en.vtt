players steel guitar players play those
kind<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.090> could<00:00:42.239> even<00:00:42.360> make<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> whole

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
kind of so we could even make a whole

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
kind of so we could even make a whole
introduction<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.100> particular

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
introduction out of that particular

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
introduction out of that particular
double<00:00:45.660> stop<00:00:45.899> phrase<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:46.829> working

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
double stop phrase and that's working

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.810 
double stop phrase and that's working
out<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:50.420> then<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> D<00:00:54.590> stay<00:00:55.590> there<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
out of a then you get to D stay there if

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
out of a then you get to D stay there if
you<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.629> more<00:00:59.690> that's<00:01:00.690> part<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.500> we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you go up to more that's part of if we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
you go up to more that's part of if we
were<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> key<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> e<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:06.770> up

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
were in the key of e we would go up

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
were in the key of e we would go up
there<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.659> we're<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.869> use

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
there but we're not so we're gonna use

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.330 
there but we're not so we're gonna use
part<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.850> go<00:01:12.600> backwards<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.310> e

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
part of that and go backwards from the e

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
part of that and go backwards from the e
e<00:01:16.939> seven<00:01:18.799> seven<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.100> chord<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> d<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.780> we

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
e seven seven and any chord is a d so we

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.340 
e seven seven and any chord is a d so we
can<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.229> back<00:01:26.299> then<00:01:27.299> once<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.810> play<00:01:28.049> that's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
can go back then once we play that's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.560 
can go back then once we play that's
over<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:28.770> e<00:01:28.860> seven<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> chord

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:54.249 

so<00:01:35.230> we<00:01:35.380> start<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.680> be<00:01:41.890> then<00:01:42.250> up<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.610> e

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.240 

and<00:01:55.259> last<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.460> D<00:01:56.790> chord<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.770> B<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and last one was a D chord on the B and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.690 
and last one was a D chord on the B and
the<00:01:59.369> G<00:01:59.579> together<00:02:00.350> hey<00:02:01.729> G<00:02:03.289> hey<00:02:04.909> it's<00:02:05.909> actually<00:02:06.299> D

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
the G together hey G hey it's actually D

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.860 
the G together hey G hey it's actually D
and<00:02:08.700> E<00:02:09.209> six<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.679> want<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.209> b-minor<00:02:12.590> than<00:02:13.590> a

and E six if you want a b-minor than a
if<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.080> working<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.530> scales<00:02:16.920> you'd<00:02:17.190> be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
if you're working in scales you'd be

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.839 
if you're working in scales you'd be
doing<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.700> accountant<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.330> way<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> out<00:02:23.819> of

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
doing it accountant that way so out of

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.460 
doing it accountant that way so out of
that<00:02:24.000> chord<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.660> use<00:02:24.930> any<00:02:25.140> combination

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that chord you can use any combination

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.150 
that chord you can use any combination
of<00:02:26.040> two<00:02:26.220> notes<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:27.239> make<00:02:27.530> your<00:02:28.530> double<00:02:28.890> stop

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
of two notes to make your double stop

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.090 
of two notes to make your double stop

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
you're playing a whole long bunch of

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.930 
you're playing a whole long bunch of
those<00:02:33.780> things<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.980> tie<00:02:35.250> them<00:02:35.519> into<00:02:35.700> each

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
those things you can tie them into each

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.330 
those things you can tie them into each
other<00:02:36.239> by<00:02:36.930> doing<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.709> were<00:02:37.830> doing<00:02:38.040> from

other by doing like we were doing from

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.630 
other by doing like we were doing from
the<00:02:38.459> e<00:02:41.660> that's<00:02:42.660> free<00:02:46.069> then<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.400> want<00:02:47.580> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the e that's free then if you want to

the e that's free then if you want to
get<00:02:47.760> back<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.569> back<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.230> could

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
get back just right back to a you could

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.809 
get back just right back to a you could
go<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.180> four<00:02:54.750> three<00:02:55.590> two<00:02:56.220> one

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
go and what that is four three two one

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.460 
go and what that is four three two one
in<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.540> key<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:58.160> four<00:02:59.160> D<00:02:59.970> chord<00:03:00.299> if<00:03:01.079> we're<00:03:01.380> an

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
in the key of a four D chord if we're an

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.840 
in the key of a four D chord if we're an
ABCD<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.150> four<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.850> three

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
ABCD it's a four so you go for three

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.800 
ABCD it's a four so you go for three
minor<00:03:06.090> 2<00:03:06.750> minor<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:09.150> sounds<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.569> little<00:03:09.690> too

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
minor 2 minor that sounds a little too

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.050 
minor 2 minor that sounds a little too
Gomer<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.410> do<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.579> in<00:03:11.790> just

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
Gomer to do that so if you do it in just

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.670 
Gomer to do that so if you do it in just
the<00:03:12.540> double<00:03:13.260> stops<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:15.319> little<00:03:16.319> more<00:03:16.440> country

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
the double stops a little more country

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.900 
the double stops a little more country
sound<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.640> go

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:40.650 

and<00:03:23.090> hammer<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.690> D<00:03:23.930> chord<00:03:24.260> e<00:03:29.290> rear-ending

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.990 

that's<00:03:41.660> pretty<00:03:41.930> country<00:03:42.200> right<00:03:42.530> there<00:03:43.000> seeds

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
that's pretty country right there seeds

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.420 
that's pretty country right there seeds
and<00:03:44.270> all
