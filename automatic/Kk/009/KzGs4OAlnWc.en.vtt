white<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> head<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
white in the head I kind of want to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.270 
white in the head I kind of want to
class<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> head<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
class up the head a little bit and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.889 
class up the head a little bit and
really<00:01:59.520> give<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> strong<00:02:00.180> presence<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.719> but

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
really give a strong presence to it but

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
really give a strong presence to it but
I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> colorways<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.890> used<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.340> are

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I think the colorways I used here are

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.800 
I think the colorways I used here are
gonna<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.180> shaft<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> look

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
gonna go with that shaft and look

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.770 
gonna go with that shaft and look
absolutely<00:02:04.380> insane<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.119> yeah<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.750> through

more<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.800> shape<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.670> Thrones<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.060> like

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
more the shape of it and Thrones I like

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.120 
more the shape of it and Thrones I like
to<00:02:26.300> do<00:02:26.420> mids<00:02:26.720> unless<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.260> really<00:02:27.560> specified

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
to do mids unless it's really specified

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.860 
to do mids unless it's really specified
something<00:02:28.489> else<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:29.000> shift<00:02:29.600> at<00:02:29.750> other

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
something else I can shift at other

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.250 
something else I can shift at other
spots<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.830> mid<00:02:31.610> works<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.060> best<00:02:32.270> for<00:02:32.569> this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
spots but a mid works the best for this

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.050 
spots but a mid works the best for this
type<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.440> POC<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.830> I'll<00:02:33.920> explain<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.430> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
type of POC and I'll explain that and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.520 
type of POC and I'll explain that and
it's<00:02:35.239> not<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.750> as<00:02:35.840> defined<00:02:36.170> as<00:02:36.319> mesh

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
it's not going to be as defined as mesh

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.680 
it's not going to be as defined as mesh
would<00:02:36.680> be<00:02:36.860> because<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.880> leather<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.420> much

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
would be because it is leather it's much

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.059 
would be because it is leather it's much
more<00:02:38.870> contingent<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.440> little<00:02:39.620> bit<00:02:39.709> more<00:02:39.860> liquid

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
more contingent a little bit more liquid

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.550 
more contingent a little bit more liquid
so<00:02:40.880> you're<00:02:41.540> able<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.930> different<00:02:42.200> hold<00:02:42.470> in

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
so you're able to get different hold in

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080 
so you're able to get different hold in
different<00:02:42.769> places<00:02:42.950> without<00:02:43.220> over<00:02:43.670> defining

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
different places without over defining

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
different places without over defining
the<00:02:44.540> pocket<00:02:45.200> that's<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.830> greatest

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
the pocket that's kind of the greatest

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.720 
the pocket that's kind of the greatest
attribute<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.500> thrown<00:02:48.739> pocket<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.400> that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
attribute of the thrown pocket it's that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.280 
attribute of the thrown pocket it's that
ability<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.299> I'll<00:02:50.540> explain<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.959> second

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
ability that I'll explain in a second

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.840 
ability that I'll explain in a second
the<00:02:51.380> other<00:02:51.410> really<00:02:51.650> cool<00:02:51.769> thing<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.370> lot<00:02:52.730> of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
the other really cool thing is a lot of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.930 
the other really cool thing is a lot of
times<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.150> guys<00:02:53.239> won't<00:02:53.450> see<00:02:53.630> channels<00:02:54.080> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
times you guys won't see channels and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.610 
times you guys won't see channels and
traditional<00:02:55.940> pockets<00:02:56.269> but<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> lot<00:02:57.590> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
traditional pockets but I have a lot of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.740 
traditional pockets but I have a lot of
practice<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.100> able<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.180> get<00:02:59.269> some<00:02:59.510> channel

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
practice and able to to get some channel

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.690 
practice and able to to get some channel
especially<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.530> throne<00:03:00.799> we<00:03:01.400> can<00:03:01.549> drop

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
said he could he's pretty sure he could

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.550

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
break a hundred shooting with it because

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.930 
break a hundred shooting with it because
it<00:03:21.680> has<00:03:21.709> such<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> nice<00:03:22.220> snap<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
we're gonna try that but the biggest

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.840 
we're gonna try that but the biggest

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
thing with the the throne that I love

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.250 
thing with the the throne that I love
the<00:03:28.940> most<00:03:28.970> are<00:03:29.359> kind<00:03:29.600> of<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:29.750> contingent

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
the most are kind of this contingent

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.599 
the most are kind of this contingent
stringing<00:03:30.590> there's<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.980> black<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.549> the

much with all heads but this one it's

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.979 
much with all heads but this one it's
designed<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.150> do<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.359> or<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.600> pocket<00:03:53.840> is

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
designed to do that or this pocket is

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:54.729 
designed to do that or this pocket is
