00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
from them late the season and I think if

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.490 
from them late the season and I think if
you<00:05:10.770> CJ<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.610> take<00:05:11.850> away<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.090> sivir<00:05:12.480> now<00:05:12.750> you

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
you CJ you take away the sivir now you

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.290 
you CJ you take away the sivir now you

play<00:05:15.450> this<00:05:15.570> team<00:05:15.810> fighting<00:05:16.020> style<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.560> we're

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
play this team fighting style that we're

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.020 
play this team fighting style that we're
so<00:05:16.830> good<00:05:17.070> at<00:05:17.100> yeah<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.700> think<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:17.880> certainly

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
so good at yeah I think it certainly
