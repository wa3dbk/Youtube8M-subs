00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
little expensive for a pot but I get

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.990 
little expensive for a pot but I get
requests<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.050> got<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> money<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.620> like

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
do today is a boil test using the Fancy

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.229 
do today is a boil test using the Fancy
Feast<00:00:42.899> stove<00:00:43.260> while<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.280> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
Feast stove while I have them out just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.660 
Feast stove while I have them out just
like<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.550> now<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:49.289> might<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.309> good

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like so now this might not be a good

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.660 
like so now this might not be a good
arrangement<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.640> diameter<00:00:53.640> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
arrangement for this the diameter of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209 
arrangement for this the diameter of
this<00:00:53.910> pot<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> only<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.840> four<00:00:55.140> inches<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
this pot is only like four inches the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
this pot is only like four inches the
diameter<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.239> flame<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.379> inside

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
diameter of this flame the inside

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
diameter of this flame the inside
diameter<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> flame<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.850> about<00:01:00.239> two

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
diameter of the flame is about two

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.139 
diameter of the flame is about two
inches<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.219> when<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> put<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.730> there

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
inches so when you put that on there

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
inches so when you put that on there
you're<00:01:03.750> only<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> ring<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you're only going to have a ring of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
you're only going to have a ring of
about<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.570> an<00:01:06.570> inch<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.439> around

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
about of an inch all the way around

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.260 
about of an inch all the way around
where<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> flames<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.939> hitting

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
where the flames are going to be hitting

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
where the flames are going to be hitting
it<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.049> hoping<00:01:10.350> it'll<00:01:10.560> hit<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.010> come

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it but I'm hoping it'll hit it and come

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.390 
it but I'm hoping it'll hit it and come
up<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> side<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.970> still<00:01:12.780> heat<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.400> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
up the side and still heat it up but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.390 
up the side and still heat it up but
we'll<00:01:14.580> find<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.509> might<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> pot

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
we'll find out it this might be a pot

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
we'll find out it this might be a pot
that<00:01:17.400> needs<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> flames<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.509> coming<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that needs the flames that coming up in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.789 
that needs the flames that coming up in
the<00:01:19.290> middle<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.290> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the middle and then going out but like I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.260 
the middle and then going out but like I
said<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.070> wanted<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> try<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.880> while<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
said I just wanted to try this while I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
said I just wanted to try this while I
had<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> let<00:01:26.130> me<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.610> water

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
had it out so let me get some water

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.330 
had it out so let me get some water
prepped<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.320> methanol<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
prepped get some methanol in here

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569 
prepped get some methanol in here
and<00:01:29.820> I'll<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.119> back<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.630> test<00:01:31.009> ok<00:01:32.009> I've<00:01:32.340> got

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and I'll be back for a test ok I've got

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.730 
and I'll be back for a test ok I've got
2<00:01:32.880> cups<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> water<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.810> setting<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.350> 60

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
just got done snowing outside but we're

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.899 
just got done snowing outside but we're
expecting<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:44.850> freezing<00:01:45.420> rain<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.310> got

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
expecting some freezing rain so I got

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.469 
expecting some freezing rain so I got
this<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.990> well<00:01:49.170> centered<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.479> Fancy

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this pretty well centered on the Fancy

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.340 
this pretty well centered on the Fancy
Feast<00:01:51.720> stove<00:01:52.079> let's<00:01:52.950> light<00:01:53.310> her<00:01:53.460> up

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.200 

start<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.950> think<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.490> can<00:02:00.640> see<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.969> flame

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
start that I think you can see the flame

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.620 
start that I think you can see the flame
is<00:02:01.390> going<00:02:01.719> around<00:02:06.210> there<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:07.450> see<00:02:07.600> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
is going around there you can see a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.250 
is going around there you can see a
little<00:02:07.840> better<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.349> way<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:10.269> let's<00:02:10.989> see<00:02:11.170> how

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
little better that way so let's see how

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.290 
little better that way so let's see how
long<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.590> takes<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.310> get<00:02:12.550> two<00:02:12.940> cups<00:02:13.180> of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
long it takes this to get two cups of

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.710 
long it takes this to get two cups of
water<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> boil<00:02:15.390> okay<00:02:16.390> we're<00:02:16.540> now<00:02:16.660> two

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
water to a boil okay we're now two

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.780 
water to a boil okay we're now two
minutes<00:02:17.200> into<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> test<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.129> temperature<00:02:18.640> is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
minutes into the test the temperature is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.369 
minutes into the test the temperature is
up<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.120> one<00:02:19.239> hundred<00:02:19.450> thirteen<00:02:19.930> hundred<00:02:20.319> and

up to one hundred thirteen hundred and
fourteen<00:02:20.830> degrees<00:02:21.010> Fahrenheit<00:02:21.700> that's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
fourteen degrees Fahrenheit that's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.869 
fourteen degrees Fahrenheit that's
really<00:02:23.019> much<00:02:23.280> faster<00:02:24.280> than<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.580> thought<00:02:24.760> it

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
really much faster than I thought it

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.360 
really much faster than I thought it
would<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.360> think<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.650> see<00:02:26.860> it's<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.099> nice

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
would be I think you can see it's a nice

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.490 
would be I think you can see it's a nice
pattern<00:02:27.790> they're<00:02:28.209> going<00:02:28.540> up<00:02:28.720> curving<00:02:29.349> out

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
pattern they're going up curving out

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.250 
pattern they're going up curving out
over<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.099> side<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.579> pot<00:02:30.930> looks<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
over the side of the pot looks like the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.640 
over the side of the pot looks like the
flames<00:02:32.560> are<00:02:32.769> coming<00:02:33.900> coming<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.110> about<00:02:35.380> this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
flames are coming coming up about this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.240 
flames are coming coming up about this
high<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.549> edge<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.940> pot<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.709> pretty

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
high on the edge of the pot so pretty

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.300 
high on the edge of the pot so pretty
nice<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.930> let's<00:02:41.470> see<00:02:41.620> how<00:02:41.739> long<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.099> takes

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
nice but let's see how long it takes

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.789 
nice but let's see how long it takes
this<00:02:42.549> to<00:02:42.760> get<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.420> full<00:02:43.780> boil<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.590> two

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
this to get to a full boil I have two

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.250 
this to get to a full boil I have two
other<00:02:44.980> pots<00:02:45.849> that<00:02:46.150> compare<00:02:46.510> with<00:02:46.540> time<00:02:47.019> on

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
other pots that compare with time on

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.949 
other pots that compare with time on
this<00:02:47.500> burner<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.430> stove<00:02:48.760> rather<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.810> we'll

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
this burner this stove rather so we'll

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.860 
this burner this stove rather so we'll
see<00:02:50.110> how<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.290> does<00:02:53.250> there<00:02:54.250> we<00:02:54.370> have<00:02:54.489> two<00:02:54.670> ten<00:02:55.000> -

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
see how it does there we have two ten -

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.650 
see how it does there we have two ten -
eleven<00:02:58.500> -<00:02:59.500> twelve<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.310> six<00:03:00.670> minutes<00:03:00.970> forty

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
eleven - twelve and six minutes forty

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:11.910 
eleven - twelve and six minutes forty
seconds<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:06.370> bad<00:03:08.100> okay<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:11.620> was<00:03:11.769> two

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
seconds not bad okay so that was two

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680 
seconds not bad okay so that was two
cups<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.250> water<00:03:12.340> starting<00:03:12.910> at<00:03:13.030> 60<00:03:13.389> degrees

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
cups of water starting at 60 degrees

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.949 
cups of water starting at 60 degrees
came<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> boil<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.799> six<00:03:15.700> minutes<00:03:16.060> 40<00:03:16.389> seconds

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
came to a boil in six minutes 40 seconds

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.440 
came to a boil in six minutes 40 seconds
now<00:03:17.799> with<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.130> other<00:03:18.310> two<00:03:18.549> tests<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.239> did

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
now with the other two tests that I did

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.410 
now with the other two tests that I did
on<00:03:19.599> this<00:03:19.810> stove<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.190> Boy<00:03:21.459> Scout<00:03:21.819> pot<00:03:22.120> took

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
on this stove the Boy Scout pot took

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
on this stove the Boy Scout pot took
five<00:03:22.870> minutes<00:03:23.109> 44<00:03:23.920> seconds<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.989> zebra

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
five minutes 44 seconds and the zebra

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.490 
five minutes 44 seconds and the zebra
pot<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.130> 12<00:03:27.430> centimeter<00:03:28.000> which<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:28.959> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
pot the 12 centimeter which is the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500 
pot the 12 centimeter which is the
diameter<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.340> 2<00:03:30.639> centimeters<00:03:31.269> bigger

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
diameter that is 2 centimeters bigger

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.180 
diameter that is 2 centimeters bigger
than<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.380> gave<00:03:32.590> for<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.859> little<00:03:33.069> bit

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
than this so it gave for a little bit

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.270 
than this so it gave for a little bit
wider<00:03:33.430> abased<00:03:34.079> was<00:03:35.079> six<00:03:35.380> minutes<00:03:35.769> seven

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
wider abased was six minutes seven

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.420 
wider abased was six minutes seven
seconds<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.810> sick<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.829> have<00:03:38.980> six<00:03:39.250> minutes

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
seconds so sick you have six minutes

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.159 
seconds so sick you have six minutes
seven<00:03:39.730> seconds<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.419> this<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.720> six<00:03:40.959> minutes

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
seven seconds so this is six minutes

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.390 
seven seconds so this is six minutes
forty<00:03:42.269> not<00:03:43.269> really<00:03:43.720> bad<00:03:43.930> now<00:03:44.889> I'm<00:03:45.010> not<00:03:45.220> going

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
forty not really bad now I'm not going

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.400 
forty not really bad now I'm not going
to<00:03:45.489> do<00:03:45.669> a<00:03:45.970> run<00:03:46.299> out<00:03:46.480> tests<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:46.989> this<00:03:47.139> I'm<00:03:47.380> not

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
to do a run out tests on this I'm not

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.890 
to do a run out tests on this I'm not
really<00:03:47.769> too<00:03:48.069> worried<00:03:48.970> about<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.419> was<00:03:49.660> just

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
really too worried about that I was just

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.920 
really too worried about that I was just
checking<00:03:50.200> for<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.590> boiling<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:52.180> other<00:03:52.359> day<00:03:52.599> I

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
checking for the boiling the other day I

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.640 
checking for the boiling the other day I
had<00:03:53.380> said<00:03:53.709> about<00:03:53.739> how<00:03:55.349> people<00:03:56.349> had<00:03:56.470> said

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
had said about how people had said

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.440 
had said about how people had said
there's<00:03:56.829> no<00:03:57.010> handles<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:57.669> this<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.180> showed

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
there's no handles on this and I showed

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.990 
there's no handles on this and I showed
how<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:58.690> can<00:03:58.930> use<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.109> pot<00:03:59.440> holder<00:03:59.739> to<00:04:00.700> do<00:04:00.880> it

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
how you can use a pot holder to do it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.589 
how you can use a pot holder to do it
what<00:04:01.269> do<00:04:01.329> they<00:04:01.419> do<00:04:01.480> with<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.720> there<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.139> is

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
what do they do with that there it is

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.660 
what do they do with that there it is
there's<00:04:02.840> one<00:04:03.189> you<00:04:04.189> know<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.400> could<00:04:04.549> use

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
there's one you know you could use

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.300 
there's one you know you could use
something<00:04:04.939> like<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.709> use<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.920> other<00:04:07.069> one

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
something like this I use the other one

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.860 
something like this I use the other one
it<00:04:07.430> has<00:04:07.549> holes<00:04:07.849> in<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.359> it's<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.569> little<00:04:08.659> bit

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
it has holes in it so it's a little bit

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.979 
it has holes in it so it's a little bit
lighter<00:04:09.370> but<00:04:10.370> what<00:04:10.999> I<00:04:11.030> usually<00:04:11.120> do<00:04:11.689> is<00:04:11.870> I

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
lighter but what I usually do is I

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.559 
lighter but what I usually do is I
always<00:04:12.349> have<00:04:12.590> gloves<00:04:13.069> with<00:04:13.370> me<00:04:13.549> and<00:04:14.389> I'll<00:04:14.540> use

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
always have gloves with me and I'll use

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.849 
always have gloves with me and I'll use
something<00:04:15.019> like<00:04:15.109> this<00:04:15.409> to<00:04:15.620> take<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:15.980> off<00:04:16.130> so

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
something like this to take it off so

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.560 
something like this to take it off so
that's<00:04:18.859> not<00:04:19.099> I<00:04:19.370> mean<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:19.849> not<00:04:20.000> giving<00:04:20.329> me<00:04:20.449> any

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
that's not I mean it's not giving me any

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.529 
that's not I mean it's not giving me any
problems<00:04:20.840> with<00:04:21.320> except<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.859> student<00:04:22.310> is

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
problems with except the student is

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.089 
problems with except the student is
let's<00:04:23.539> see<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:23.990> side<00:04:26.650> see<00:04:27.650> even<00:04:27.979> with

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
let's see on the side see even with

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.339 
let's see on the side see even with
leather<00:04:28.340> gloves<00:04:28.729> like<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.419> can<00:04:30.139> handle

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
leather gloves like this I can handle
