l<00:00:40.290> 96<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.190> prefer<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> variable<00:00:42.690> zoom<00:00:42.899> more

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
l 96 I prefer the variable zoom more

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
l 96 I prefer the variable zoom more
than<00:00:43.890> anything<00:00:44.129> else<00:00:44.460> simply<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:45.180> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
than anything else simply because I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
than anything else simply because I
don't<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.160> feel<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.670> comfortable

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
don't know I just feel more comfortable

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.350 
don't know I just feel more comfortable
with<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.840> use<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.100> second<00:00:50.579> variable<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
with it I use the second variable of it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.959 
with it I use the second variable of it
so<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> second<00:00:52.289> zoom<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.520> basically

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so the second zoom in so basically

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
so the second zoom in so basically
whenever<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.690> spawn<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.680> zoom<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
whenever I spawn in a zoom in and I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.990 
whenever I spawn in a zoom in and I
press<00:00:57.000> B<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.859> that<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.129> seems<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.550> work<00:00:59.850> out

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
think it's absolutely ridiculous that

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.740 
think it's absolutely ridiculous that
people<00:06:21.230> would<00:06:21.590> complain<00:06:21.770> about<00:06:22.010> such<00:06:22.580> a<00:06:22.610> thing

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
people would complain about such a thing

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.630 
people would complain about such a thing
and<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.410> I<00:06:24.440> hope<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:24.770> guys<00:06:24.980> understand<00:06:25.520> my
