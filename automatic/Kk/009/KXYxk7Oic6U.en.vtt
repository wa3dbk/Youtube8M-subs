00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.920
 hello everyone be the engine 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.380
 from holidays and then resume 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.990
 now with videos we start with 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.540
 one quite simple fast and right 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.850
 in short, to warm up and that's the one up 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.820
 how to change the bulbs here in the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.500
 in the ceiling light practically then it is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.370
 quite simple so i'm not 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.930
 I will be there as my usual to lose myself in 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.750
 explanations or who knows what 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.820
 to take it off we have to play with two 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.379
 points this is this back here 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.750
 practically there are two hooks that it 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 they hold firm so we equip ourselves with a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.720
 hunt life simply battle and it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 gently insert here in the middle 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.260
 without damaging the plastic 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.000
 in the roof and nothing we pull down 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 so maybe we can help each other with the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.830
 fingers or another screwdriver you see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830
 you 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.640
 here it is the first hook it is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.250
 we are practically detached 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.010
 according to that below more or less 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.000
 we do the same job we help each other 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.280
 with the other hand and that's it 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.789
 once unhooked the two hooks 1 say 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 thence down there is the plug here from 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.149
 unplug it now we explain it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.049
 and there is also this nice Scotch that 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.259
 he smeared all the hands with glue 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.240
 then you let the plug stay wet 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:43.530
 here we press a pin there is a 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.509
 let's say let's say and let's do it done and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.640
 if it all comes practically 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.929
 we pull off sewer water morning round 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.359
 it was to change light bulb we must 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.280
 remove this license cover 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.780
 always open this way 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.700
 our screwdriver 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.179
 let's go to leverage at this point for 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.179
 examples 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:10.560
 here is done and voila we raise here 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:13.770
 are our two light bulbs are twelve 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.110
 sometimes 10 watts are 10 watts each 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.110
 nothing to change them just pull away 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.410
 here it is 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.880
 you pull away if you take it once 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.730
 of course to get it back 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.690
 in its seat 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.190
 that's it done until nothing gets stuck 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.660
 but at that point we can close again 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.380
 we simply go and put it back 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.560
 spinotto thinking of art lac we attack 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.860
 Scotch again even though I know how much 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.050
 can serve that crap and let's go to 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.050
 put it this way 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.070
 we push and voila changed me 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.230
 bulbs to our perfumer this 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.740
 is how much boys then I take off 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.700
 now I wanted the glue of my hands 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.560
 also tell you one thing I wanted 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.090
 in short take advantage of this video 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.540
 quite short so they don't have you 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.850
 given so much to tell you that I'm thinking 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.080
 in fact I've already decided to open up 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.690
 I have already talked about a forum on facebook 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.300
 asked opinions and was unanimous 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.460
 decided that the idea is good 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.180
 that will have to do so etc. 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.550
 etc 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.290
 I therefore intend to integrate into the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.810
 site just a forum where you can 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.050
 discuss a little better about the various guides 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.300
 on 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.920
 in short, on the insights rather 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.450
 that other things 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.770
 I will give space to a cable and of course 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.420
 if you want to insert you too 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.050
 content if you want to ask questions 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.970
 etc. etc. 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.280
 then okay maybe I'll even invent myself 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.140
 in short, something else in the future for 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.720
 grow but then you will see naturally 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.660
 then I wanted to do nothing 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.310
 also ask you here on youtube the 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.100
 considered a good idea if 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.670
 you would actively participate in short 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.920
 forum 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.140
 and so on so let me know what 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.120
 think below in the comments you can 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.770
 naturally find me on facebook on 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.720
 site I put all the links below in 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.860
 description and nothing as usual vi 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.860
 thank you to the next
