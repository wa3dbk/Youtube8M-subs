00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
dream so we're talking low co2 emissions

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.450 
dream so we're talking low co2 emissions
low<00:00:38.489> greenhouse<00:00:38.820> gas<00:00:39.239> emissions

low greenhouse gas emissions

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.299 
low greenhouse gas emissions
it's<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.670> cleaner<00:00:41.030> safer<00:00:41.680> more<00:00:42.680> reliable<00:00:42.739> way

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
it's a cleaner safer more reliable way

to get around so you're going to have
time<00:00:45.110> savings<00:00:45.649> we're<00:00:46.370> gonna<00:00:46.460> hop<00:00:46.670> on<00:00:46.820> the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
time savings we're gonna hop on the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.970 
time savings we're gonna hop on the
train<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.270> Orlando<00:00:47.719> you'll<00:00:47.960> get<00:00:48.110> off<00:00:48.230> in<00:00:48.470> Tampa

you<00:00:49.730> can<00:00:49.910> see<00:00:50.090> them<00:00:50.180> about<00:00:50.360> 50%<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.050> their<00:00:51.230> time

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
you can see them about 50% of their time

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.650 
you can see them about 50% of their time
he<00:00:52.040> put<00:00:52.219> my<00:00:52.370> driving<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.149> know<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.390> will

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
he put my driving and you know you will

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.970 
he put my driving and you know you will
get<00:00:53.780> there<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.079> time<00:00:54.110> that's<00:00:54.620> one<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
get there on time that's one of the

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.430 
get there on time that's one of the
things<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.280> know

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
allow all that extra time for traffic

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.750 
allow all that extra time for traffic
it's<00:00:57.899> also<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.199> great<00:00:58.379> economic<00:00:58.680> driver<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.699> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's also a great economic driver so you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.139 
it's also a great economic driver so you
can<00:00:59.940> expect<00:01:00.239> tens<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.750> thousands<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> new<00:01:01.469> jobs

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
can expect tens of thousands of new jobs

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.460 
can expect tens of thousands of new jobs
billions<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.269> dollars<00:01:03.629> per<00:01:03.930> year<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.140> revenue

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
billions of dollars per year in revenue

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
billions of dollars per year in revenue
not<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> build<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> actual<00:01:05.790> system<00:01:06.240> but

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
not just to build the actual system but

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.340 
not just to build the actual system but
also<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.080> happens

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
also it happens

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.440 
also it happens
actually<00:01:08.890> built<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:09.520> we're<00:01:10.180> talking<00:01:10.270> about

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
actually built so we're talking about

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.850 
actually built so we're talking about
transit-oriented<00:01:11.110> development<00:01:11.710> these<00:01:11.799> are

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
transit-oriented development these are

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.810 
transit-oriented development these are
city<00:01:12.250> centers

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
city centers

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.360 
city centers
retail<00:01:14.810> development<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.470> prop<00:01:15.710> up<00:01:15.890> around<00:01:16.190> my
