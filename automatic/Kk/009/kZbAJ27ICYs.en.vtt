is a TV screen monitor in the background
and<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.329> weird<00:00:33.840> stuff<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.800> here

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and a lot of weird stuff going on here

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.410 
and a lot of weird stuff going on here
so<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> look<00:00:36.059> closely<00:00:36.950> they<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.550> whole

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so if you look closely they have a whole

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.229 
so if you look closely they have a whole

options create new world game mode you
can<00:00:49.920> change<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.789> look<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.000> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
can change all that but look at this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
can change all that but look at this
there<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> new<00:00:51.690> slot<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.770> says<00:00:52.949> texture

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
there is a new slot and it says texture

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
there is a new slot and it says texture
packs<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.420> off<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.719> side<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> says

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
packs and then off to the side it says

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
packs and then off to the side it says
interface<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> shows<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> every<00:00:57.030> single

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
interface and it shows you every single

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
interface and it shows you every single
block<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> game<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.699> know

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
block in the game so that way you know

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240 
block in the game so that way you know
what<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> go

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
what it's going to look like when you go

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
what it's going to look like when you go
into<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> game<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.420> texture<00:01:03.809> pack

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
into the game with your texture pack

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.289 
into the game with your texture pack
really<00:01:04.350> cool<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.119> there's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
really cool so as you can see there's

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
really cool so as you can see there's
only<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.689> texture<00:01:07.650> pack<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.010> their<00:01:08.159> texture

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
only one texture pack in their texture

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.830 
only one texture pack in their texture
packs<00:01:08.670> lot<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> obvious

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
packs lot and that is the obvious

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
packs lot and that is the obvious
default<00:01:10.830> texture<00:01:11.250> pack<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.119> all

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
default texture pack as you can see all

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
default texture pack as you can see all
the<00:01:12.270> blocks<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> same<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.100> maybe<00:01:14.280> as

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the blocks are just the same so maybe as

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
the blocks are just the same so maybe as
you<00:01:14.760> purchase<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:16.049> fill<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you purchase them it will fill up that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.820 
you purchase them it will fill up that
slot<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> look<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.790> across<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
slot and you can look over go across and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
slot and you can look over go across and
everything<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.040> start<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.369> change<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
everything will start a change in that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.399 
everything will start a change in that
picture<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> you'll<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.350> able

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
picture right there and you'll be able

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
picture right there and you'll be able
to<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> texture<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> entire<00:01:23.939> world

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
to see the texture of the entire world

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
to see the texture of the entire world
it's<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.320> great<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:25.890> loving<00:01:26.280> how

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
it's going to be great I'm loving how

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.620 
it's going to be great I'm loving how
they're<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> instead<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.450> like

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they're doing that instead of just like

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.149 
they're doing that instead of just like
not<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.080> no<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.500> hope<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
not really no one hope and that's the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
not really no one hope and that's the
texture<00:01:29.520> pack<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.030> wanting<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
texture pack that you're wanting and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
texture pack that you're wanting and
clicking<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.400> can

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
clicking it and it's not you can

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
clicking it and it's not you can
actually<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.570> every<00:01:34.049> single<00:01:34.409> block

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
actually see what every single block

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.219 
actually see what every single block
looks<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.630> select<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
looks like and then you can select that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
looks like and then you can select that
texture<00:01:37.740> pack<00:01:37.920> knowing<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> one

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
texture pack knowing but that's the one

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
texture pack knowing but that's the one
you<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.170> there's<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.070> info<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.700> you
