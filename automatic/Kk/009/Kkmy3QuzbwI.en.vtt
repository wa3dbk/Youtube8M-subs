00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 may I ask your attention for just a moment 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.370
 my new foundation de linda 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.930
 foundation 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.240
 one in nine children in the Netherlands 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.769
 grows up in poverty and of course 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 these children have a roof over them 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.110
 head and they get food from the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.839
 food Bank 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.340
 but everything is said with that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 their often single mothers live 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 constant with the worries and the stress or 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.350
 they do have money for the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 energy bill 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 school supplies shoes and bike all 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.710
 dead normal things for most 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 dutch children 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.040
 what does it do to you as a child like you 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 mother you on your birthday but not with you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 let school go because they don't have any 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.410
 can pay for the class or treat 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 if you can never give a game 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.550
 and also can not go to parties and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 how do you feel as a mother like you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.660
 children can never put their shoe 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.920
 If you never do that you can buy that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.570
 they like it so much 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.710
 if you are unable to have your child 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.719
 let exercise 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 to go on a school trip one 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 and give you a good warm jacket 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.059
 Always count how you are up to 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.590
 the end of the month 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 food and detergent for example 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.719
 I would love to buy this new one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.240
 foundation to start in the month 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.430
 December thousand of this kind of families 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 children want under 18 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 surprise with a gift 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 we give them a nice box with it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.080
 gift cards from albert heijn de hema 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.080
 intertoys and c &amp; a worth 600 euros 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 That means 50 euros extra in a year 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.409
 the month and that may not seem 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.320
 a lot but if you are a mother with two 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.299
 children only have 280 euros per month 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 to buy everything from clothes to food 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.380
 everything then i'm sure they will be there 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 happy to be with it and maybe that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.630
 just the difference can be between it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.280
 not save financially and save it 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 and now the special thing about linda van 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.950
 dation 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.869
 because I personally all general 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.920
 I can pay you the costs of the foundation 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.170
 really guarantee that at least 100 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 percent of your gift to the families 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 ends up 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.799
 and why at least 100 percent sounds that way 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.840
 as if you give can also be more 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.060
 and yes that is true and that is because 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.909
 Companies such as Albert Heijn Intertoys 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.710
 Hema and C&amp;A are willing to do more 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.989
 put value on those giftcards then 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 we will pay you for it because they do this 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.980
 nice initiative in the we can 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.670
 every 100 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.610
 maybe about 120 120 about you or who 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.840
 knows how to make 130 euros and what would I do 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.690
 great as we are coming 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.190
 1000 Dutch families already 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.540
 can surprise 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.519
 I mainly address all those mothers 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.560
 from the Netherlands who are capable of 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.900
 children carefree happy childhood too 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.819
 give them a hot meal every day 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.739
 table can put something tasty in the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.360
 school bag can stop and sometime with 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.769
 their daughter can go into town for 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.769
 a new pair of jeans or mascara 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.849
 and that of the holidays always something 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.430
 can make something special 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.530
 I hope you want to show solidarity 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.840
 with all those mothers in the Netherlands who do this 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.629
 kind of things can not do go to the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160
 site of the linda of this and give something 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.940
 5 Euro 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.150
 25 euros 100 euros each amount is good and 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.730
 once again every euro remains one anyway 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.950
 euro and will most likely be more 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.599
 and will be very good in all cases 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.599
