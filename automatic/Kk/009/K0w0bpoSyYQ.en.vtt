down again last night it was too dark
normally<00:02:05.520> find<00:02:05.729> anything<00:02:06.229> but<00:02:07.229> I've<00:02:07.910> managed

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
normally find anything but I've managed

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.699 
normally find anything but I've managed
to<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> actual<00:02:09.330> frame<00:02:09.750> together<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.290> so

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to get the actual frame together now so

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.430 
to get the actual frame together now so
now<00:02:11.040> i'm<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> start<00:02:11.580> fetching<00:02:11.850> it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.050 

I<00:02:20.920> think<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> hardest<00:02:22.250> bit<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.580> making<00:02:22.940> these

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I think the hardest bit of making these

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.650 
I think the hardest bit of making these
shelters<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.690> finding<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.350> actual<00:02:25.450> some<00:02:26.450> wood

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
shelters is finding the actual some wood

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.820 
shelters is finding the actual some wood
which<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:27.230> enough<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.470> them<00:02:35.680> all<00:02:36.680> right

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
which is good enough for them all right

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.490 
which is good enough for them all right
ever<00:02:37.210> done<00:02:38.210> quite<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> bit<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.930> action<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.410> it

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
ever done quite a bit of action on it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.710 
ever done quite a bit of action on it
now<00:02:39.650> i'll<00:02:40.550> show<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.910> what<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.090> looks<00:02:41.120> like

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.690

going to sort of make a couple of extra
ones<00:03:47.480> going<00:03:47.630> down<00:03:47.780> here<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.410> there's<00:03:48.560> going<00:03:48.680> to

and more social and stuff are you want
to<00:04:00.980> share<00:04:01.160> on<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.550> side<00:04:01.760> I'm<00:04:02.060> sure<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:04.190> we've

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
to share on the side I'm sure so we've

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.250 
to share on the side I'm sure so we've
done<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.540> usual<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:07.750> spruce<00:04:08.750> thatching<00:04:09.140> on

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
done the usual and spruce thatching on

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.170 
done the usual and spruce thatching on
it<00:04:09.350> maybe<00:04:10.040> I'll<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.280> see<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> few<00:04:10.610> ferns<00:04:10.850> there

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
it maybe I'll to see a few ferns there

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.960 
it maybe I'll to see a few ferns there
they<00:04:11.360> were<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:12.370> we<00:04:13.370> were<00:04:13.430> going<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.670> use<00:04:13.790> them

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
they were just we were going to use them

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.240 
they were just we were going to use them
initially<00:04:14.510> but<00:04:14.690> then<00:04:14.750> decided<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.130> because

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
initially but then decided that because

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.710 
initially but then decided that because
when<00:04:16.640> they<00:04:16.729> die<00:04:16.880> offs<00:04:17.060> leaders<00:04:17.330> shrivel<00:04:17.630> up

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
when they die offs leaders shrivel up

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.420 
when they die offs leaders shrivel up
quite<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.350> lot<00:04:18.560> they're<00:04:18.799> practically<00:04:19.130> useless

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
quite a lot they're practically useless

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.250 
quite a lot they're practically useless
so<00:04:21.010> if<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.540> probably<00:04:23.690> see<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.930> roundness

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
so if you can probably see the roundness

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.290 
so if you can probably see the roundness
of<00:04:24.440> shape<00:04:24.680> we've<00:04:24.830> put<00:04:24.979> lots<00:04:25.190> of<00:04:25.370> stuff<00:04:25.940> over

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
of shape we've put lots of stuff over

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.890 
of shape we've put lots of stuff over
the<00:04:26.419> cross<00:04:28.270> crossing<00:04:29.270> sticks<00:04:29.479> at<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.690> top

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
the cross crossing sticks at the top

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.290 
the cross crossing sticks at the top
because<00:04:30.110> they<00:04:30.410> often<00:04:30.680> let<00:04:30.950> in<00:04:31.040> water<00:04:31.300> those

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
because they often let in water those

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.790 
because they often let in water those
ones<00:04:32.419> they're<00:04:32.660> still<00:04:32.900> open<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:33.229> they<00:04:33.530> Moline

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
ones they're still open but they Moline

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.280 
ones they're still open but they Moline
may<00:04:34.040> lead<00:04:34.430> mainly<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.120> front<00:04:35.479> so<00:04:36.169> that's

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
may lead mainly to the front so that's

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.469 
may lead mainly to the front so that's
not<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.590> ensure<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> problem<00:04:37.250> we've<00:04:38.150> built<00:04:38.360> it

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
not to ensure a problem we've built it

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.190 
not to ensure a problem we've built it
quite<00:04:38.660> an<00:04:38.720> extra<00:04:38.990> yew<00:04:39.169> tree<00:04:39.380> here<00:04:41.200> those

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
quite an extra yew tree here those

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.230 
quite an extra yew tree here those
there's<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:42.919> i<00:04:43.250> know<00:04:43.280> people<00:04:43.970> will<00:04:44.030> say
