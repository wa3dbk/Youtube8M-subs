00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hello everyone knows by the way

 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.980
 found today on the presentation 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.750
 of the skin gta 5 / euro truck simulator 2 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.090
 and I quickly make a small 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.370
 dedication to florian bourges and or borg and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.170
 who provided me the skin on facebook so 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.170
 I thank him for going let's go 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.490
 and so here we go we go for the 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.930
 presentation of this famous skin so everything 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.560
 first I think you can imagine 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.180
 it's really really for you 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.830
 will like the skin anyway but that's 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.080
 true that those who love it range think 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.640
 really those who love gta 5 after 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.650
 you will see that you do not have to 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.840
 necessarily love gta 5 to like it because 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.120
 that the skin I find it really great 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.440
 pretty short I stop doing myself 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.330
 wait I ask all of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.620
 suite so here's the skin so wait 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.050
 it may be necessary to put a small 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.120
 refit his truck that will make it anyway 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.309
 definitely better 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.050
 so that's what it looks like 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.940
 skin so people will already have it 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.700
 noticed we have franklyn on the right 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.020
 and there we michael on the left finally 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.720
 rather the opposite brief end you have me 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.400
 included in the back we have very strong so 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.620
 this is really very classy 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.409
 with the little acronym gta 5 on the 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.240
 careening finally really it's really 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.979
 super class the little rockstar logo and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.390
 so it's really for people who 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.680
 like gta it will please them 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.440
 after you do not necessarily need 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 but I was at because the skin in 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.340
 himself is really very pretty I 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.540
 find the colors nice base all 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.759
 just the colors a little bit 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.170
 sunset like that it changes a 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.820
 little bit I find that class with the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.710
 terrace palms is really very very 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.630
 very pretty i will show you everything from 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.390
 what it looks like on my truck 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.969
 because I deny them so there 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.369
 you already see it my little truck 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.500
 so wait till we go out and then I 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.240
 show you this live so here at 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.170
 what does my truck look like apart from 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.329
 skin gta 5 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.700
 there is no other mode ie 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.380
 that they all have origin 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.880
 here I preferred to put the retro ones in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.829
 chrome and if you want you can 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.360
 put the retro bread 1 what you 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.490
 will once again put a little bit more 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.000
 of gta 5 on your truck while 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.800
 simply 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.160
 and if not, that's all the rest 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.750
 of origin so here is a little bit what 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.450
 you can do so if you add 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.100
 still fashion accessories etc 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.200
 it can really give something 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.700
 very very classy go anyway me 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.350
 I will tell you the next I hope that 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.030
 this mode will have made you happy if 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.010
