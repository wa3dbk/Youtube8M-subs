00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.969
 Hello, friends 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:15.990
 asked by a person who sees 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.170
 in youtube permanent advertising of some 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.000
 green card lottery services and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.350
 however much advertising I do not see 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.130
 I have no such thing here but 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.960
 advertising after all she is so directed 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 yes that is they can by country there 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.030
 let's say maybe they are in america tu 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 advertising does not give as it makes no sense give 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 somewhere there outside 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.020
 and you see her and the person asks 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 tell me now 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.340
 lottery it will not be but in October and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.160
 why some services why right 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.160
 now and so on it means that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 hypothetically let's say a year ago 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 yes the same thing happened although there was no 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.829
 it is clear whether the lottery at all yes then 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 there is as it were because I will not 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.829
 more but nonetheless at the very moment 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.469
 when most likely it seemed that inside 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:16.999
 there will be no such aggravated 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:21.149
 means appeal to the citizens so that they 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.110
 participated in the lottery and participate participation 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.490
 this 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.050
 Well, as if very conditional because for 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.180
 In order to participate in the lottery 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.730
 go to the site which is for this 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.750
 state and there for free 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.070
 fill in the form 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 but these services are advertised 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 they take money they take money for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.430
 that they carry you somewhere 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 its that database and then it means when 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.530
 there will be a lottery not there you look there 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.479
 somewhere or yes or no there will send no 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.590
 send I do not know 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.780
 but basically i can't give 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.450
 legal assessment i mean i can't 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.090
 say it 's something real 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.800
 cheating i can't i don't 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.080
 competent in this but nothing 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.320
 to the participation of the battery green card is not 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.300
 but it is designed for someone 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.580
 who don't even know what people are 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.320
 who are a little aware they know that 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.540
 no intermediaries are needed for this 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.370
 you just need to fill the bag and sometimes 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.560
 people who are hard to fill in a mold 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.540
 they can turn in absolutely any 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.019
 there is a travel agency for a dollar the author is not 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.670
 Knowing how many of the funny money 4 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.860
 competent person fill this mold 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.360
 that's all 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.270
 so 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.460
 these are those who know those who do not know 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.190
 accordingly they will take the ladies 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.380
 a few hundred dollars for this for all 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.410
 maybe more will take why now 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.020
 it happens because the aggravation 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.620
 political situation and there we see and 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.110
 Russia and Ukraine and if people are more 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.690
 suspicious or there are careful and they 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.090
 wondering there and who's next 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.980
 Well, that will be an hour of euphoria about 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.490
 Crimea is necessary somehow to support her 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.140
 Well, who will be next so here I am with people 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.750
 talk different places I have a circle 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.470
 communication is wide here and there let's say from 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.570
 Kazakhstan people are worried and out 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.570
 Baltic also concern I have here is, 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.170
 let's go to din wrote and here you are 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.530
 there are some demonstrations there 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.530
 pass 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.849
 and it's uncomfortable, even that he was about himself 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.469
 Russian because you do not agree and 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.200
 outraged him there are some wrong 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:51.870
 people they do not want to learn the language 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.579
 so it requires here and they say as if not 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.030
 did not lead because generally Russian on 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:01.219
 account to keep expelling there and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.219
 depends on the degree how to say 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.490
 Well, the nervousness of a man to find him 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.260
 able to figure out calm whatever 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.080
 whether there is anything like that and all the chest 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.270
 okay don't usually start and here in 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.550
 Generally there is a reason yes there is a lot myself 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.730
 considerations in favor of there and years and 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.560
 here is some number of people who 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.020
 you may not think before now think 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.970
 that's it that's where it's time to blame or what are they 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.500
 everyone there thinks and since they are not in 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.810
 course from this there only in the head 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.460
 it's time to bring down 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.770
 honoring start to react somehow 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.610
 respond here to these ads in 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:42.660
 principle, usually if you go some 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.240
 advertising campaign and there is no return 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.600
 no people stop well, that's understandable 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.570
 that demand is not the other way around successfully 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.220
 got it here it went and money 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.270
 gone then starts maybe 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.250
 expand there somehow 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.650
 to win back the amounts that can be there 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.600
 earn therefore if this company with 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.330
 green cards for example lasting 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.620
 she doesn't go anywhere for a long time 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.000
 all this with her it means there 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.100
 earn some money that is 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.020
 people come to these websites there 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.210
 fills out form make there some kind of there 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.090
 I do not know how many two hundred three hundred and 500 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.960
 dollars somewhere registered there 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.310
 most likely so here is my understanding I am not 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.210
 I do not deal specifically with these matters 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.520
 carries this much I do not know this and 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.569
 common sense reasons 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.810
 yeah i like that so here so what but coming back 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.800
 to the original topic when you see that 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.740
 someone advertises 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.550
 participate in the green card well, just go away 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.190
 and everything is well 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.560
 but you do not need one at all well, just 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:52.199
 no one is needed and those who are advertised 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.300
 do it in order to cut down 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.599
 as if not earned loot so let's say 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.009
 Once again, I'm not saying that this is a circuit 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.690
 criminal just talking about what 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.909
 if there is a service that stands there 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.280
 let's say if you search you can 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:09.120
 be done for 50 dollars and if you 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.630
 found then maybe 500 so therefore 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.139
 that's still growing my understanding I 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.830
 understand 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.830
 is happy
