you<00:05:21.490> see<00:05:21.670> I<00:05:21.700> used<00:05:22.000> exactly<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.780> same<00:05:23.050> form<00:05:23.500> and

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
you see I used exactly the same form and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.520 
you see I used exactly the same form and
exactly<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.880> same<00:05:25.090> chords<00:05:25.600> I<00:05:25.720> just<00:05:25.930> did<00:05:26.440> a

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
exactly the same chords I just did a

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.950 
exactly the same chords I just did a
little<00:05:26.650> different<00:05:27.130> melody<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:27.810> that's<00:05:28.810> how

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
little different melody so that's how

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.260 
little different melody so that's how
you<00:05:29.020> can<00:05:29.260> build<00:05:29.650> on<00:05:29.920> improvisation<00:05:30.550> x'<00:05:31.030> and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
you can build on improvisation x' and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.260 
you can build on improvisation x' and
get<00:05:31.480> take<00:05:32.470> it<00:05:32.590> very<00:05:32.830> simple<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.490> then<00:05:34.060> get<00:05:34.240> a

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
get take it very simple and then get a

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.000 
get take it very simple and then get a
little<00:05:34.300> more<00:05:34.540> complex<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.350> eventually<00:05:35.890> you

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
little more complex and eventually you

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.630 
little more complex and eventually you
can<00:05:36.250> improvise<00:05:37.470> as<00:05:38.470> much<00:05:38.740> as<00:05:38.890> you<00:05:39.010> want<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.370> so

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
can improvise as much as you want to so
