00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you have the sense when you're on this

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
you have the sense when you're on this
island<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.550> shouldn't<00:01:02.940> really<00:01:03.089> be<00:01:03.210> there

island that it shouldn't really be there

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.410 
island that it shouldn't really be there
it's<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.430> place<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> sprung

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it's the kind of place like it sprung

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.910 
it's the kind of place like it sprung
out<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.960> middle<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> ocean<00:01:07.740> and

out from the middle of the ocean and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.780 
out from the middle of the ocean and
it's<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> mistake<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:11.549> first

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
it's like a mistake kind of the first

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
Polynesians who who came there after

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.550 
Polynesians who who came there after
hundreds<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> years<00:01:15.390> being<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.320> lost

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
hundreds of years being there they lost

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.130 
hundreds of years being there they lost
the<00:01:16.860> memory<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:18.810> came

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the memory of that they actually came

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.029 
the memory of that they actually came
from<00:01:19.320> somewhere<00:01:19.680> else

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
from somewhere else

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.830 
from somewhere else
and<00:01:20.130> they<00:01:20.399> thought<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> earth<00:01:21.360> like

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and they thought this was the earth like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.160 
and they thought this was the earth like
this<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:24.659> name<00:01:24.869> for

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
this was all there was and the name for

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.300 
this was all there was and the name for
the<00:01:25.229> island

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the island

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
the island
it<00:01:26.759> means<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.330> land<00:01:27.659> means<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.250> our

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it means like land means you know our

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:39.470 
it means like land means you know our
planet<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.240> way

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.030 

the<00:01:40.480> earth<00:01:40.900> there<00:01:41.260> is<00:01:41.470> made<00:01:41.680> from<00:01:41.890> many

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
the earth there is made from many

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.340 
the earth there is made from many
different<00:01:42.250> things<00:01:42.660> all<00:01:43.660> of<00:01:43.840> its<00:01:43.960> volcanic

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
different things all of its volcanic

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.640 
different things all of its volcanic
right<00:01:45.070> but<00:01:45.940> there's<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.180> few<00:01:46.390> stones<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:47.620> are

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
right but there's a few stones that are

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.500 
right but there's a few stones that are
the<00:01:47.950> moai<00:01:48.130> are<00:01:48.310> made<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:49.000> are<00:01:49.120> different

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
the moai are made of that are different

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.440 
the moai are made of that are different
but<00:01:50.110> they<00:01:50.200> don't<00:01:50.410> know<00:01:50.500> what<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.800> quite<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:51.280> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
but they don't know what it quite it is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020 
but they don't know what it quite it is
so<00:01:52.450> could<00:01:52.960> be<00:01:53.110> crystal<00:01:53.860> or<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:54.910> know

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
so could be crystal or you know

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.120 
so could be crystal or you know
something<00:01:55.480> unique<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:56.020> think<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.650> comes<00:01:56.890> also

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
something unique I think it comes also

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.370 
something unique I think it comes also
from<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.730> just<00:01:58.270> literally<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.750> isolation

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
from the just literally the isolation

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.180 
from the just literally the isolation
you<00:01:59.740> really<00:02:00.190> feel<00:02:00.460> like<00:02:00.490> you're<00:02:01.620> so<00:02:02.620> far<00:02:02.650> from

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
you really feel like you're so far from

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.640 
you really feel like you're so far from
every<00:02:03.790> direction<00:02:03.940> it's<00:02:04.360> five<00:02:04.690> hours<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:05.290> a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
every direction it's five hours on a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:16.370 
every direction it's five hours on a
plane<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.310> any<00:02:06.460> other<00:02:06.730> land

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.680 

the<00:02:17.380> place<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.980> tropical<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.510> has

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the place is tropical you know it has

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.590 
the place is tropical you know it has
bright<00:02:20.350> sunlight<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.130> palm<00:02:21.370> trees<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
bright sunlight and palm trees but I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.780 
bright sunlight and palm trees but I
agree<00:02:22.960> there<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.470> quality<00:02:24.400> about<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
agree there is this quality about the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.870 
agree there is this quality about the
island<00:02:25.180> which<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:26.070> well<00:02:27.070> it's<00:02:27.220> dark<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:27.730> it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
island which is well it's dark but it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.930 
island which is well it's dark but it's
also<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.570> curious<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.440> know<00:02:29.560> it's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
also it's curious you know it's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.510 
also it's curious you know it's
foreboding<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.620> all<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> palette<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.460> the

foreboding and all of the palette of the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.700 
foreboding and all of the palette of the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
drawings are these very sort of dark

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.910 
drawings are these very sort of dark
greens<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.580> deep<00:02:37.270> blue<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.990> some<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
moai were painted in blue obviously the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.830 
moai were painted in blue obviously the
Moi's<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.440> blue<00:02:41.740> but<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.330> quality<00:02:43.570> of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
Moi's not blue but the the quality of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.240 
Moi's not blue but the the quality of
the<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.880> place<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:47.170> sunlight<00:02:47.650> feels<00:02:47.980> a

little bit in shadow you know and so

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.240 
little bit in shadow you know and so
it's<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.540> strange<00:02:52.840> quality
