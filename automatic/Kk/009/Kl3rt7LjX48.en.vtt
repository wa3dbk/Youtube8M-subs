Calvin<00:01:26.430> you'll<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.659> cool<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
Calvin you'll see how cool that will is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
Calvin you'll see how cool that will is
by<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> cogs<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> wheel<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
by the cogs that are on that wheel it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
by the cogs that are on that wheel it
keeps<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> project<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> surface

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
keeps the project make the surface

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
keeps the project make the surface
facing<00:01:33.240> pool<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.960> well<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> wheel<00:01:34.590> itself

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
facing pool as well as the wheel itself

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
facing pool as well as the wheel itself
so<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.430> any<00:01:35.490> friction<00:01:35.880> well

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so you don't get any friction well

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.359 
so you don't get any friction well
that's<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.080> then<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.830> don't<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.859 
that's good because then I don't have to
worry<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:38.549> heating<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.149> paint<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.720> my
