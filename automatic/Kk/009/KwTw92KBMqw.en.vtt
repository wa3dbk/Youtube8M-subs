00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.309
 personal beauty add salomon and 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:19.349
 guitarist then here to speak to the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.610
 Respect for versatility is an aspect of 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.430
 little different the staff usually 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.689
 address here I'm using is one of the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.130
 my guitars one of mine 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 main guitars 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.829
 I'm wearing on the arm a yes more 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.170
 nine rays and on the bridge I'm using a 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 error 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 with 59 everyone knows as a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.880
 hunter joker, he goes from 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.890
 light tones up to two servings 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.079
 relatively heavy and really 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 passionate versatile 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 I have here in the military application for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 example I use despite the scavengers 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.090
 despite being two boxes I will find 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 five positions why because she told me 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 gave this activity in relation to the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 had to move will find the ability to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.850
 chávez not always full of these buttons 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.450
 things that do not say how I 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:26.219
 I have here that I have of the position 11 59 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:28.799
 and mails full in position 2 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.499
 I have only a silly 59 rails in the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.459
 eurozone not then team changes 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.459
 quite come 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.010
 changing the position of the alloy 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.940
 course is very much more magnificent 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.740
 stronger 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.480
 The same applies to positions 5 in 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:05.710
 that I have the mistake 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:06.970
 full of harmonics including the key in the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:17.709
 position 4 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:21.430
 I have only one flag to fight for 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:27.270
 true and also modifies quite useful 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.270
 adding this to for example has 59 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.840
 per share 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.080
 sounds more like the mood control 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.080
 I have 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:48.360
 to the team was reassembled from absolutely the 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:08.049
 people get their hair filled with error 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.989
 usually the taster used as a 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 reference on sun guitars in her 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.620
 difference of iva is seen then is I can 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.750
 I have even less 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.540
 all without that bunch of keys. 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.709
 complained of suites respected in 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.859
 guitar 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.510
 It's a detail I'd like to pass on. 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.250
 for you it is the following in my 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.650
 volume contracts 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.239
 I always use or the tablet connection 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.459
 because I think it's important that I 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.340
 I work very dynamically and I 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.569
 a lot of sweat work invented to make the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.969
 change the effects you are using 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.400
 here are some gear ratios 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:17.070
 thomason ice 1 million even use 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.620
 but do not turn off extortion and movement 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.620
 to guitar sound without injury 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.849
 so the dynamics are very important 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 usually when you see below volume 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:45.320
 tablets is because the volume happens 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.150
 decreases but adults also decrease 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:54.810
 cramp 10 ticket you do not have I am 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.560
 a dna horse fashion little height that 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.419
 you use 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.419
 if you use it when I got the game here 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.199
 What I think is very important, right? 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.240
 When we work with this type of 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.499
 dynamics to keep the originated 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.169
 correct guitar 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.009
 so we want this I'll post it on 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.449
 group 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.909
 soon after the 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.639
 People can have this video and I'll show them 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.409
 The link I use here is a key. 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.639
 five male key five positions 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:37.669
 conventional in which I can use to 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.580
 the scavengers both one with a girl only 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.860
 As with the two coils, he does not 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.039
 if it was a sim né ii love module that 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.840
 also occupies this connection and I also go 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.879
 leave the tablet layout with you there 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.229
 for you to get the control and your 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.330
 new control is ok 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.330
 A hug and see you next
