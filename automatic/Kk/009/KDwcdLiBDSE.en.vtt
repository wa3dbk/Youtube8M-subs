00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 some suggestions 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.330
 a good ceviche 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.500
 my name is vÃ­ctor lopez 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.500
 I'm the restaurant's executive chef 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.110
 let's start 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.080
 taking 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.280
 in this case we will see 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.280
 cool and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.039
 let's put it in a warehouse 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.250
 and we will add it 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.790
 lemon salt pepper and oregano so that 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.790
 take a taste 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 and we're going to let it rest around 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.579
 25 to 30 minutes 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.579
 until I'm already with a little bit 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.670
 can see that the color changes little to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 little bit 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.040
 while while spending your time in 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.040
 repose 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.900
 We will wait around 15-20 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.810
 minutes to have the fish in this 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.920
 consistency 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 and in this color 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.769
 so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.769
 let's remove the fish 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.440
 the game 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.550
 we are going to add the deposit 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.550
 where are we going to mix 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.280
 we can add 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.330
 at the discretion of our taste 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.960
 garlic oil oil is a flavors like 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.600
 those who are leaving now that they have 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.420
 herbs that they have right now I 'm going 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.840
 to add peppers chopped finely 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840
 colors 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.090
 and arrived with another team we are going to 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.090
 return 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.260
 let's add 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.260
 and a little bit of 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.880
 in this case I'm going to put parsley 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.690
 you can put chopped vegetables can 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.690
 put thyme 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.819
 the parsley will give them a more flavor 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.750
 cool 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.200
 to the bite of a flavor more more 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.200
 delicate 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.430
 a little olive oil 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.639
 let's rectify salt 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.040
 remember that I already had salt in the 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.540
 Marinated since it is only going to 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.540
 put to season the vegetables 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.870
 a little more defining 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.240
 and regulates 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.560
 it's a plate 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.949
 typical in many Latin cultures 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.199
 especially those that have an island 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:47.860
 are the coasts of those you walk to 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:52.810
 republic repeat of mexico 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.210
 colombia have their own sayings 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.639
 Mexicans are made with spicy 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.240
 Colombian rights are made 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.680
 with yellow pepper 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.410
 Colombians have a red angel in 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.410
 conclusion for us dedicate this 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.610
 normally wherever there is an island it will 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.469
 there is a ceviche 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.469
 we are going to mount the plate already to finish 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.920
 help of a large spoon of tricks 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.400
 as well as now 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.630
 we have here 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.630
 let's go before them 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.400
 your text 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.040
 we clean the edges we see our 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.040
 trail 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.520
 Y 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.520
 yes 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.650
 two
