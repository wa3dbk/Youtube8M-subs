in you know just the sort of player
messi<00:01:36.719> of<00:01:36.990> course<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:38.249> yeah<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.490> don't

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
which is really really cool I think we

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.289 
which is really really cool I think we
get<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> fair<00:01:44.639> decent<00:01:44.850> amount<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
get you know a fair decent amount of

players you know not no one's special of

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.620 
players you know not no one's special of
course<00:01:47.670> knowing<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.240> bag<00:01:48.359> us<00:01:48.539> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
course knowing that kind of bag us a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.770 
course knowing that kind of bag us a
load<00:01:48.749> of<00:01:48.869> coins<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.179> do<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> fair<00:01:51.659> few

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
load of coins but we do get a fair few

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
load of coins but we do get a fair few
gold<00:01:51.990> players<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.469> Ramsey<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.119> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
gold players like the Ramsey there and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.819 
gold players like the Ramsey there and
then<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:54.600> couple<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> Italian<00:01:55.380> players<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
then a couple of Italian players in the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
then a couple of Italian players in the
gold<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.249> gold<00:01:56.609> Brazilian<00:01:57.209> centre-back

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
gold and the gold Brazilian centre-back

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.020 
gold and the gold Brazilian centre-back
but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.079> think<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.889> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.490> end<00:01:59.670> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
but I think what we do in the end is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.300 
but I think what we do in the end is
actually<00:02:00.869> discard<00:02:01.560> most<00:02:01.859> of<00:02:01.979> them<00:02:02.100> i<00:02:02.249> do

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
actually discard most of them i do

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.249 
actually discard most of them i do
actually<00:02:02.520> send<00:02:02.909> my<00:02:03.090> trade<00:02:03.329> pole<00:02:03.539> just<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
actually send my trade pole just for the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.649 
actually send my trade pole just for the
moment<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.219> few<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.850> them<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.179> club<00:02:06.359> but

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
moment and a few of them to my club but

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.449 
moment and a few of them to my club but
i<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.229> later<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.499> in<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.039> video<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.369> will

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
i think later on in this video you will

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.250 
i think later on in this video you will
see<00:02:08.580> me<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.940> discard<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:09.630> what<00:02:10.229> i

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
see me just discard them because what i

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.990 
see me just discard them because what i

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
exciting rather than just to standard

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.860 
exciting rather than just to standard
road<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> glory<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.439> um<00:02:40.909> flat-pack<00:02:41.909> there<00:02:42.150> we

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
road to glory but um flat-pack there we

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.539

actually get John Obi mikkel and then

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.550 
actually get John Obi mikkel and then
that<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:44.909> back<00:02:45.120> there<00:02:45.329> from<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:46.200> blamin

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
that right back there from the blamin

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.619 
that right back there from the blamin
which<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.669> know<00:02:47.700> fairly<00:02:48.030> decent<00:02:48.389> but<00:02:48.510> that

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
which is you know fairly decent but that

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.539 
which is you know fairly decent but that
guy<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.079> isn't<00:02:49.409> that<00:02:49.439> too<00:02:49.739> well<00:02:50.400> isn't

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
guy really isn't that too well isn't

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.240 
guy really isn't that too well isn't
really<00:02:50.849> good<00:02:51.000> at<00:02:51.239> all<00:02:51.450> m<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.109> then<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.739> think

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
really good at all m and then I think

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.259 
really good at all m and then I think
you<00:02:53.430> know<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.549> couple<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.879> other<00:02:54.030> decent

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
you know a couple of other decent

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.629 
you know a couple of other decent
players<00:02:54.599> but<00:02:54.989> i<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:55.769> go<00:02:55.889> into<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.220> final

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
players but i think we go into the final

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.030 
players but i think we go into the final
sort<00:02:56.909> of<00:02:56.970> gold<00:02:57.239> silver<00:02:57.569> /<00:02:57.900> bronze<00:02:58.169> pack<00:02:58.439> we

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
sort of gold silver / bronze pack we

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500 
sort of gold silver / bronze pack we
don't<00:02:59.219> get<00:02:59.340> anything<00:02:59.519> really<00:02:59.790> decent<00:03:00.060> curry

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
don't get anything really decent curry

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.690 
don't get anything really decent curry
on<00:03:00.750> E<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.079> think<00:03:01.469> that's<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.680> brazilian<00:03:02.159> guy<00:03:02.340> no

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
on E I think that's the brazilian guy no

Snodgrass<00:03:08.849> so<00:03:09.209> I'm<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.629> too<00:03:09.750> sure<00:03:09.930> how<00:03:10.079> much

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
Snodgrass so I'm not too sure how much

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.259 
Snodgrass so I'm not too sure how much
that<00:03:10.469> goes<00:03:10.590> for<00:03:10.919> all<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.370> know<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.700> he<00:03:11.939> does<00:03:12.090> have

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
that goes for all I know is he does have

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.909 
that goes for all I know is he does have
80<00:03:12.510> dribbling<00:03:12.959> which<00:03:13.109> is<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.379> course<00:03:13.409> very

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
80 dribbling which is of course very

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.709 
80 dribbling which is of course very
very<00:03:14.099> good<00:03:14.219> for<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> silver<00:03:14.669> player<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.629> I

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
very good for a silver player and I

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.179 
very good for a silver player and I
think<00:03:15.930> he<00:03:16.019> could<00:03:16.200> maybe<00:03:16.409> go<00:03:16.650> for<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
think he could maybe go for like a

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.099 
think he could maybe go for like a
couple<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.639> K<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.449> will<00:03:18.569> see<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
couple of K so we will see what that

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.710 
couple of K so we will see what that
turns<00:03:19.349> out<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:20.120> be<00:03:21.120> imma<00:03:21.269> try<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.599> get

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
and probably did just start and just

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.930

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
went straight into Division five for the

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.700 
went straight into Division five for the
season<00:05:41.330> seeing<00:05:41.570> as<00:05:41.690> there<00:05:41.840> was<00:05:41.930> no<00:05:41.960> single

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
season seeing as there was no single

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.950 
season seeing as there was no single
matches<00:05:43.099> anymore<00:05:43.849> but<00:05:44.060> we<00:05:44.360> do<00:05:44.630> actually<00:05:44.720> go

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
matches anymore but we do actually go

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.890 
matches anymore but we do actually go
behind<00:05:45.380> in<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.580> think<00:05:46.669> you<00:05:46.970> know<00:05:47.180> like<00:05:47.660> it

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
behind in the I think you know like it

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.300 
behind in the I think you know like it
was<00:05:47.990> really<00:05:48.139> stupid<00:05:48.349> I<00:05:48.530> was<00:05:48.560> all<00:05:48.830> over<00:05:48.860> him<00:05:49.250> and

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
was really stupid I was all over him and

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.890 
was really stupid I was all over him and
then<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.849> was<00:05:49.970> his<00:05:50.060> first<00:05:50.240> short<00:05:50.539> and<00:05:50.690> stuff

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
then that was his first short and stuff

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.930 
then that was his first short and stuff
of<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.050> so<00:05:51.349> kind<00:05:51.860> of<00:05:51.919> annoying<00:05:52.130> but<00:05:52.430> Messi

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
of that so kind of annoying but Messi

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.180 
of that so kind of annoying but Messi
does<00:05:53.180> get<00:05:53.330> a<00:05:53.360> nice<00:05:53.539> goal<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.020> then<00:05:54.500> again<00:05:54.889> here

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
does get a nice goal and then again here

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.620 
does get a nice goal and then again here
I<00:05:55.220> think<00:05:55.310> he<00:05:55.520> does<00:05:55.669> like<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.849> roulette<00:05:56.300> kind<00:05:56.539> of

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
I think he does like a roulette kind of

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.320 
I think he does like a roulette kind of
thing<00:05:56.840> or<00:05:57.199> that<00:05:57.410> might<00:05:57.590> be<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.710> third<00:05:58.010> goal
