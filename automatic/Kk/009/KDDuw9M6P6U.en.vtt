from<00:00:55.070> winning<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.550> bowel<00:00:56.500> from<00:00:57.500> there<00:00:57.740> you

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
from winning the bowel from there you

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.140 
from winning the bowel from there you
then<00:00:58.070> choose<00:00:58.370> which<00:00:58.550> ships<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.940> want<00:00:59.090> to

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
then choose which ships you want to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.300 
then choose which ships you want to
place<00:00:59.330> down<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.630> your<00:00:59.900> bowel<00:01:00.110> you're<00:01:00.890> limited

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
place down on your bowel you're limited

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.250 
place down on your bowel you're limited
by<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.580> amount<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:02.000> pilots<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.750> have<00:01:02.990> any

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
by the amount of pilots you have any

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.079 
by the amount of pilots you have any
money<00:01:03.530> etc<00:01:03.710> for<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.309> different<00:01:04.580> challenges

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
money etc for the different challenges

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.670 
money etc for the different challenges
so<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:05.900> means<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:06.320> have<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.439> pick

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
so this means that you have to pick

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.710 
so this means that you have to pick
carefully<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.460> then<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:08.240> can<00:01:08.420> take<00:01:08.540> some

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
carefully and then it can take some

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480 
carefully and then it can take some
trial<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.170> error<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.590> whether<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.130> can<00:01:10.280> dash

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
trial and error to whether you can dash

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.340 
trial and error to whether you can dash
you<00:01:10.700> defeat<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.210> bowel<00:01:11.509> or<00:01:11.689> not<00:01:11.960> with<00:01:12.140> said

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
you defeat the bowel or not with said

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.739 
you defeat the bowel or not with said
ships<00:01:12.650> it's<00:01:13.520> also<00:01:13.700> worth<00:01:13.939> noting<00:01:14.150> that<00:01:14.359> some

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:14.749 
ships it's also worth noting that some

although perfecting your builds and
getting<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.700> perfect<00:04:51.150> fleet<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.990> get<00:04:52.169> top<00:04:52.380> of

getting the perfect fleet to get top of

getting the perfect fleet to get top of
the<00:04:52.530> leaderboards<00:04:53.039> it's<00:04:53.160> definitely

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
the leaderboards it's definitely

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.240 
the leaderboards it's definitely
satisfying<00:04:54.090> is<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.470> really<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:55.979> lot<00:04:56.160> of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
satisfying is it really is a lot of

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.920 
satisfying is it really is a lot of
trial<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.610> error<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:56.880> some<00:04:57.330> gamers<00:04:57.539> might

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
trial and error and some gamers might

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.050 
trial and error and some gamers might
not<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.169> too<00:04:58.320> into<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.789> it's<00:04:59.789> also<00:04:59.940> worth

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
not be too into that it's also worth

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.520 
not be too into that it's also worth
noting<00:05:00.330> that<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.660> game<00:05:00.840> does<00:05:01.110> include<00:05:01.320> an

noting that the game does include an
online<00:05:01.950> mode<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:03.030> way<00:05:03.150> this<00:05:03.300> works<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.750> you

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
online mode the way this works is you

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.930 
online mode the way this works is you
actually<00:05:04.229> set<00:05:04.470> up<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.710> fleet<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.220> then<00:05:05.669> build

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
actually set up a fleet and then build

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.690 
actually set up a fleet and then build
the<00:05:06.090> challenge<00:05:06.539> on<00:05:06.660> this<00:05:06.750> onto<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.229> servers

the challenge on this onto the servers
this<00:05:08.700> can<00:05:08.910> then<00:05:09.060> select<00:05:09.330> by<00:05:09.750> any<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.139> game

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
this can then select by any of the game

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.650 
this can then select by any of the game
moves<00:05:10.560> on<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.889> game<00:05:11.070> they<00:05:11.970> then<00:05:12.210> pit<00:05:12.450> their

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
moves on the game they then pit their

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.180

ships<00:05:12.960> against<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.470> challenge<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:13.950> see<00:05:14.099> if

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
ships against the challenge and see if

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.370 
ships against the challenge and see if
they<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.460> beat<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:14.720> after<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.139> can<00:05:16.229> then

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
they can beat it after that you can then

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.260 
they can beat it after that you can then
rate<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.830> challenge<00:05:17.220> by<00:05:17.400> difficulty<00:05:18.060> and

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
rate the challenge by difficulty and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.260 
rate the challenge by difficulty and

it's<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.720> cool<00:05:19.870> feature<00:05:20.110> but<00:05:20.350> it<00:05:20.440> would<00:05:20.560> have

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
it's a cool feature but it would have

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.350 
it's a cool feature but it would have
been<00:05:20.740> nice<00:05:20.920> to<00:05:20.950> see<00:05:21.280> some<00:05:21.460> direct<00:05:21.910> multiplayer

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
