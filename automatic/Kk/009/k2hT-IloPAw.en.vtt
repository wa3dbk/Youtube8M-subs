the solidoodle for you guys know I've
been<00:00:14.610> working<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.150> does<00:00:15.719> not<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.619> fan

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
been working on it does not have a fan

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
been working on it does not have a fan
to<00:00:17.550> help<00:00:17.580> cool<00:00:18.029> PLA<00:00:18.630> when<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:18.900> printing

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to help cool PLA when you're printing

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.769 
to help cool PLA when you're printing
MPLA<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.600> well

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
MPLA so what can you do about that well

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
MPLA so what can you do about that well
obviously<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.380> go<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> Thingiverse<00:00:23.250> you

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
obviously you go out the Thingiverse you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.380 
obviously you go out the Thingiverse you
find<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.850> model<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:25.289> buy<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> fan<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.970> this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
find a model and you buy a fan so this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.700 
find a model and you buy a fan so this
is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.990> 40<00:00:28.740> by<00:00:28.920> 10<00:00:29.599> Noctua<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> nice<00:00:31.380> thing

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
is a 40 by 10 Noctua and the nice thing

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
is a 40 by 10 Noctua and the nice thing
with<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.520> even<00:00:33.120> comes<00:00:33.390> with

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
with this is it actually even comes with

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.410 
with this is it actually even comes with
a<00:00:33.750> three<00:00:34.320> pin<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:35.219> two<00:00:35.489> ping<00:00:35.820> converter

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
a three pin to two ping converter

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
a three pin to two ping converter
which<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.530> lot<00:00:37.739> easier<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.280> wire

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
which will make it a lot easier to wire

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990 
which will make it a lot easier to wire
into<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> existing<00:00:39.780> board<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:41.640> actually

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
into the existing board and it actually

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.430 
into the existing board and it actually
makes<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.660> disconnect<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
makes it so you can disconnect it to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
makes it so you can disconnect it to
take<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> fan<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.129> without<00:00:44.460> having<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.149> clip

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
take the fan out without having to clip

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
take the fan out without having to clip
wires<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> future<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.520> lay

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
wires in the future if you you know lay

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.150 
wires in the future if you you know lay
things<00:00:48.090> correctly<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.320> we'll<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.800> doing<00:00:49.890> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
things correctly so we'll be doing this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
things correctly so we'll be doing this
install<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> later<00:00:51.059> date<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.289> thing

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
install at a later date but first thing

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
install at a later date but first thing
we<00:00:52.649> need<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> print<00:00:53.430> away<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.449> fan

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
we need to do is print away for this fan

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.170 
we need to do is print away for this fan
to<00:00:55.050> attach<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> printhead<00:00:56.010> let's<00:00:56.940> take<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to attach to the printhead let's take a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:03:59.830 
to attach to the printhead let's take a
look

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.750 

okay<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.230> we<00:04:01.560> have<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.980> fan<00:04:02.159> out<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.580> box

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
okay so we have the fan out of the box

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.470 
okay so we have the fan out of the box
just<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.569> guy<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.830> we<00:04:05.519> have<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.180> print

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
just little guy and we have the print

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.390 
just little guy and we have the print
which<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.930> actually<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.560> two<00:04:07.769> parts<00:04:08.069> but<00:04:08.250> for

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
which is actually in two parts but for

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.839 
which is actually in two parts but for
right<00:04:08.489> now<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:09.269> part<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.569> matters<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.849> the

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
right now the part that matters is the

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.960 
right now the part that matters is the
holo<00:04:14.209> with<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.739> little<00:04:16.739> like<00:04:17.310> groove<00:04:17.639> around

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
holo with a little like groove around

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.009 
holo with a little like groove around
the<00:04:18.120> back<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.790> kind<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.359> sits<00:04:21.600> in<00:04:21.810> and

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
the back and it just kind of sits in and

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.100 
the back and it just kind of sits in and
blows<00:04:22.229> air<00:04:22.650> down<00:04:23.550> around<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.690> print<00:04:24.930> not

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
blows air down around the print not

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.530 
blows air down around the print not
directly<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.889> so<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.180> can<00:04:27.330> cool<00:04:27.479> a

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
directly on it so that it can cool a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.320 
directly on it so that it can cool a
little<00:04:27.870> quicker<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.970> printhead

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
little quicker so that the printhead

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.439 
little quicker so that the printhead
doesn't<00:04:30.720> melt<00:04:31.130> right<00:04:32.130> what<00:04:32.370> it's<00:04:32.490> printing<00:04:32.910> on

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
doesn't melt right what it's printing on

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.990 
doesn't melt right what it's printing on
top<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.710> I'm<00:04:34.860> obviously<00:04:35.190> not<00:04:35.639> where<00:04:35.850> it's

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
top of so I'm obviously not where it's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.670 
top of so I'm obviously not where it's
printing<00:04:36.330> but<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.050> don't<00:04:37.199> want<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.530> melt

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
printing but you don't want it to melt

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.110 
printing but you don't want it to melt
the<00:04:37.830> layer<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.250> just<00:04:38.430> put<00:04:38.610> down<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.970> want

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the layer you just put down you want

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.360 
the layer you just put down you want
that<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.389> solidify<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:41.010> don't<00:04:41.130> get<00:04:41.220> like

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
that to solidify so you don't get like

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.520 
that to solidify so you don't get like
the<00:04:41.820> Leaning<00:04:42.060> Tower<00:04:42.090> of<00:04:42.479> Pisa<00:04:44.539> haha<00:04:45.539> anyways

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530

a couple of screws will screw together

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.320 
a couple of screws will screw together
and<00:05:19.789> away<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.820> go

now unfortunately when I'm printing for
the<00:05:25.500> videos<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:27.060> way<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.479> this<00:05:27.690> model<00:05:28.020> is

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
the videos the way that this model is

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.830 
the videos the way that this model is
designed<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:29.130> will<00:05:29.639> not<00:05:29.849> be<00:05:30.000> able<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.240> use<00:05:30.539> this

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
designed I will not be able to use this

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.830 
designed I will not be able to use this
on<00:05:31.289> prints<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.340> do<00:05:32.400> for<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.090> channel<00:05:33.419> because

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
on prints I do for the channel because

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.080 
on prints I do for the channel because
basically<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:35.220> sits<00:05:35.430> right<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.729> front<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
basically it sits right in front of the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.730 
basically it sits right in front of the
printhead<00:05:36.479> and<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:37.020> wouldn't<00:05:37.349> be<00:05:37.470> able<00:05:37.500> to

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
printhead and you wouldn't be able to

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.129 
printhead and you wouldn't be able to
see<00:05:37.950> anything<00:05:38.370> print<00:05:38.940> it<00:05:39.120> would<00:05:39.180> just<00:05:39.389> be<00:05:39.539> this

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
see anything print it would just be this

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.230 
see anything print it would just be this
thing<00:05:40.470> moving<00:05:40.889> back<00:05:41.099> and<00:05:41.370> forth<00:05:41.610> in<00:05:41.820> front<00:05:41.849> of

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
thing moving back and forth in front of

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.960 
thing moving back and forth in front of
the<00:05:42.570> video<00:05:42.750> so<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:43.680> probably<00:05:44.130> won't<00:05:44.340> use<00:05:44.669> it<00:05:44.849> on

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
the video so I probably won't use it on

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.000 
the video so I probably won't use it on
