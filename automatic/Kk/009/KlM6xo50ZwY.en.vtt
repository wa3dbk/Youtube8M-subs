00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.240
 so dreams and passions 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.269
 I think this is a perfect marriage . 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.470
 and this is how the company came 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:23.539
 ballet of rio de janeiro a group that I 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.089
 I always imagined having my hands 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.210
 dancers who could have a space in the 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:32.180
 labor market in rio de janeiro and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.820
 brazil how to achieve this sound 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.160
 that it was not really true dream 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.690
 this was my passion 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.359

 who had talent that is 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.019
 but in the dance had the possibility 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:02.510
 of art gets more financial difficulty 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.150
 this is the main factor 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.110
