who really want to deny scouting just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420 
who really want to deny scouting just
because<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.530> easier<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.979> wall<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.310> at

because it's a lot easier to wall in at

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.560 
because it's a lot easier to wall in at

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
at the top so I mean it's riskier you
know<00:01:34.590> certainly<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.130> susceptible<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.939> busts

speedlings speedlings just ate those
Marines<00:04:27.480> alive<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.320> don't<00:04:28.800> even<00:04:28.860> know<00:04:29.100> if<00:04:29.130> they

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
Marines alive I don't even know if they

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.040 
Marines alive I don't even know if they
actually<00:04:29.520> got<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.850> zergling<00:04:30.210> kill<00:04:30.660> between

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
actually got a zergling kill between

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.590 
actually got a zergling kill between
those<00:04:31.200> six<00:04:31.500> Marines<00:04:32.060> yeah<00:04:33.060> certainly<00:04:33.330> we're

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
those six Marines yeah certainly we're

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360 
those six Marines yeah certainly we're
at<00:04:33.660> target<00:04:33.840> firing<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.470> now<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> draw<00:04:34.950> on<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
at target firing and now I draw on the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.900 
at target firing and now I draw on the
offensive<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.780> he<00:04:37.470> going<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.680> want<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:38.010> try<00:04:38.850> to

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
offensive is he going to want to try to

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.340 
offensive is he going to want to try to
break<00:04:39.150> down<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:39.660> front<00:04:39.960> door<00:04:40.140> there's

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
break down this front door there's

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.490 
break down this front door there's
actually<00:04:40.710> only<00:04:40.770> one<00:04:41.130> marine<00:04:41.430> there<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:43.470> I

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
actually only one marine there so I

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.140 
actually only one marine there so I
actually<00:04:44.040> wonder<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:44.850> would<00:04:45.000> have<00:04:45.060> been

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
actually wonder if it would have been

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.450 
actually wonder if it would have been
worth<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:46.080> at<00:04:46.650> least<00:04:46.770> try<00:04:46.950> knocking<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
worth it to at least try knocking on the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.680 
worth it to at least try knocking on the
front<00:04:47.520> door<00:04:47.700> now<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.030> hellions<00:04:48.420> are<00:04:48.570> out

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
front door now that hellions are out

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.960 
front door now that hellions are out
they<00:04:49.560> probably<00:04:49.800> would<00:04:50.040> have<00:04:50.100> been<00:04:50.340> there<00:04:50.790> in

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
they probably would have been there in

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.490 
they probably would have been there in
time<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.330> deal<00:04:51.540> with<00:04:51.720> his<00:04:51.870> feelings<00:04:52.350> but

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
time to deal with his feelings but

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.770 
time to deal with his feelings but
nonetheless<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.910> Hellion<00:04:54.240> tech<00:04:54.450> has<00:04:54.630> been

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
nonetheless the Hellion tech has been

big<00:07:24.449> flaw<00:07:24.750> was<00:07:24.960> the<00:07:25.110> lack<00:07:25.289> of<00:07:25.319> scouting

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
big flaw was the lack of scouting

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.029 
big flaw was the lack of scouting
because<00:07:26.599> when<00:07:27.599> did<00:07:27.779> I<00:07:27.930> drew<00:07:28.139> actually<00:07:28.529> realize

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 
because when did I drew actually realize

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.450 
because when did I drew actually realize

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 
overseer and right now around maybe the

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:38.450 
overseer and right now around maybe the
820<00:07:34.620> or<00:07:34.740> 830<00:07:35.129> mark<00:07:35.430> and<00:07:36.560> yeah<00:07:37.560> he<00:07:37.770> had<00:07:37.860> no<00:07:38.039> idea
