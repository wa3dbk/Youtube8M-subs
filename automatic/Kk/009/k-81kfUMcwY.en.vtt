00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
it shows you a couple of things then you

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.939 
it shows you a couple of things then you
have<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> spare<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:26.430> ten<00:00:26.820> pick<00:00:27.119> ten<00:00:27.539> pins

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
have a spare that's ten pick ten pins

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
have a spare that's ten pick ten pins
plus<00:00:28.949> whatever<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> next<00:00:30.449> ball

plus whatever you get on the next ball

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.950 
plus whatever you get on the next ball
so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> strike<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.149> had<00:00:33.390> nine<00:00:33.690> before

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
so I got a strike so I had nine before

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
so I got a strike so I had nine before
so<00:00:34.440> plus<00:00:34.680> ten<00:00:34.950> pins<00:00:35.190> nineteen<00:00:35.700> plus<00:00:35.969> ten<00:00:36.360> more

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
so plus ten pins nineteen plus ten more

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
so plus ten pins nineteen plus ten more
for<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> strike<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.129> equals<00:00:38.460> twenty<00:00:38.850> nine

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
for the strike that equals twenty nine

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.160 
for the strike that equals twenty nine
so<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> strike<00:00:42.170> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so now I've got now with the strike you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.490 
so now I've got now with the strike you
add<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.770> plus<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> next<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.300> balls<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
add it up plus the next two balls so you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.180 
add it up plus the next two balls so you
have<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.100> strike<00:00:47.840> strike<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.350> nine<00:00:49.559> spare<00:00:49.950> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
have a strike strike and a nine spare so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.380 
have a strike strike and a nine spare so
that<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> total<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> twenty<00:00:51.360> nine

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that would be a total of twenty nine

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.130 
that would be a total of twenty nine
pins<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.800> add<00:00:52.949> upon<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.239> twenty<00:00:54.600> nine<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
pins to add upon the twenty nine so that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.520 
pins to add upon the twenty nine so that
would<00:00:55.410> come<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.920> 58<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
would come out to 58 now if I would have

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.840 
would come out to 58 now if I would have
gotten

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
gotten

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.310 
gotten
nothing<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.050> next<00:01:01.410> ball<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:02.160> nine<00:01:02.579> zero

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
nothing on this next ball for nine zero

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
nothing on this next ball for nine zero
the<00:01:04.320> next<00:01:04.619> ball<00:01:04.830> wouldn't<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.309> wood

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the next ball wouldn't have wood

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
the next ball wouldn't have wood
wouldn't<00:01:06.509> have<00:01:06.600> added<00:01:06.750> anything<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
wouldn't have added anything on so if I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
wouldn't have added anything on so if I
would<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.549> gotten<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.880> six<00:01:09.270> count<00:01:09.540> on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
would have just gotten a six count on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.649 
would have just gotten a six count on
the<00:01:09.869> next<00:01:10.140> ball<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.310> nothing<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the next ball and then nothing on that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.050 
the next ball and then nothing on that
that<00:01:13.619> would<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:14.070> six<00:01:14.369> pins<00:01:14.610> added<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that would just be six pins added to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.870 
that would just be six pins added to
that<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> would<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:16.049> come<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
that so that would actually come out to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.020 
that so that would actually come out to
94<00:01:17.880> alrighty<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
94 alrighty so there's there's the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.170 
94 alrighty so there's there's the
scoring<00:01:21.390> options<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:23.070> bowling<00:01:23.399> if<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
scoring options for for bowling if you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.740 
scoring options for for bowling if you
get<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.450> strikes<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.229> come<00:01:25.440> out<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> 300

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
get all strikes you come out with a 300

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.930 
get all strikes you come out with a 300
now<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:27.899> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> teach<00:01:28.289> you<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.940> to

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
now I'm going to teach you how to to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.859 
now I'm going to teach you how to to
keep<00:01:30.149> an<00:01:30.299> average<00:01:30.770> I'd<00:01:31.770> say<00:01:32.039> I<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.640> made<00:01:32.819> up

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
keep an average I'd say I just made up

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.070 
keep an average I'd say I just made up
numbers<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.280> for<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.670> week<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.090> had<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> for

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
numbers here for one week I had to for

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.639 
numbers here for one week I had to for
one<00:01:37.229> day<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> had<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> 33<00:01:38.340> 216<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.240> 224<00:01:39.929> that<00:01:40.530> was

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
one day I had to 33 216 and 224 that was

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.840 
one day I had to 33 216 and 224 that was
a<00:01:40.679> total<00:01:41.069> series<00:01:41.429> of<00:01:41.700> 673<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> divide<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:44.610> by

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
a total series of 673 you divide that by

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.510 
a total series of 673 you divide that by
three<00:01:45.479> games<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:46.590> near<00:01:46.800> average<00:01:47.039> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
three games and you get near average of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.630 
three games and you get near average of
224<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.289> next<00:01:49.500> day<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> came<00:01:49.860> over<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
224 so the next day I came over and I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
224 so the next day I came over and I
shot<00:01:50.970> 269<00:01:51.799> 254<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.149> 200<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.690> was<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> total

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
shot 269 254 and 200 that was a total

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.370 
shot 269 254 and 200 that was a total
series<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.420> 723<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.630> total<00:01:58.500> pins<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.330> 1396<00:02:00.380> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
series of 723 and total pins is 1396 you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.559 
series of 723 and total pins is 1396 you
divide<00:02:01.709> that<00:02:01.740> by<00:02:02.069> six<00:02:02.520> games<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> come

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
divide that by six games and you come
