plus 2y this means 90 y plus 9x minus 20
X<00:02:34.209> minus<00:02:35.170> 2y<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:36.130> equal<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.670> 0<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:38.380> means

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
X minus 2y is equal to 0 this means

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:47.130 
X minus 2y is equal to 0 this means
minus<00:02:39.730> 11x<00:02:40.720> plus<00:02:42.239> 88<00:02:43.239> y<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.489> equal<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.760> zero<00:02:46.180> we

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
minus 11x plus 88 y is equal to zero we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.550 
minus 11x plus 88 y is equal to zero we
shall<00:02:47.380> multiply<00:02:48.100> both<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.730> sides<00:02:48.910> by<00:02:49.269> -<00:02:49.959> we

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
shall multiply both the sides by - we

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.009 
shall multiply both the sides by - we
shall<00:02:50.709> divide<00:02:51.040> both<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.340> sides<00:02:51.700> by<00:02:51.970> minus<00:02:52.510> 11

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
shall divide both the sides by minus 11

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.449 
shall divide both the sides by minus 11
then<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.680> X<00:02:54.040> minus<00:02:54.660> 8<00:02:55.660> y<00:02:56.260> equals<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.430> 0

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
then we have X minus 8 y equals to 0

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.060 
then we have X minus 8 y equals to 0
this<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.329> our<00:02:58.510> equation<00:02:58.570> number<00:02:59.200> 2<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.799> now<00:03:00.040> we

this is our equation number 2 and now we

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.479 
this is our equation number 2 and now we
shall<00:03:00.430> apply<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.510> elimination<00:03:02.440> method<00:03:02.489> to

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
shall apply the elimination method to

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.690 
shall apply the elimination method to
solve<00:03:03.850> these<00:03:04.209> two<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:05.590> pair<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:05.950> equation
