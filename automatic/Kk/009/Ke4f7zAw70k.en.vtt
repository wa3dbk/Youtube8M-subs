 that is, the game will already be updated 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.060
 but I always advise you to try 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.519
 install the patch even if it is already a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:07.810
 place and let's go into what we do a nice 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.079
 copy paste ie we copy the key is a 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.069
 once copied we should start the game 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.829
 in fact, cai will be required of us 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.579
 during game start then 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:25.659
 we close the folder we just have 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:29.879

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.879
 I then resume the game with fraps 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.430
 ok to pretend the goal already a lot 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.430
 activates the first in a coma 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.210
 now but seeing in too emphatically 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.210
 against spears and will be the first Italian 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:08.650
 the exit of the game runs at random like this 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.650
 allow correct operation 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.620
 Hello 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:05:06.550
 I wanted to thank everyone for starting the 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.550
 engine now I go out 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.499
 ok said this thank you for 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.959
 attention and as a last thing I wanted 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:24.849
 thank all of me by saying you are 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:26.709
 registered for me this number is 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:31.389
 a great goal because I opened the 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:33.699
 channel on October 27th 2011 and sincerely 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.330
 I need a long time to start 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.050
 understand how to make videos 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.199
 etc. etc. 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.089
 however, after almost a year, I am 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.659
 managed to reach the height for me 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:48.039
 exorbitant of 106 writings and the number 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.629
 ante of video views is 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.409
 quite good 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:55.930
 honestly I don't aspire to have 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.059
 millions of subscribers but see that 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.249
 lying six people think that not that 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:04.149
 in the videos they don't really make it 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:07.240
 I'm glad I think I continue like this 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:11.199
 in the sense that it will not have major projects 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.269
 future for the channel ie I will continue 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.610
 download away as a video on how 

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:21.430
 download games 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:23.870
 changes partitions operating systems 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.389
 I will continue so video to say god for 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.030
 example the iphone 5 install mac here 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:32.449
 app for mac so I will continue a bit like that 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.069
 the channel is quite active ie strahm 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.259
 now they go a little slower with school 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:39.919
 but when you click on the videos there 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:42.710
 it wants a little more but it's obvious 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:45.020
 I really thank everyone from my heart 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.940
 if you want something I do it since 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.240
 we have reached one hundred members and they are 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.979
 really really happy so I close 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.919
 this video to say thanks to everyone 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.460
