 up for the preparation of the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.580
 oven you need to leave 15 minutes the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.150
 piston with a fire to the maximum so it 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.760
 they heat approximately 160 degrees 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.220
 centigrade then let it rest 10 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.800
 minutes and then the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.410
 first batch of baked bread that lasts 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.420
 approximately 10 minutes this first 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.820
 Batch consists of the largest loaves 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.830

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.080
 empanadas in the second round it 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.720
 introduce the smallest breads as 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.510
 They are bread with cream cheese with cajeta and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.150
 with chocolate and these are left baking 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.430
 approximately 10 minutes this is due 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.380
 that the oven is cooling down and if 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.480
 introduce the smallest breads in the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.580
 first batch could be at risk 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.250
 that the filling burns 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.080
 the ovens are made of concrete and form 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.080
 oval to keep the heat 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.370
 of bread selection is carried out 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.680
 to remove the losses the losses are 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.470
 breads that were not formed correctly or 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.140
 they do not look attractive to the public but nothing 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.599
 this type of bread is wasted optan 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.090
 for giving it away after the bread is 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.550
 completely clean and without any shrinkage 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.010
 we proceed to accommodate them in their 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.440
 respective trays so that they look like 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.049
