I bet he really regrets he's bringing a
rain<00:01:45.869> team<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.350> i<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.890> kills<00:01:47.159> like

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
rain team because i think it kills like

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
rain team because i think it kills like
three<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.820> poking<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.240> two<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.509> three<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
three was poking with two or three of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.170 
three was poking with two or three of
his<00:01:48.810> pokemon<00:01:49.290> i<00:01:49.500> actually<00:01:50.220> died<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
his pokemon i actually died because of a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.149 
his pokemon i actually died because of a
hail<00:01:51.450> which<00:01:51.720> i<00:01:51.869> thought<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.259> funny<00:01:52.500> because

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
hail which i thought was funny because

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
hail which i thought was funny because
it<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.430> pretty<00:01:53.640> much<00:01:53.820> working<00:01:54.119> against<00:01:54.630> him

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it was pretty much working against him

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.590 
it was pretty much working against him
in<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.200> sense<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> i<00:01:57.180> don't<00:01:57.450> actually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
in that sense and so i don't actually

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.209 
in that sense and so i don't actually
get<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> bring<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.350> politoed<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.070> this

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
get to bring out my politoed at this

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
get to bring out my politoed at this
entire<00:01:59.610> battle<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> rain<00:02:00.689> team

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
entire battle so i have a rain team

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530 
entire battle so i have a rain team
that's<00:02:01.530> killing<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.460> hit<00:02:02.759> into<00:02:03.060> hill<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that's killing it in a hit into hill so

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
that's killing it in a hit into hill so
i<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:04.110> i<00:02:04.409> thought<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.520> entertaining

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
i just i thought that was entertaining

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.359 
i just i thought that was entertaining
I'm<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.990> good<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.229> building<00:02:07.500> weather<00:02:07.770> team<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
I'm not good at building weather team so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.749 
I'm not good at building weather team so
it<00:02:08.520> probably<00:02:08.819> isn't<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> most<00:02:09.360> Balan

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
it probably isn't the most Balan

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.789 
it probably isn't the most Balan
