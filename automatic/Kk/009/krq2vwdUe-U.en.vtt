00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.589
 had to do 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.859
 we agreed to go to the kitchen table to sort things out 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.400
 a 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.189
 I want to fall back 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.399
 but this first time explaining a little about how Antwerp is about what it is about 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.380
 but first of all I want to ask how it talks to you now what do you have one 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.769
 experienced a lot lately 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.949
 but well now 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.560
 well then you know the time 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.650
 soccer bottom 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.040
 give up with jumped out of a window yes 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.470
 This means that the actress has to be with your leg 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.900
 well that goes out well 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 use them all well again 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.880
 Oct 31st it could have looked different but got it 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.410
 how they prevent your children there 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.480
 jumped out of the windows 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.850
 yes that is of course possible I hope 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.550
 I have had a conflict training at work yes actually the past 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.670
 fall my boss point to visit to take all the questions 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.630
 He talks about it then last year the number of things happened are the headlines 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.000
 running company runs according to him so did not go well that worked well 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.590
 the current conflict 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.500
 then I thought he would come back to the sun and visit me 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.530
 I looked out the window personally way Beijing 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350
 the tram stop is yes 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.960
 and that looked up and I have heavy rain every moment 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.400
 this and for the day telephoning 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.020
 he thought he would remind me to make shiites he calls people 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 to 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.870
 get hold of yes 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.310
 then be neat to get the belgian attention but it is out 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.260
 the municipality 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.409
 that fear in honda 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.810
 what did you think at the time not properly 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.610
 there is the number that can be read in one go at the door 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.010
 the formation comes out when we could finish well 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.310
 if you could take a little traffic, he would jump out of the window 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.329
 we panicked and panicked 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.209
 he lived sunday book life trying to go cissÃ© 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.909
 but want to talk about anything with a club because 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.909
 sometimes it acted very well in a panic 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.660
 and imagine that those people were already thinking stengun banners and with that can 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.659
 break your leg but see lahm get bought 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.129
 but still very often so that people acted in panic and there the actual 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.799
 problem much bigger 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.120
 and I want to nail Jan and not only about this incident but also all that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.489
 other incidents 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.009
 a coffee cup 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.039
 what exactly happened and how you got there in the future 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.789
 all the more so 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.139
 so you better use your safety if you panic less often 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.729
 and more importantly it seems that the city is how you feel and there what you do 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.799
 that there is often a consequence of it 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.889
 how you think in a certain situation 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.630
 because then it just did not tell me in whom it is still taken 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.630
 that is making the comic note 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.089
 Rakia's panic broke out when the addressed 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.649
 because what would have happened if you had thought this morning 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.379
 that is never again 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.079
 there now applies thanks to becoming a gloriant-driven organizer 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.029
 After the man on the side source 9 The Netherlands and other Western European countries 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.739
 participate yes 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.369
 it is an example of this 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:35.720
 the more played for responding to 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.359
 on the road 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.939
 in the same event the events belga adv 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.030
 depending on how you do things wrong now the danger in school 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.649
 so do you otherwise the call is made 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.919
 and I want to check with you on aldi events that happened 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.369
 how the women 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.549
 before looking at him 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.650
 because the 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.760
 I know that he has happened out of things while knowing for sure how 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.839
 each other 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.039
 but a balcony that tells me that he sometimes loses it very much 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.319
 jumped in the meantime 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.159
 the room 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.749
 Yes 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.169
 and the idea then is that 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.869
 my heart better to figure out that thought 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.349
 man well 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.529
 we get 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.719
 Another thing is that he then switched to an active role of years 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.310
 arrested 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.310
 what I work for is that as people 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 winter with a number of things 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.120
 that they hope that someone else can solve that for them 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.129
 and that is very bad 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.089
 and of course if you go to a doctor also comes a few 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.089
 painful truth had told that the stomachache architect after that sets another one 

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.850
 few questions 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.469
 that is 15 September 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.270
 then it goes better with your stomach 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.349
 These calls should you not want before September 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.060
 I will certainly do my best not help but there must also be a whole 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.210
 play an active role 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.620
 Because he knew that you could think about the situation yourself too 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.990
 check on other thoughts which makes you behave differently about situations 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.020
 can think 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.419
 and for what maybe 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.599
 in the future 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.129
 if we win 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.879
 happened on when there are people around you hours don't know exactly what they think of you 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.889
 want 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 and no longer in that situation does it panic does not touch 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.789
 a man on site manages 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.830
 incomprehensible 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.830
 that also means that that point is less 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.620
 in the earlier 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.400
 I have to fill in forms during the interview 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.250
 but also getting it home again and again afterwards, there is still room for it 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.139
 stand out more if you like the music 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.129
 you are prepared to arrange this yourself via the media and take it back 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.500
 and that year 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.559
 we speak here 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.559
 as most of them formulated are listed here in this book 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.419
 if we work in a very structured way 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.419
 this is a manual for me 6 which steps are the most 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.669
 conversation 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.669
 and this is the book for you yes a workbook 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:08.400
 and we have together 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.060
 a summary of the conversation revelation 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.260
 but also a number of exercises and a large number of the forms that we have 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.849
 will use 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.559
 I would explain it to you 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:19.289
 and what the intention is 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.580
 It is important that you keep the book well and take it with you every time 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.229
 for the next conversation 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.879
 really structured 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.289
 in the sense that we can make every time 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.270
 yes and not on the agenda debit positions you think are important to 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.270
 discuss and the discounts that it is important and discuss 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.259
 came back later to give conversation 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:46.099
 and whether things are annoying 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.029
 we can still talk about things that you 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:52.419
 the concluding party in the last week would have three other suspects 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:56.389
 on an understandable yes 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.499
 the idea is that he too see it weekly 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:00.869
 three quarters 

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.149
 can always finish with 

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:06.699
 It will depend on people finding that it takes too long a day 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.199
 can't get on very well 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.639
 concentrate so well 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.490
 if so then just for the top layer of 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.869
 I make shorter appointments and 20 minutes 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.680
 and maybe do it twice a week 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.389
 I think that's just like that 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:24.220
 Some points in each other can talk that all together three or four 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:25.889
 men 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.749
 others 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:30.020
 it worked 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.129
 Perry with saying what about now agreed what he still is 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:37.909
 so very much what have you told that now 

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:42.729
 nÃ¼rnberg 9 conversations with each other via romney will take approximately 45 minutes 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:47.059
 take how we will get ourselves to that too long in short 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.700
 the actual and da ok sure to discuss the watch well 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.320
 he denies and then we will make an inventory of what is good or bad if 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:02.300
 you can ask anywhere for the euro after the criticism has to be believed 

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:07.799
 yes and why us about a million shares are in their twenties sessions 

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:12.029
 You must also remember everything 

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:14.439
 I think that will sometimes be tested 

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:15.359
 good use at the moment
