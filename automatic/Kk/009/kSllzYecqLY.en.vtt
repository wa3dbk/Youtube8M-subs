00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
ammunition so which means we can do this

that's inside the cartridge so it's the

really<00:02:36.600> fast<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.230> heard<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.680> were<00:02:37.800> talking<00:02:38.280> to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
really fast I heard you were talking to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.860 
really fast I heard you were talking to
your<00:02:38.550> students<00:02:39.090> today<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
your students today and one of the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.650 
your students today and one of the
things<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.320> you'd<00:02:40.590> mentioned<00:02:41.160> was<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:42.420> wear

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
things that you'd mentioned was you wear

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.500 
things that you'd mentioned was you wear
earplugs<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.070> zone<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.880> I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
earplugs so that you can zone out and I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.210 
earplugs so that you can zone out and I
really<00:02:45.810> thought<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.200> was<00:02:46.410> good<00:02:46.680> because<00:02:46.860> in

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
really thought that was good because in

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.310 
really thought that was good because in
any<00:02:47.430> riding<00:02:47.790> discipline<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.870> good<00:02:49.080> tip

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
any riding discipline that's a good tip

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.560 
any riding discipline that's a good tip
I<00:02:49.680> think<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:51.209> know<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.390> any

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
I think it is you know in any

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.720 
I think it is you know in any
competition<00:02:52.070> whether<00:02:53.070> you're<00:02:53.340> writing

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
competition whether you're writing

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.690 
competition whether you're writing
shooting<00:02:54.530> playing<00:02:55.530> basketball<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.550> know<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
shooting playing basketball you know to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
shooting playing basketball you know to
be<00:02:56.970> able<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.300> stay<00:02:57.690> focused<00:02:57.989> through<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> end

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
be able to stay focused through the end

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.729 
be able to stay focused through the end
is<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> big<00:02:59.880> part<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.239> competition<00:03:00.840> once<00:03:01.560> you've

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
is a big part of competition once you've

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.560 
is a big part of competition once you've
got<00:03:01.890> your<00:03:01.920> mechanics<00:03:02.519> down<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.090> riding<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
got your mechanics down the riding and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.470 
got your mechanics down the riding and
shooting<00:03:03.709> then<00:03:04.709> creeps<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.880> mental<00:03:06.269> side

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
shooting then creeps in the mental side

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
shooting then creeps in the mental side
of<00:03:06.739> competition<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.400> stay<00:03:08.640> focused

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
of competition and to stay focused

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.970 
of competition and to stay focused
through<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.480> end<00:03:09.720> becomes<00:03:10.680> quite<00:03:10.950> a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
through the end becomes quite a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.100 
through the end becomes quite a
challenge<00:03:11.459> for<00:03:11.730> most<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.810> human

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
challenge for most just it's human

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.380 
challenge for most just it's human
nature<00:03:13.140> for<00:03:13.680> us<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.160> start<00:03:14.400> having<00:03:14.459> doubts<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
nature for us to start having doubts and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.229 
nature for us to start having doubts and
letting<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.200> adrenaline<00:03:16.709> take<00:03:16.950> over<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.550> you

starting slow and small so you know the

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.459 
starting slow and small so you know the
worst<00:04:00.060> thing<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.359> possibly<00:04:00.569> do<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.079> just<00:04:01.290> get

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
worst thing you possibly do is just get

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.929 
worst thing you possibly do is just get

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
half load or something like that to

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.099 
half load or something like that to
start<00:04:16.799> out<00:04:16.949> really<00:04:17.160> slow<00:04:17.549> take<00:04:18.299> your<00:04:18.329> time<00:04:18.720> so

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
start out really slow take your time so

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.749 
start out really slow take your time so
that<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.380> horse<00:04:19.590> learns<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:20.009> understand<00:04:20.549> it

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
that the horse learns to understand it

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.310 
that the horse learns to understand it
and<00:04:20.910> once<00:04:21.090> they<00:04:21.269> build<00:04:21.479> confidence<00:04:21.720> in<00:04:22.199> it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
and once they build confidence in it

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.879 
and once they build confidence in it
then<00:04:22.530> they<00:04:23.400> know<00:04:23.550> away<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.940> go<00:04:24.500> well<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.620> can't
