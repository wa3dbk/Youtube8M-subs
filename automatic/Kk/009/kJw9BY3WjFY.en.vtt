00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.330
 the cemetery of trento at the mercy of 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.550
 rabbits so as to report it are i 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.760
 citizens who 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.130
 no they have risen from the reds of the Adige and 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.290
 they live undisturbed among the tombs 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.689
 they dug ton and nest yes 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.790
 chase and play among the gravestones yes 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.660
 they feed on flower plants placed on 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.270
 graves 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.849
 what the latter is no longer tolerated by 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.500
 family members and that is a cause for continuous and 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.120
 heated protests 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.829
 many are being reported 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.530
 to the funeral office and even to 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.600
 mayor but nothing has been done yet 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.000
 not that of attributing to animalists e 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.370
 environmentalists the responsibility of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.230
 no answers what 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.120
 simply people ask 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.429
 return to the cemetery on the meaning 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.199
 of sacredness with action capable of 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.260
 interpret the sensitivity of those 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.820
 in pain they invoke respect and not yes 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.329
 resign the idea that this place 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.120
 become a rabbit farm 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.710
 let's listen to the lady citizens 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.420
 giuliana what's going on here at 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.820
 cemetery is a month that expresses husband is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.750
 the third time he changed the cup of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.340
 flowers 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.530
 I come down in the morning I find them all 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.040
 eaten by some of the kennels 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.190
 here I would like to ask if anyone can 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.750
 can help us here is also why this 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.150
 costs you money 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 in short, quite anomalous in that 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.040
 forward cured and see how you are 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.250
 before a deceased because he is always mine 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.160
 husband is always a person of ours 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.190
 family and everything and see that but not 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.530
 I have no husband with animals, though 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.510
 prizes of the ma lady tell us the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.700
 discomfort you are experiencing 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.560
 practically every morning siemens si 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.090
 find everything the flowers force the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.370
 grave to all and ruined that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.870
 you have to change them and issue them another 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.730
 turn to door nolana right stuff 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.710
 they should go down because in 40 years 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.170
 nothing happened and tomorrow it a 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.270
 disaster here is the only stuff I have to say 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.519
 that also the people who are near them and that 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.680
 eat all your fingers because they are 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.170
 able and that sees everything how much to have 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.030
 ruined but yes yes yes yes but not the fan 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.970
 net pulp interior but nobody talks about it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.220
 because he knows where he was born to me who put in 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.930
 place a little managerial for charity 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.580
 beasts cross and with mold damage 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 however, I will speak on the other hand 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.240
 a little bit of dead of the decoration of the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.860
 order requirements for their white kila 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.010
 she's every time she has to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.550
 change the left period flowers here one 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.460
 day sin is practically as I am 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.810
 the violets that you have to say if you are small 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.870
 every day touched me changing a 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.310
 day by day days now as they are 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.450
 of succulent plants now as among the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.670
 its fake flowers because it's impossible 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.920
 launching the other day finds an example 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.020
 all the chrysanthemums bore all of the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.030
 seedlings for we understood in large with 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.100
 discomfort for charity play willingly and 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.950
 I don't say mica no no but it's not stuff 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.590
 nice lady what's going on here at 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.750
 cemetery and I think there were now 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 also some newspaper articles all 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.020
 by now they know there is an invasion of 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.740
 rabbits obviously rabbits yes 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.360
 they proliferate exceptionally and 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.730
 they dig around the graves eat 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.280
 flowers 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.870
 and therefore they ruin everything a lot 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.940
 people then take the scares for 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.080
 that suddenly appear 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 a little common sense would be enough for 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.730
 solve the problem that is capture them and 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.260
 bring them back or where they were before right 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.360
 mind on the roses of the Adige create 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.129
 but there will be some problems with potholes 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.790
 place where you can bring them and what not 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.370
 disturb 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.970
 for how long and what you've noticed 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.860
 this problem but certainly a year 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.480
 it will be a year that there are these rabbits 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.340
 that I realized not rabbits 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.870
 there are even certain graves that 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.049
 admit lattice around the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.340
 plants, however, do not seem logical 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.720
 it would just take common sense for 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.340
 solve a problem that would otherwise be 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.940
 it magnifies more and more until later 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.359
 explodes 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.129
 so what do you ask Mr. Mayor? 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.319
 take action with common sense 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.480
 because a common sense solution must 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.660
 being there we cannot be at the mercy of 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.060
 rabbits to stem this problem 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.609
 we should intervene in rapid times 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.430
 since the discomfort of the users of the 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.500
 cemetery is becoming unsustainable 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.419
 it is not asked to shoot them down but to 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.820
 move them to suitable places 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.110
 thus restoring dignity to this place 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.389
 sacred 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.510
 the rabbits at the cemetery more and more a 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.060
 problem if very very big because 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.979
 They are eating everything they are doing 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.090
 holes under the graves that is really a 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.250
 disaster 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.430
 and when the customer arrives he asks what 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.169
 don't eat it once and change them 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.150
 flowers twice change the words 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.889
 they change more than they are eating everything 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.889
 even the flowers in the vases
