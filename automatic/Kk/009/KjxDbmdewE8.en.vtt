00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
like ghosts in the night here we are to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.460 
like ghosts in the night here we are to
review<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.319> specter<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.130> was<00:00:05.970> good<00:00:06.470> to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
review the specter that was good to

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.140 
review the specter that was good to
specters<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.069> we<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:10.620> original<00:00:11.219> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
specters here we have the original and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150 
specters here we have the original and
the<00:00:12.179> late<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> we're<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.920> talk<00:00:14.040> about

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the late so we're going to talk about

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.150 
the late so we're going to talk about
how<00:00:14.429> they<00:00:15.000> are<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.990> same<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.560> different<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
how they are the same and different and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.660 
how they are the same and different and
what<00:00:17.880> makes<00:00:18.529> them<00:00:20.359> special<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> first<00:00:26.430> things

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
what makes them special so first things

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.310 
what makes them special so first things
first<00:00:26.930> if<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.080> may<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:29.869> one<00:00:30.869> noticeable

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
first if I may go what one noticeable

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
first if I may go what one noticeable
thing<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:32.030> that<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.620> actual<00:00:35.190> body<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.850> blaster

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
thing is that the actual body of blaster

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.770 
thing is that the actual body of blaster
is<00:00:36.600> quite<00:00:36.840> different<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.340> elite<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is quite different on the elite one the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
is quite different on the elite one the
turret<00:00:40.170> doesn't<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> air<00:00:41.250> restrictors

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
turret doesn't have the air restrictors

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
turret doesn't have the air restrictors
the<00:00:42.059> air<00:00:42.149> restrictor<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.660> integrated<00:00:43.200> into

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the air restrictor is integrated into

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.910 
the air restrictor is integrated into
the<00:00:44.100> actual<00:00:44.370> mechanism<00:00:44.940> inside<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:46.649> elite

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the actual mechanism inside on the elite

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.119 
the actual mechanism inside on the elite
or<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> end<00:00:47.670> strike<00:00:48.030> version<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.129> error

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
or the end strike version the error

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.709 
or the end strike version the error
structures<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> turret<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.570> why

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
structures are in the turret that's why

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.490 
structures are in the turret that's why
the<00:00:51.780> turret<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> bigger<00:00:53.480> than<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
the turret is bigger than the other and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
the turret is bigger than the other and
that's<00:00:58.500> also<00:00:58.859> why<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.460> elite<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.270> has<00:01:00.510> larger

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that's also why the elite one has larger

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
that's also why the elite one has larger
body<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.039> turret<00:01:02.239> because<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
body in back of the turret because it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.850 
body in back of the turret because it
has<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> elite<00:01:04.850> power<00:01:05.850> inside<00:01:06.590> they<00:01:07.590> had<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
has that elite power inside they had to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
has that elite power inside they had to
change<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.430> move<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> turret<00:01:09.450> forward<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
change it up move the turret forward a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
change it up move the turret forward a
little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.640> could

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
little bit and you know so they could

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.740 
little bit and you know so they could
have<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> same<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.810> same<00:01:15.840> style<00:01:16.619> without

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
have the same the same style without

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.149 
have the same the same style without
let's<00:01:18.750> say<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:18.990> change<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.979> too<00:01:20.100> much

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
let's say I don't change it up too much

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.820 
let's say I don't change it up too much
we've<00:01:20.759> been<00:01:20.909> discussing<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.380> possible

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
we've been discussing the the possible

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
we've been discussing the the possible
benefits<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.580> differences<00:01:24.570> between<00:01:24.780> having

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
benefits and differences between having

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.550 
benefits and differences between having
it<00:01:26.119> internal<00:01:27.119> versus<00:01:27.420> external<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.170> we

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it internal versus external and we

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.859 
it internal versus external and we
believe<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.340> probably<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:30.390> linked

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
believe that it's probably more linked

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.200 
believe that it's probably more linked
or<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.250> probably<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.880> any<00:01:33.060> more

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
or you will probably get any more

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
or you will probably get any more
consistent<00:01:33.960> rate<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> fire<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:34.770> consistent

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
consistent rate of fire more consistent

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
consistent rate of fire more consistent

the<00:01:40.250> original<00:01:40.670> Spectre<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:43.270> color<00:01:44.270> change

the original Spectre the color change
between<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.470> two<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:46.240> significant<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.360> this

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
between the two is significant and this

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.820 
between the two is significant and this
is<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.140> bit<00:01:48.350> more<00:01:48.620> pleasing<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.310> me<00:01:49.970> anyway<00:01:50.830> the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
is a bit more pleasing to me anyway the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.250 
is a bit more pleasing to me anyway the
accessory<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.820> exactly<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.660> same<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.050> mold

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
accessory is exactly the same and mold

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.310 
accessory is exactly the same and mold
it<00:01:54.530> sing<00:01:55.400> again<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.030> color<00:01:56.240> change<00:01:56.540> I

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
it sing again just a color change I

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.499 
it sing again just a color change I
really<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:58.520> barrel<00:01:58.850> extension<00:01:59.060> it's

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
really like this barrel extension it's

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.550 
really like this barrel extension it's
very<00:02:00.009> realistic<00:02:01.060> looking<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.330> little<00:02:02.780> bit<00:02:02.990> out

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
very realistic looking a little bit out

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.070 
very realistic looking a little bit out
of<00:02:03.590> proportion<00:02:03.800> but<00:02:04.430> well<00:02:05.000> there<00:02:05.630> are<00:02:05.780> quite<00:02:06.020> a

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
of proportion but well there are quite a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.350 
of proportion but well there are quite a
few<00:02:06.170> suppressors<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.070> do<00:02:07.280> wind<00:02:07.940> up<00:02:08.090> coming

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
few suppressors that do wind up coming

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.270 
few suppressors that do wind up coming
up<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:09.020> about<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.470> size<00:02:09.709> i<00:02:09.979> think<00:02:10.160> they're

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
up to about this size i think they're

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.920 
up to about this size i think they're
called<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:10.670> soda<00:02:10.970> cans<00:02:11.270> suppressors<00:02:11.780> or

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
called like soda cans suppressors or

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.479 
called like soda cans suppressors or
something<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.160> isn't<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
something like that but this isn't the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.320 
something like that but this isn't the
soda<00:02:13.730> can<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:14.750> an<00:02:14.870> earth<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:18.380> anyway

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
soda can this is an earth but anyway

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.280 
soda can this is an earth but anyway
just<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.660> buttstock<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.190> same<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:23.290> don't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
just the buttstock is the same I don't

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.590 
just the buttstock is the same I don't
really<00:02:24.709> like<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.550> didn't<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.209> with

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
really like it I didn't like it with

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360 
really like it I didn't like it with
this<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:27.200> hoping<00:02:27.590> for<00:02:27.650> something<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.340> little

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
this I was hoping for something a little

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.050 
this I was hoping for something a little
bit<00:02:28.760> different<00:02:29.150> with<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.390> original<00:02:29.600> spectrum

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
bit different with the original spectrum

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.470 
bit different with the original spectrum
it<00:02:32.060> suffers<00:02:32.600> from<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.870> same<00:02:33.040> bit<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
it suffers from the same bit as the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.330 
it suffers from the same bit as the
Recon<00:02:36.070> stock<00:02:37.959> flimsy<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> idea<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
Recon stock flimsy I like the idea of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.590 
Recon stock flimsy I like the idea of
being<00:02:40.640> able<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.530> collapse<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.100> whatever

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
being able to collapse it in whatever

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.330 
being able to collapse it in whatever
but<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:45.350> there's<00:02:45.560> not<00:02:45.830> enough

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
but it's just there's not enough

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.150 
but it's just there's not enough
strength<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.840> here<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.769> support

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
strength in this here to support

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.449 
strength in this here to support
aggressive<00:02:50.030> thing<00:02:50.769> yep<00:02:53.560> see<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.590> mean<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
aggressive thing yep see I mean the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.900 
aggressive thing yep see I mean the
difference<00:02:55.880> really<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:57.310> quite<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.670> know<00:03:01.700> it's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
difference really is quite you know it's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.270 
difference really is quite you know it's
not<00:03:02.060> much<00:03:02.299> basically<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:03.380> know<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> mean<00:03:03.739> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
not much basically you know I mean the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.910 
not much basically you know I mean the
body<00:03:05.030> blasters<00:03:05.630> change<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.140> little<00:03:06.260> bit<00:03:06.380> but

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
body blasters change a little bit but

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.220 
body blasters change a little bit but
overall<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.910> basically<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.420> same<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:09.200> same

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
overall it's basically the same the same

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.800 
overall it's basically the same the same
blaster<00:03:09.860> other<00:03:10.459> than<00:03:10.760> performance<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.750> was

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
blaster other than performance it was

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.120 
blaster other than performance it was
updated<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.380> little<00:03:12.410> bit<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.820> get<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:15.140> better

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
updated a little bit to get you a better

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.759 
updated a little bit to get you a better
more<00:03:16.519> consistent<00:03:17.000> rate<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.269> fire<00:03:17.769> again

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
more consistent rate of fire again

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.310 
more consistent rate of fire again
theoretically<00:03:19.400> other<00:03:20.360> than<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.630> it's<00:03:21.260> just

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
theoretically other than that it's just

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.979 
theoretically other than that it's just
able<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.739> regular<00:03:22.040> Spector<00:03:22.400> one<00:03:23.329> thing<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.630> note

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
able a regular Spector one thing to note

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.210 
able a regular Spector one thing to note
though<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:25.000> one<00:03:26.000> thing<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.329> note<00:03:26.920> we<00:03:27.920> figured

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
though it one thing to note we figured

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.180 
though it one thing to note we figured
this<00:03:28.370> out<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.730> hard<00:03:28.760> way<00:03:29.000> yes<00:03:29.510> we<00:03:29.870> do<00:03:30.170> not<00:03:30.470> slam

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
this out the hard way yes we do not slam

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.470 
this out the hard way yes we do not slam
fire<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.540> spectre<00:03:33.519> we<00:03:34.519> broke<00:03:34.790> one<00:03:35.090> doing<00:03:35.450> that

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
fire the spectre we broke one doing that

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.680 
fire the spectre we broke one doing that
figuring<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:36.650> maybe<00:03:37.549> since<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.120> has<00:03:38.269> a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
figuring you know maybe since it has a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.630 
figuring you know maybe since it has a
similar<00:03:39.110> mechanism<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.890> strong<00:03:40.190> arm<00:03:40.400> that

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
similar mechanism to the strong arm that

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.130 
similar mechanism to the strong arm that
it<00:03:41.329> would<00:03:41.540> be<00:03:41.690> able<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.989> slam<00:03:42.230> fire<00:03:42.530> but<00:03:43.430> no

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
it would be able to slam fire but no

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.140 
it would be able to slam fire but no
another<00:03:45.140> one<00:03:45.260> bites<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.799> dust<00:03:45.890> yes<00:03:46.640> but<00:03:47.060> at

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
another one bites the dust yes but at

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150 
another one bites the dust yes but at
least<00:03:47.269> but<00:03:47.870> at<00:03:47.900> least<00:03:48.079> I<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.699> excel

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
least but at least I got to excel

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.100 
least but at least I got to excel
cerise<00:03:50.400> out<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> gay<00:03:52.400> essence<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.700> like<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
cerise out of it gay essence I like the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.910 
cerise out of it gay essence I like the
suppressor<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.240> Iraq<00:03:57.240> expect<00:03:57.570> as<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:58.380> saw<00:03:58.620> in

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
suppressor on Iraq expect as we saw in

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.890 
suppressor on Iraq expect as we saw in
the<00:03:58.950> rapid<00:03:59.400> strike<00:03:59.610> episode<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.450> looks<00:04:00.690> pretty

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
the rapid strike episode it looks pretty

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.300 
the rapid strike episode it looks pretty
sharp<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.500> looks<00:04:01.680> pretty<00:04:01.860> sharp<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.160> looks

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
sharp it looks pretty sharp it looks

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.160 
sharp it looks pretty sharp it looks
good<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.600> probably<00:04:03.840> one<00:04:04.140> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
good I like it this is probably one of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.870 
good I like it this is probably one of
the<00:04:04.380> better<00:04:04.560> barrel<00:04:05.010> extensions<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:05.640> we've

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
the better barrel extensions that we've

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.200 
the better barrel extensions that we've
seen<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.430> second<00:04:08.760> barrel<00:04:09.000> extension

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
seen so it's the second barrel extension

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.300 
seen so it's the second barrel extension
in<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:10.490> league<00:04:11.490> line<00:04:11.670> yes<00:04:13.310> limited

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
in the league line yes limited

accessories so far for the Ely line but

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.370 
accessories so far for the Ely line but
you<00:04:16.980> know<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.670> what<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.360> think<00:04:19.320> I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
you know it is what it is I think I

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.560 
you know it is what it is I think I
don't<00:04:22.380> think<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.620> looks<00:04:22.740> too<00:04:22.950> badly<00:04:23.570> stripped

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
don't think it looks too badly stripped

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:34.880 
don't think it looks too badly stripped

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
know what I think is a good friend to

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.250 
know what I think is a good friend to
the<00:04:36.900> spectre<00:04:37.320> well<00:04:37.680> what<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.980> that<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
the spectre well what is that the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.020 
the spectre well what is that the
10-round<00:04:41.240> stock<00:04:42.240> from<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.850> stockade<00:04:44.850> you

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
10-round stock from the stockade you

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.590 
10-round stock from the stockade you
know<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:46.410> is<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.800> fantastic<00:04:47.600> fantastic

know and that is a fantastic fantastic

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.970 
know and that is a fantastic fantastic
don't<00:04:49.350> because<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:51.120> spectre<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:52.170> five-shot

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
don't because the spectre is a five-shot

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.450 
don't because the spectre is a five-shot
