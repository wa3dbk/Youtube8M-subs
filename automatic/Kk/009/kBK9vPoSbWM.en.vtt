so insert the bulb and twist going to be

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.820 
so insert the bulb and twist going to be
a<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:28.890> bit<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.250> pain<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.840> twist<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.560> put

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
place

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.020 
place
change<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> angle<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.820> see

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
change the angle here so you can see

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.100 
change the angle here so you can see
from<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> top<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:41.390> make<00:02:42.390> sure<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.690> goes<00:02:42.900> in

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
from the top and make sure that goes in

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.050 
from the top and make sure that goes in
correctly<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.870> push<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.020> other<00:02:46.050> side<00:02:46.410> and
