00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.250
 this video contents the fifth day of play 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.529
 or the review to me 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 will keep the whole short and crisp 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.349
 cry the final matches long ago 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.750
 he ran that easily 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.250
 organizational reasons and we will 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.640
 let's see who ever 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.170
 The final draft is good and at the beginning 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.760
 I have to say this review immediately 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.500
 that you do not see two encounters 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 because such recorder because unfortunately 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 not working properly that means 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 without models and in world we will 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 Unfortunately not in the world that is completely 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 just continue like the encounter 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 between in cotta gaming and the black 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 night more there is black night more without 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.309
 problems have come on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 Let's first look at the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.540
 meeting between Rio and the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 hysterical team I have to say that is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.660
 beautiful because these two teams 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.030
 to watch because they are very very 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.190
 were balanced or the kills though 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.890
 even in form, they were just worthy 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 the core, however, were the teams there 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.239
 walkerin reinforced with everything 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 the oldie from 0 0 again a core figure 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.199
 because the team crew tendencies could 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 but it was also possible to recognize 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.439
 to position yourself well again and again 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 uncertainties with his oldie too 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.100
 defend because distance quite simply 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 are super annoying a slight advantage of a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.479
 or other larger veit again and again 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.220
 the hysterical team and thus could 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.200
 you more coal and accordingly too 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.790
 to collect more items, too, it was the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.680
 historian team always succeeded 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.509
 to make the dragon or this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.369
 Needed as you can see here too good 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 Defend that means it originated 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.900
 again and again smaller fights where indeed 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.450
 not all team members of lira 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.250
 turned off, however, it was too harsh 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.280
 losses came naturally 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.470
 noticeable later in the game and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 Thus, the hysterical team could do one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.979
 was after the other thing above all things 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.020
 win gates by good 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.970
 league has tried with all power 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.770
 but this is Mr. kickin 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 also made from time to time the bears 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.430
 and thus a further advantage 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.960
 Finally, it finally happened 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.939
 a bigger team falls in the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.520
 baseball the hysterical team in the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.130
 Lage was wet for the first time 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.110
 So unfortunately teamleader got kicked out 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.790
 and therefore no chance on 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.649
 a placement on the third or 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.689
 you still have fourth place 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.539
 the performance of this team in any case 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.310
 reward because they are quite simple 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.459
 come very far in this tournament 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.459
 are 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.500
 well the next pores encounter sets 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 made up of cryptex against the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.820
 fivers legends this was also one 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.680
 Preliminary match that means here 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.990
 flown out has no chance anymore 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.730
 For a profit from the kills he has to 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.680
 They say that the fivers are legends 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 could definitely keep up with cryptex 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.040
 the model of the distance was not there 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.930
 too big if you have one 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.130
 A detailed look at the money raises 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.380
 you will notice that cryptex 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.630
 is driven much better and 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.310
 thus also a more effective items 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.250
 came as it then to larger 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.360
 Teams came have tried last fit 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.810
 to hear against but a well placed 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.960
 leona and ing the fight and julio has 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.760
 decided on the sinti 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.530
 Of course, you can miss this combo 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.150
 be dangerous but you are not 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.940
 more capable of yourself or the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.010
 edi carey to protect and thus witex in 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.960
 the situation this fight without problems too 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.150
 win a few moments later came 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.770
 it then to a drive of cryptex where 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.990
 they are also excellent 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.550
 team celebrating performance provided which have 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.740
 you have to say that the gold and at 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.780
 the distance meanwhile quite big 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.730
 was and thus a successful ingate 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.260
 no problem represents the last five 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.760
 Legends have thus emerged from the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.800
 tournament also adopted 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.850
 a beautiful achievement rendered 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.850
 they made it this far 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.890
 so after this game just had to 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.629
 be determined who in the big and 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.159
 would be the little final draw 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.319
 that means in the upcoming game 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.990
 loses is not out but plays 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.690
 only at third place 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.270
 that means the first encounter is the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.890
 black night have been more against cryptex 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.160
 and here I have to say that it already 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.500
 was almost a one-man show by danny 89 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.690
 who started here as a comforting fade 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.910
 it is almost already special korea 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.340
 compels this champion in the rank to track 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.710
 because he just way too strong it 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.350
 at least according to the view of the koreans 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.210
 that means danny from team cryptex 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.180
 Able to complete this champion 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.250
 to exhaust and thus a kill after 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.530
 you have to generate the other one here 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.120
 also say that, of course 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.280
 comforting is a pretty tough one 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.290
 Counter opponent Kali is therefore only 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.140
 his multi must activate and they 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.970
 Thus, even in her cloud sees this 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.830
 in many situations to the goal 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.840
 and twisted missing was able too 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.970
 the other country to support the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.040
 also mastered brilliantly 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.410
 So Cryptex was able to do that 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.210
 bigger teams to decide for themselves 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.980
 by simply brushing with 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.500
 twisted field was enormously high 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.740
 kelly has then later against 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.760
 he can count on standard batzen money 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.720
 but was received as well 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.700
 switched off 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.230
 After this little maneuver many became 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.300
 Members of the black night more 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.850
 switched off and thus lay the nexus 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.310
 more or less free and then became 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.080
 with towers torn thus stood now 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.880
 fixed that cryptex in the big finale 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.530
 moves in and the black night more 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.740
 forced to move to third place 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.740
 play 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.600
 good and on the other side of the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.760
 tournament found the last game of the 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.040
 fifth play day and that is the 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.810
 hysterical team go in the world here 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.310
 was very happy about that 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.350
 this encounter is essential 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.720
 was balanced then was then the 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.130
 focus again on the successful team 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.590
 if because the response time is natural 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.690
 the longer the game goes into enormous 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.520
 heights and thus one has none 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.990
 chance for a failed team 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.150
 if his base still defend 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.040
 So during the first part, that has 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.500
 is he decided he is kalisch 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.330
 hard to focus on and u became multi 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.520
 just worked on them but there 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.650
 nevertheless able to comparatively much 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.180
 to express damage while saying 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.000
 that it's also the fighter again 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.340
 blues poverty felt half a fight 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.260
 hour against jacques and tag being 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.330
 they just do not kill each other 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.430
 Orad could still try from the outside 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.470
 help but the teams agree 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.180
 a three to three shortly after this 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.610
 There were also smaller ones 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.260
 fight where they will be attempted the pace 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.790
 to enter the aesthetic team 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.710
 However, this team was able to 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.540
 successfully defend against and in 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.700
 the world has to kill one or the other 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.560
 give up and thus the game has 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.240
 something calms that means you have one 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.370
 pretty long time after a good one 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.170
 possibility of a new enemy 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.000
 but both were really 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.770
 very restrained and really only wanted 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.510
 then in gaydon if it makes sense for them 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.820
 finally has in world 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.890
 considering near your own base 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.780
 a charge to dust one must however 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.060
 here say that only a beautiful 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.370
 multiplied if much damage inflict 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.800
 could and she has long turned off 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.900
 and simply do not know died 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.420
 that is, he could well can the opponents 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.700
 deliberate and deal a lot of damage 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.920
 and so is the team for that 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.410
 hysterical team are doing well 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.300
 after that was done another 1000 one 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.910
 editor torn and finally 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.100
 the nexus ge focus that has led to it 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.260
 that the hysterical team in the big one 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.010
 finales and in world for the third 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.320
 Space plays so now we know who 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.240
 large and moved into the small final 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.800
 is from organizational and are the 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.540
 already played the game 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.400
 means you can here on the left on it 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.370
 click the individual finale 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.620
 many to look at and i hope so 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.850
 is the entertaining streamer for you 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.250
 unfortunately not working there anyway
