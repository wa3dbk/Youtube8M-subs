keeps you at the distance of his punch
you<00:02:02.270> know<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.690> that's<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.830> key<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:05.080> and

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
you know and that's just a key of it and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.020 
you know and that's just a key of it and
everybody<00:02:06.530> thinks<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.920> newfound<00:02:07.430> power<00:02:07.729> of

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
everybody thinks the newfound power of

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.990 
everybody thinks the newfound power of
Marquez<00:02:08.649> would<00:02:09.649> play<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.190> difference<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
Marquez would play the difference in the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.729 
Marquez would play the difference in the
matchup<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.280> obviously<00:02:13.910> would<00:02:14.590> would<00:02:15.590> be

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
matchup but it obviously would would be

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.120 
matchup but it obviously would would be
Regulus<00:02:16.340> because<00:02:16.790> he<00:02:17.660> will<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:17.989> kept<00:02:18.290> only<00:02:18.530> on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
Regulus because he will be kept only on

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.940 
Regulus because he will be kept only on
the<00:02:19.280> outside<00:02:19.790> distance<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.570> mainland
