everything<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.009> comes<00:01:36.549> with<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.820> from<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
everything that comes with it from the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
everything that comes with it from the
power<00:01:37.659> adapter<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.240> ethernet<00:01:40.240> cable

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
power adapter is to the ethernet cable

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.170 
power adapter is to the ethernet cable
it<00:01:41.710> just<00:01:42.130> looks<00:01:42.340> like<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.700> feels<00:01:42.759> like

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
something Logitech would make and I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.410 
something Logitech would make and I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
guess the quality that wildlife flat

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.120 
guess the quality that wildlife flat
Logitech<00:01:52.420> has<00:01:52.630> given<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.009> say

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
Logitech has given it and I have to say

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.880
