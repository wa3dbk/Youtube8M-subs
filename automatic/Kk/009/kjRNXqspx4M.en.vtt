00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone, I’m advertising and we are now 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.540
 make such a small reviewer 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.400
 video cards asus radeon hd 7850 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 2 gigabytes ddr5 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.600
 here is the connection pisya express 30 windows 8 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 Freddie 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:29.699
 Direction 2 Ie two coolers are awesome 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 just and strong lovers here asus not 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 I know how it is for each person 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 of course your needs your interests 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 because well, personally, I chose asus 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 you were so interesting to me + 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.430
 Asus quality does n’t matter 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.860
 excellent especially motherboards 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.230
 diesel recommended itself because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.829
 so I chose asus 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.719
 Here is such a graphics card more precisely 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:05.150
 box external here spell it all 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.630
 q this now we will look at each 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 each part of the box 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 what is it like it is written here 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.409
 duplicated ie show unpack 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.060
 I will not I think it is too much and show 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.119
 already what's inside here and the video card itself 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.299
 this box was in a box 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.290
 a little more here we are all very and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:40.799
 it's very beautiful here with us not to 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 damaged so open and here with us 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.630
 the video card itself is all packed here 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 little to nothing will not hurt us 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.479
 come back to this thing here u 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 us standard crossfire adapter 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.810
 to replace several video cards we 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.119
 before throwing away but not but 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.259
 but because I'm not going to use 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.099
 several video cards here are an adapter and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.630
 9j year as jan 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.030
 then we have a driver here 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.209
 improved returns download panagia with 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.580
 official site and manual here at 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.230
 we are all written how to put good 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.700
 go standard manual 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.080
 we think the one who buys is already 7850 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.650
 knows how to shove 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.690
 strange it sounded like such a boy 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.260
 several languages 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.690
 all and here it is and throw it there 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.739
 here's the video card itself miracle miracle 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.610
 video card 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.190
 wrapped sarafan special 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.910
 by the way, sarafan, now I 'll pull out 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.190
 and I'll show you here itself radeon 7850 2 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.880
 gigabyte ddr5 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:12.900
 this is just a crazy graphics card from 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.900
 The asus processor is certainly worth it. 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.890
 plastic here is so thin 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.390
 simple but strong enough 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.120
 no backlash no cooler all great 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.109
 so small but how not to twist two 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.799
 fan ie management 2 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.569
 copes very cool with cooling 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.859
 they really proved themselves 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.900
 here this thing is very very cool here 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.329
 we have the inscription asus that is, if an example 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.540
 from the card like this already costs me 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.480
 if anyone knows asus here correctly 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.670
 it is written that is not very much inverted 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.600
 cool here we have an adapter that is 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.590
 access to krossfaer 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.319
 because the processor itself is black like 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.120
 when black 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.629
 here we take off like a radiator 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.799
 chilling well honestly here i am 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:22.979
 watched gtx 660 chose between 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:26.039
 666 7850 but up to 660 but beautifully done not 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.699
 I know I looked it damn I fell in love 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:33.919
 but I wanted ppm I wanted 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:38.610
 Rodion it is more than 256 bits 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.490
 children x60 192bit and how I remember because 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.720
 each kind of card has its pluses here 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.820
 we have 6 pins 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.440
 additional power connection if 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.330
 who doesn't know examples yes indeed 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.680
 This video card requires additional 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.699
 nutrition is necessary and because power might 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:01.199
 there is enough food because 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:06.470
 here you need everything very, very high quality 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:11.340
 made here the plug costs him 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.729
 gum sticking out like here 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.729
 us 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.009
 I like everything dies 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.919
 I still have one mother because 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.639
 there are two slots here 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:27.690
 Yes, really a cool card 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:30.000
 cool and nothing more a little first 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.720
 from watching a video card and would like to 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.580
 something to show one remark for 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.620
 some people from who think that 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.250
 this video will somehow be on some 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:46.110
 less and god of power than me is 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.090
 struck and the fact that here you can see here 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.990
 you can read that minimum 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:55.229
 power supply 550 watts like 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.789
 as on the official site inspected 400 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.300
 500 watts 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:02.520
 550 watts is written here 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.039
 I think all the same asus recommends because 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.830
 guys if you have a cooler example 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:11.759
 master and 550 watts I will be enough 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.900
 because he is going out 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:17.800
 maximum power 600 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.990
 80 660 votkak remember because unfortunately 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.930
 if you have a power supply even 500 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:28.060
 preferably desirable to put a watt 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:30.910
 power supply 550 600 because it won't 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.729
 grab and the system will be serious 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:37.330
 tense up here as we move again 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:43.030
 let's review what we have here is how it is 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:46.320
 With a general look, let's see a very grader 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.280
 all of course done I really like 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.300
 cooling systems 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.260
 has proven itself so 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:59.949
 decently decently 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:03.490
 and this video card will be going i 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:08.289
 I think this video card that is now 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:13.169
 us the beginning of the summer of 2013 I think it is 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:17.199
 graphics card at least until 2016 will be 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:19.930
 actual and will pull almost 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.599
 all games in these three years 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.110
 then of course there will be something more powerful 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:28.630
 because as you know games games they 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.740
 so evolve so much 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:34.039
 crazy powerful 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.610
 that even expensive video cards are not always 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:39.729
 manages to pull out and they are very fast 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:42.229
 become obsolete but at the moment it is 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:45.229
 powerful enough graphics card to 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:49.449
 to try future gta 5 thanks 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:49.449
 guys for watching new meetings
