I<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:38.059> quit<00:00:39.059> boxing<00:00:39.269> and<00:00:39.629> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I think and I quit boxing and I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
I think and I quit boxing and I
basically<00:00:39.900> say<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> quit<00:00:40.620> too<00:00:40.890> early<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.220> had

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
basically say I quit too early I had

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.369 
basically say I quit too early I had
talent<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.000> good<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.809> let<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.019> go

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
talent I was good and I just let it go

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.299 
talent I was good and I just let it go
and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.430> let<00:00:44.580> my<00:00:44.730> emotions<00:00:45.379> really<00:00:46.379> dictate<00:00:46.980> my

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and I let my emotions really dictate my

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.570 
and I let my emotions really dictate my
future<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.199> he<00:00:49.199> in<00:00:49.470> a<00:00:49.769> sense<00:00:49.980> never<00:00:50.309> got<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
future and he in a sense never got a

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.250 
future and he in a sense never got a
chance<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.180> fulfilled<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:52.019> he<00:00:52.140> never

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
chance to be fulfilled because he never

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.640 
chance to be fulfilled because he never
knew<00:00:52.379> he<00:00:52.860> had<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.839> it's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> more

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
knew he had it and I think it's a more

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.340 
knew he had it and I think it's a more
of<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.860> male<00:00:56.250> thing<00:00:56.670> sometimes<00:00:57.170> where<00:00:58.170> they

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
of a male thing sometimes where they

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.259 
of a male thing sometimes where they
have<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> competitiveness<00:00:59.400> word<00:00:59.790> it<00:01:00.059> goes

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
have that competitiveness word it goes

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.080 
have that competitiveness word it goes
beyond<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.809> rationality<00:01:03.949> never<00:01:04.949> did<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.729> I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
beyond all rationality never did so I'm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
beyond all rationality never did so I'm
making<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.750> thing<00:01:07.049> very<00:01:07.080> convoluted<00:01:07.740> but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
making this thing very convoluted but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
making this thing very convoluted but
it's<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.860> retracing<00:01:10.860> your

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it's just going back and retracing your

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
it's just going back and retracing your
steps<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.580> trying<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.940> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> different

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
steps and trying to have a different

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.679 
steps and trying to have a different
outcome

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.590 

and<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.259> raises<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.829> nicer<00:01:17.130> than<00:01:17.479> Robert<00:01:18.479> De

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and he raises much nicer than Robert De

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
and he raises much nicer than Robert De
Niro's<00:01:18.960> character<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.009> he's<00:01:20.369> really

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
he's horrible but in but he does have a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.529 
he's horrible but in but he does have a
Redemption<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.649> great<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.880> he<00:01:30.090> has<00:01:30.329> to
