hello<00:00:04.990> my<00:00:05.380> name<00:00:05.530> is<00:00:05.560> Amit<00:00:05.980> and<00:00:06.340> I'm<00:00:06.430> going<00:00:06.640> to

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
hello my name is Amit and I'm going to

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.369 
hello my name is Amit and I'm going to
show<00:00:06.970> you<00:00:07.000> a<00:00:07.150> few<00:00:07.510> things<00:00:07.690> you<00:00:07.840> can<00:00:08.080> do<00:00:08.200> with

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:08.379 
show you a few things you can do with

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.430 
show you a few things you can do with
the<00:00:08.469> hand<00:00:08.769> weights<00:00:09.099> in<00:00:09.610> Pilates<00:00:10.450> we<00:00:10.480> use<00:00:10.959> very

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
the hand weights in Pilates we use very

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.009 
the hand weights in Pilates we use very
light<00:00:11.799> hand<00:00:12.280> weights<00:00:12.400> this<00:00:12.910> way<00:00:13.269> about<00:00:13.629> half<00:00:13.869> a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
light hand weights this way about half a

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.419 
light hand weights this way about half a
kilo<00:00:14.259> or<00:00:14.530> one<00:00:14.799> pound

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
kilo or one pound

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.480 
kilo or one pound
the<00:00:16.090> idea<00:00:16.390> is<00:00:16.480> to<00:00:16.900> enhance<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.890> movement<00:00:18.310> and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
the idea is to enhance the movement and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.599 
the idea is to enhance the movement and
help<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.269> experience<00:00:19.929> of<00:00:20.109> finding<00:00:20.590> your<00:00:21.250> core

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
help the experience of finding your core

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.029 
help the experience of finding your core
muscles<00:00:22.119> rather<00:00:22.720> than<00:00:23.019> to<00:00:23.230> make<00:00:23.410> your<00:00:23.619> arms

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
muscles rather than to make your arms

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.279 
muscles rather than to make your arms
very<00:00:24.220> strong<00:00:24.699> and<00:00:25.119> so<00:00:25.570> you<00:00:25.630> will<00:00:25.869> see<00:00:25.900> that<00:00:26.169> the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
very strong and so you will see that the

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.120 
very strong and so you will see that the
exercises<00:00:26.949> are<00:00:27.519> quite<00:00:28.210> specific<00:00:29.009> we're<00:00:30.009> going

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
exercises are quite specific we're going

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.800 
exercises are quite specific we're going
to<00:00:30.189> start<00:00:30.429> in<00:00:30.699> what<00:00:30.999> we<00:00:31.089> call<00:00:31.269> the<00:00:31.359> mermaid

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
to start in what we call the mermaid

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.529 
to start in what we call the mermaid
position<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:35.129> a<00:00:36.129> lot<00:00:36.640> of<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.910> work<00:00:37.180> is<00:00:37.510> in

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
position and a lot of the work is in

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.650 
position and a lot of the work is in
actually<00:00:38.170> supporting<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:40.000> weight<00:00:40.300> of<00:00:40.539> the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
actually supporting the weight of the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.849 
actually supporting the weight of the
body<00:00:40.870> my<00:00:42.090> supporting<00:00:43.090> arm<00:00:43.360> is<00:00:43.629> working<00:00:44.379> the

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
body my supporting arm is working the

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.670 
body my supporting arm is working the
shoulder<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.460> working<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.270> I<00:00:47.140> can<00:00:47.320> do<00:00:47.440> all

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
shoulder is working and I can do all

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.939 
shoulder is working and I can do all
kinds<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.539> variations<00:00:49.539> with<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:50.020> arms<00:00:50.410> which

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
kinds of variations with the arms which

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.959 
kinds of variations with the arms which
look<00:00:51.250> very<00:00:51.670> easy<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.920> do<00:00:54.100> but<00:00:54.820> actually

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
look very easy to do but actually

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.869 
look very easy to do but actually
they're<00:00:55.390> not<00:00:55.420> as<00:00:55.960> easy<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.800> do<00:00:57.100> definitely<00:00:57.670> not

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
they're not as easy to do definitely not

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.289 
they're not as easy to do definitely not
when<00:00:58.090> it's<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.539> context<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.379> a<00:01:00.129> class<00:01:03.299> okay

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
when it's in the context of a class okay

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.840 
when it's in the context of a class okay
if<00:01:04.420> we<00:01:04.540> want<00:01:04.689> to<00:01:04.780> go<00:01:04.960> beyond<00:01:05.409> that<00:01:05.530> range<00:01:06.009> we

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
if we want to go beyond that range we

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.870 
if we want to go beyond that range we
can<00:01:06.970> also<00:01:07.180> go<00:01:07.920> behind<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.130> body<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.700> can

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
can also go behind the body and we can

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.940 
can also go behind the body and we can
also<00:01:13.060> take<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.900> into<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.290> bigger<00:01:14.650> movement<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
also take it into a bigger movement and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.510 
also take it into a bigger movement and
as<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.939> lift<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.420> arm<00:01:19.650> above<00:01:20.650> shoulder

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
as you lift the arm above shoulder

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.870 
as you lift the arm above shoulder
height<00:01:21.549> it<00:01:22.329> becomes<00:01:23.170> way<00:01:23.619> more<00:01:23.920> difficult<00:01:24.159> for

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
height it becomes way more difficult for

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.200 
height it becomes way more difficult for
more<00:01:25.090> people<00:01:26.070> next<00:01:27.070> I'm<00:01:27.189> gonna<00:01:27.310> go<00:01:27.579> on<00:01:27.850> all

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
more people next I'm gonna go on all

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.050 
more people next I'm gonna go on all
fours<00:01:28.630> once<00:01:29.500> again<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.430> supporting

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
fours once again just supporting

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.840 
fours once again just supporting
yourself<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.780> all<00:01:32.409> fours<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:32.979> challenging<00:01:33.640> and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
yourself on all fours is challenging and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.270 
yourself on all fours is challenging and
doing<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.270> on<00:01:34.390> one<00:01:34.630> arm<00:01:34.920> becomes<00:01:35.920> more

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
doing so on one arm becomes more

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.330 
doing so on one arm becomes more
challenging<00:01:36.939> so<00:01:37.659> really<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.530> arm<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:39.009> works

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
challenging so really the arm that works

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.010 
challenging so really the arm that works
with<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.909> weight<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:42.070> not<00:01:42.490> necessarily<00:01:43.090> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
with the weight is not necessarily the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.840 
with the weight is not necessarily the
hardest<00:01:44.560> thing<00:01:44.860> about<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:47.350> add

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
hardest thing about it but you can add

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.050 
hardest thing about it but you can add
different<00:01:48.850> challenges<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.670> going<00:01:51.969> to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
different challenges and it's going to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.569 
different challenges and it's going to
throw<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.930> center<00:01:53.829> of<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.070> body<00:01:54.219> slightly

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
throw the center of the body slightly

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.740 
throw the center of the body slightly
off<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.079> do<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.500> different<00:01:56.860> variations

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
off when you do the different variations

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.320 
off when you do the different variations
with<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.899> arms

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.800 

once<00:02:04.510> again<00:02:04.900> taking<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.470> arm<00:02:05.790> above<00:02:06.810> shoulder

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
once again taking the arm above shoulder

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.160 
once again taking the arm above shoulder
height<00:02:07.860> towards<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> head<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:10.050> where<00:02:11.050> it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
height towards the head is where it

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.620 
height towards the head is where it
becomes<00:02:11.320> way<00:02:12.220> more<00:02:12.700> difficult<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.340> again<00:02:15.910> you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
becomes way more difficult and again you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.450 
becomes way more difficult and again you
can<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:16.960> all<00:02:17.200> kinds<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:18.510> variations<00:02:19.510> here<00:02:20.460> next

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
can do all kinds of variations here next

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.310 
can do all kinds of variations here next
we're<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.090> go<00:02:22.240> into<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.570> high<00:02:22.840> kneeling

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
we're going to go into the high kneeling

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.130 
we're going to go into the high kneeling
position<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.850> can<00:02:25.150> be<00:02:25.330> done<00:02:25.480> standing<00:02:25.990> as

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
position this can be done standing as

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.790 
position this can be done standing as
well<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.190> be<00:02:27.310> done<00:02:27.430> standing<00:02:28.680> against<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
well it can be done standing against a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.790 
well it can be done standing against a
wall<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.310> small<00:02:33.310> or<00:02:34.800> below

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
wall and we can do small or below

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.840 
wall and we can do small or below
shoulder<00:02:36.190> height<00:02:36.900> circles<00:02:37.900> as<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.950> arms<00:02:39.580> move

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
shoulder height circles as the arms move

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.600 
shoulder height circles as the arms move
away<00:02:40.120> from<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> body<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.980> becomes<00:02:42.130> more

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
away from the body it becomes more

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.300 
away from the body it becomes more
difficult<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.570> stabilize<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.380> body<00:02:44.560> doing

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
difficult to stabilize the body doing

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.330 
difficult to stabilize the body doing
this<00:02:45.610> exercises<00:02:46.360> with<00:02:46.780> heavier<00:02:47.590> weights<00:02:47.650> will

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
this exercises with heavier weights will

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.830 
this exercises with heavier weights will
become<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:49.350> completely<00:02:50.350> different<00:02:50.650> story

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
become a completely different story

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.450 
become a completely different story
much<00:02:52.840> more<00:02:53.050> challenging<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.800> arms<00:02:54.220> and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
much more challenging on the arms and

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.980 
much more challenging on the arms and
maybe<00:02:55.410> less<00:02:56.410> attention<00:02:57.130> will<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.630> core

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
maybe less attention will be on the core

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.170 
maybe less attention will be on the core
you<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.160> do<00:03:00.280> little<00:03:00.460> circles<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:03.190> just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
you can do little circles that are just

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.780 
you can do little circles that are just
in<00:03:04.300> one<00:03:04.570> place<00:03:04.930> or<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.800> do<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.100> circles

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
in one place or you can do the circles

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.840 
in one place or you can do the circles
as<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:08.350> move<00:03:09.660> within<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.840> bigger<00:03:11.170> circles

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.220

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
this exercise can go similar to before

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.229 
this exercise can go similar to before
into<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> side<00:03:47.709> Bend<00:03:50.040> again<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.550> emphasis<00:03:52.090> is

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
into a side Bend again the emphasis is

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.050 
into a side Bend again the emphasis is
always<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.020> be<00:03:53.170> on<00:03:53.590> what<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.550> feels<00:03:54.880> like

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
always going to be on what it feels like

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.570 
always going to be on what it feels like
to<00:03:55.630> integrate<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.880> arms<00:03:58.330> with<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> weight

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
to integrate the arms with the weight

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.039 
to integrate the arms with the weight
into<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.820> core

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.339 

we<00:04:08.049> can<00:04:08.230> do<00:04:08.640> bicep<00:04:09.640> curls<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.930> not<00:04:11.140> going<00:04:11.290> to

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
we can do bicep curls it's not going to

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.500 
we can do bicep curls it's not going to
strengthen<00:04:11.560> your<00:04:11.799> biceps<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.370> much<00:04:12.819> but

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
strengthen your biceps that much but

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.149 
strengthen your biceps that much but
it's<00:04:13.629> definitely<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.439> to<00:04:14.560> strengthen<00:04:14.829> your

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
it's definitely going to strengthen your

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:21.420 
it's definitely going to strengthen your
whole<00:04:15.400> body<00:04:15.700> as<00:04:15.969> a<00:04:16.449> moving<00:04:17.109> unit<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
whole body as a moving unit and the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.129 
whole body as a moving unit and the
weight<00:04:21.669> are<00:04:21.910> definitely<00:04:22.449> going<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.750> give<00:04:23.020> you

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
weight are definitely going to give you

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.640 
weight are definitely going to give you
a<00:04:23.169> sense<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.820> why<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.840> need<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.110> stabilize

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
a sense of why you need to stabilize

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.580 
a sense of why you need to stabilize
your<00:04:26.830> core<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.759> then<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.900> other<00:04:29.050> position

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
your core and then the other position

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.689 
your core and then the other position
would<00:04:29.800> be<00:04:30.900> standing<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:32.139> a<00:04:32.949> hinge<00:04:33.250> forward

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
would be standing in a hinge forward

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.230 
would be standing in a hinge forward
trying<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.660> get<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.960> upper<00:04:35.320> body<00:04:35.350> parallel<00:04:36.240> to

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
trying to get the upper body parallel to

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.990 
trying to get the upper body parallel to
the<00:04:37.360> ground<00:04:37.690> which<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.710> position<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.520> is

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
the ground which is a position that is

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.270 
the ground which is a position that is
difficult<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.750> support<00:04:41.199> in<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:41.889> itself

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
difficult to support in and of itself

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.460 
difficult to support in and of itself
and<00:04:45.280> we<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:45.520> do<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.940> hug<00:04:46.570> or<00:04:47.280> butterflies<00:04:48.280> and

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
and we can do the hug or butterflies and

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.900 
and we can do the hug or butterflies and
again<00:04:50.470> if<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:51.009> want<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.370> really<00:04:51.550> challenge

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
again if we want to really challenge

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.900 
again if we want to really challenge
ourselves<00:04:52.199> we<00:04:53.199> can<00:04:53.410> do<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.910> overhead

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
ourselves we can do the overhead

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.830 
ourselves we can do the overhead
movements<00:04:58.110> which<00:04:59.110> are<00:04:59.320> very<00:04:59.530> difficult<00:04:59.800> and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
movements which are very difficult and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.950 
movements which are very difficult and
plenty<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.979> other<00:05:02.979> variations<00:05:03.849> the<00:05:04.750> weights

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
plenty of other variations the weights

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.710 
plenty of other variations the weights
are<00:05:05.139> very<00:05:05.500> very<00:05:05.800> useful<00:05:06.130> in<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:07.120> classes<00:05:07.599> and

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
are very very useful in the classes and

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.290 
are very very useful in the classes and
again<00:05:08.289> half<00:05:09.009> a<00:05:09.160> kilo<00:05:09.370> would<00:05:09.849> definitely

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
again half a kilo would definitely

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.659 
again half a kilo would definitely
suffice
