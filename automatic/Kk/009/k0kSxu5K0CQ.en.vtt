00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.199
 leonardo campos and start another one now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 typical computer programming 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.420
 that's vip 22 and today in the days to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.480
 personal computer, we go, I go 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.480
 teaching here is how to do a cleaning and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 cleanup files on your local disk 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.350
 if in your hd a super clean then 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.050
 Let's go to this lesson now on our channel. 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.870
 Good, I 'm already here in my area. 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 work and this procedure is a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.050
 very good practice procedure of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 Be done 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 you go to inas your keyboard you go 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.850
 hold will ensure together 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 together with the button on the windows 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.860
 the lyrics are for those who do not know if the button 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.250
 windows people and stay there in the corner 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 bottom left of your keyboard between 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 it is right in the middle of the control key and the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 alt key right in the middle has the flag 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 including some keyboard has the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.200
 positive symbol on that little hand 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.869
 but this is the button, so you 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.600
 sure he held it at the same time 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:35.150
 appear here in this window 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:39.090
 Are you going to write this here ? 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.680
 Just like you see there. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.079
 on your monitor 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.750
 After you have done this you will give the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.710
 before the coup explain some 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.790
 things for you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.340
 this here he will do and will analyze 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.049
 space on your local drive I know you can 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.100
 be released and clearing system errors 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.460
 of copy files and everything else 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.239
 It's now the procedure I'm going to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.610
 teach in this setting 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.440
 that I will be showing here that is the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.710
 more important because 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.760
 principle is that it does not check all the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.410
 and I'll give you the okay to see you notice that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.840
 what he is examining the aet 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.440
 examine kilo of memory chips and I 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.830
 of the system, only what he examines then 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.930
 here 's mine too because this is me 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.020
 I do all the circles and today I gave 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.030
 as would the other right of watering should 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.470
 I waited but I did not even know what 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.870
 take this class today 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.020
 so there's practically nothing here but 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.050
 notice person he did not examine him 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.470
 in the exam of the windows defender he does not 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.990
 examined the windows update windows update 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.470
 is that windows system right? 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.810
 What program do you program it for? 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.640
 updates and indirectly your 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.620
 computer and it always 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.720
 update it hunters authors 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.700
 important update your character 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.340
 He is not there, you have to 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.350
 make the gardens already 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 optional you make you want 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.630
 so it takes the windows update and 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.890
 you get these important updates and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.500
 it was on your computer 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.590
 only that he makes copies of these files and 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.930
 these personal copies are unnecessary 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.230
 So you have an idea when I did it here. 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.690
 in mine, I was giving copies of these 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.110
 Windows things pt is giving me 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.250
 released five hundred and thirty-somethings already 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:47.610
 was 1539 mega byte there from my local drive 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.950
 to be or is is practically no more a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.040
 a little more energy then it's a lot 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.989
 thing that gets you to your hd and 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.280
 necessary 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.650
 Something else I want to talk about too. 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.350
 that when we eliminate these 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.890
 files these copies of windows update 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.380
 the one from where you can no longer 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.150
 you want to uninstall an update 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.519
 You can not 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.040
 honestly I do not know anyone who 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.310
 install updates that 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.489
 as I said updates are 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.680
 important 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.690
 I'll put here already to program 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.820
 So you notice that he made a 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.830
 but did not check 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.210
 complete to do this verification 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.360
 complete below 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.410
 You come here oh that button ok olimpa 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.139
 system files 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.099
 these files copies the programs 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.840
 do and stay there let's analyze goes 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.690
 a window appears here 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.849
 it appeared then there is update here 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.900
 said the chaque memories I examined 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.960
 again 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.569
 it is in that normal procedure it looks only 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.830
 is examining cleaning windows 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:59.639
 update did not do this again then 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.660
 to make a more complete cleaning you 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.560
 have to do said 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.380
 that way I liked for you to 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.590
 suddenly it will take a few minutes 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.070
 he he's examining everything it does a 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.330
 use more threaten more complete while 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.639

 well come on, it's already opened here then 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.180
 I see that now here 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:07.020
 he got files here from windows 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:11.190
 to defend copy files not necessary 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.289
 He already pointed out that there are other things 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.849
 on here 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:21.240
 I think it just scored some things I 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:25.139
 I can mark the other may want 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.749
 do because holy things in a will 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.740
 to interfere in nothing is not here is 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:35.369
 everything marked already the other 10 byte né 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.639
 I do not need to score anymore clicked more 

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:42.240
 You come here to give me an okay feeling. 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.759
 that he was cleaning units and going 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.800

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.919
 enough 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:55.319
 so he did the personal cleaning hd is é 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.139
 he was able to release the space he 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:01.199
 said it showed there that it would release to you. 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.419
 have an idea the first time 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:07.349
 This complete way teaches you how to 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:09.389
 You even appeared because you do not have 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.550
 more files he wanted to delete right 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.939
