00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.860
 the most known menu to control 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.110
 Our system is the control panel 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.029
 from there we have a large number 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.189
 of tools from which we can 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.530
 control our system but in 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.690
 occasions some control functions or 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.730
 customization are even more hidden 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.050
 in the system and it's not easy to access 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.820
 they 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.769
 God's mode of windows is a menu 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.960
 hidden in the system with a large number 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.420
 of tools and options that so 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.970
 are not activated in the system 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.890
 by default from the god mode we can 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.800
 control users manage 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.750
 credentials change the language modify 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.550
 the task bars and so on 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.170
 practically any aspect of 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 windows can be configured and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.640
 managed from this menu god mode 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.470
 It is available for windows vista 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.470
 windows 7 and windows 8 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 to begin we will download the file 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.900
 that I will leave in the description 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 right click and extract here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.659
 this text file contains the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.320
 instructions to activate god mode 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.240
 besides the code that we will need 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.780
 the first step is to create a new 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 binder 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 now we open the file again 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.619
 text and we copy the following code without 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.619
 leave no blank 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.680
 and we leave it as the name of the folder 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.680
 created 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.720
 automatically changed the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.720
 icon and the name of the folder 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.220
 as we can see in this window we have 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.229
 all the options and tools that 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.229
 we can configure inside windows 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.500
 see you soon
