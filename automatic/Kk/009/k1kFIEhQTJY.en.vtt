00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.290
 I sent health institutions 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.029
 Free are welcome to a boxing 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.970
 an external hard drive of the brand 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.430
 digital western if you are the model is my 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.490
 ultra passport on this occasion we have 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.470
 a special edition commemorating 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.779
 10 years celebrating 10 years maybe of the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.419
 mark I'm not sure those 10 years of 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.390
 they are but we are supposed to have a 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.730
 metal edition metal editions 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.250
 they come in this color silver color comes 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.440
 in purple and comes in golden color 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.899
 yes they are three colors to me personally 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.760
 I liked silver more I do not know it looks like 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.280
 more aesthetic what happens is that the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.100
 golden does not look like golden actually 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.260
 see how an ugly yellowish does not look weird 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.059
 and the purple looks more black than purple 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.679
 then I preferred to improve this cd more 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.359
 elegant ok 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.909
 we have two terabytes gentlemen we are going to 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.280
 see then the front says that 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.530
 it's aluminum design says backing and 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.560
 security and service a cloud of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.480
 dropbox I do not know if it comes for free how much 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.980
 free storage or something no no 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.780
 I understand this or you are simply 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.800
 promoting storage in the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.440
 dropbox cloud 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.960
 now as I repeat two terabytes but 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.700
 in practice this translates 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.650
 approximately 1.80 byte free for 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.920
 the user this is because the companies 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.550
 always use their ability 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.000
 they use approximately 300 mb 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.920
 sorry 300 gb for this storage 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.540
 of the system the hard drive for the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.490
 hard disk operation in order to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.260
 accounts is something that I always criticized 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.210
 I do not know why it is that companies 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.780
 if they are going to do that if they are going to remove you 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.850
 storage space so that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.310
 let's say system functions I do not know by 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.980
 what do they each put you on, instead of 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.960
 two terabytes put you 2.3 work for 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.610
 that way that way when you use that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.530
 space for the operation of 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.450
 so there is no problem and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.300
 The two free jobs remain for you 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.490
 but good then we have storage 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.460
 premium ok and three year warranty 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.080
 directly with the brand and for this 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.060
 lateral we have nothing more than the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.340
 logo and compatibility is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.770
 compatible with windows 8 is also 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.160
 compatible with mac do not worry about 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.560
 that and usb 3.0 yes 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.530
 If you do not have USB 3.0 there are no problems 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.870
 you can use the usb 2.0 obviously 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.340
 without the advantages of speed that is given 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.030
 the 3.0 can be back we have 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.390
 maps by ultra metal vision and over here 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.790
 it says in elegant aluminum design 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.650
 backup local and in the cloud by 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.520
 middle of dropbox and finally 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.010
 256 bugs hardware encoding 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.810
 it means that it is quite safe 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.610
 they can put password is what I 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.000
 I understand I do not know how I tell them just 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.850
 I'm invoking I do not know exactly good 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.690
 we have on the other hand the same my 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.960
 passport ultra I give division and they say 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.880
 included functions say in western 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.860
 digital smartware pro local i 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.870
 and storage in the cloud or what's 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.000
 backing in the new protection with 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.790
 password a drop service or 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.960
 integrated and nothing more than now with the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.660
 part of above we have the content 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.550
 content says around here the portable farc 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.180
 lars and the hard drive obviously a cable 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.820
 usb the western digital smartware pro 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.700
 software will bring a software included and 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.530
 a quick start installation guide 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
 free ok for the low good part 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.790
 we have nonsense of the sl number and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.250
 all of that let's proceed then with 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.650
 the opening gentlemen 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.120
 will give us criteria that is followed and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.060
 For this, we are going to use our 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.950
 our patented rule for a boxing 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.570
 customers is exclusive for a boxing 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.120
 do not believe that I use them for my work 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.670
 or nothing very well we have managed to remove the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.750
 sellito on this side let's start 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750
 then to open the box 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.470
 this we remove the little eyelash we raise 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.230
 here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.430
 and in this way we remove the whole tray 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.440
 Who our future is coming from 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.150
 Hello 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.180
 has like stuck with something that rays with 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.850
 the blackout what happens who knows very 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.520
 well we can get it out of the box with 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.560
 a lot of work by the way a lot of work and 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.480
 nothing of care and as we see here and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.870
 it's completely empty there's nothing else 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.320
 that show now we have the content 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.320
 principal 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.560
 first we are going to start usb cable 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.120
 as well as they see forgiveness the port that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.090
 is connected to our hard drive 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.190
 Laptop is very different from what comes 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.090
 being a traditional usb port or a 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.270
 usb but as for the whole computer 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.100
 Obviously it is already a USB 3.0 port 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.479
 conventional without any problem is a 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.130
 pretty short tablet I'm going to take it out 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.520
 to see more or less of the length 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.520
 of the cable 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.839
 is how you see is a pretty short cable 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.479
 goes from the end to the end of the 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.429
 camera is over here I have our rule 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.749
 of a boxing our super mega rule 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:24.779
 of a boxer let's see how much it measures 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.189
 well here is 30 centimeters we calculate 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:30.959
 you do not have to do it either so 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:33.089
 I need about 35 centimeters if about 35 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.439
 centimeters of length sirs is what 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:37.460
 that has that usb cable 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:40.759
 now we have here 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.470
 manuals on the bottom 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.410
 obviously the software that comes bundled 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.750
 is inside the hard drive so that 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.160
 put a disc here yes of all 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.569
 ways are giving a hard drive in 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.330
 where the software can be stored 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.880
 well there it is here we have our guide 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.330
 Quick start without any problem 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.970
 and our our guarantee policy 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.590
 basically it will not be that kind of thing that 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.080
 I do not feel like 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.320
 here we have the most important gentlemen 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.810
 all emphasize that the truth is that you see 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:17.910
 incredible it looks amazing design or 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.880
 I was completely left in love 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.860
 of good design 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.940
 back forgiveness part the lateral 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.700
 we have the usb connector itself and this is the 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.230
 LED indicator of operation of 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.640
 hard drive obviously down vary 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.830
 as the hard disk is 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.510
 using these other laterals not 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.970
 we have absolutely nobody for the part 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.070
 below, we have simply 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.010
 numbers of serial numbers and then 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.080
 little things like that my passport ultra half of 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.449
 edit and nothing else 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.180
 ok this part watch them listen 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.939
 it's plastic a scratchy plastic the 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.270
 only part of metal is this part of 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:00.189
 up and the sides only good 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.599
 something that I eat like they can observe it 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.960
 here in the video something that is not me 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:07.029
 looking is that his fingers are stuck 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.249

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.129
 in the end I want it I do not want it 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.809
 to be moving but to have what 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.759
 fixed in one place so this 

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:20.979
 I just clean it and nothing happens 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.710
