00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.830
 welcome everyone to this new one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.450
 welcome stress tutorials 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 today I will explain to you how to play games 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.960
 android on your computer 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.699
 then first of all we would have two tests 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.770
 this program is called start 2 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.790
 BlueStacks 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.290
 maran android to windows by speak 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.630
 great download now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.420
 but I've already remembered this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.420
 completely free application 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 then 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.780
 I have to do 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.780
 we see 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 that is, they open up 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.520
 remember that with this application it is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.560
 still in beta 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.040
 but without any picture related to 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.040
 games applications 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.890
 sestio 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.480
 perfect as they can give 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.800
 look at this is like having 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.870
 how to use device when you go to 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.540
 however, play normally on your own 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.100
 computer and you can use them all 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.620
 but I say all the applications that are 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.620
 present in the android market 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.470
 even whatsapp 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.240

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.159
 I still have to download benefitterei 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.960
 just have to click that download 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.350
 instead of downloading we have games 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.240

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.470
 instead of going to read all those 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.509

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.580

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.689

 I do not have a smartphone screen 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.149
