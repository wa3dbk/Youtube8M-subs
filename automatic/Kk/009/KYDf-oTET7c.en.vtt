with<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.060> time<00:01:57.299> both<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.380> weapons<00:01:58.799> are

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
with some time both these weapons are

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
fairly cheap in the real world market
and<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:01.229> probably<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.649> cheap<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> game

so<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.540> may<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.750> early<00:02:04.140> weapons<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.820> with<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so they may be early weapons and with it

so they may be early weapons and with it
being<00:02:05.969> cheap<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.780> consequences<00:02:07.530> both

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220

about<00:02:14.799> is<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.459> shotgun<00:02:15.819> we<00:02:16.719> see<00:02:16.900> Rico

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
holding we can definitely see it's a

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.720 
holding we can definitely see it's a
pump-action<00:02:19.569> shotgun<00:02:20.290> which<00:02:20.439> looks<00:02:20.739> also<00:02:21.579> to

quite a good secondary weapon when you
went<00:02:28.239> up<00:02:28.390> close<00:02:28.750> or<00:02:29.260> she<00:02:29.469> had<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.769> lmg<00:02:30.459> or<00:02:30.670> our

generic assault rifle and games but

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.110 
generic assault rifle and games but

shooting with a submachine gun in my
opinion<00:03:17.349> it<00:03:17.650> looks<00:03:17.889> like<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.159> ICS<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:19.030> for

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
opinion it looks like the ICS and for

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.210 
opinion it looks like the ICS and for
pistol<00:03:19.840> which<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.169> generally<00:03:20.530> known<00:03:20.919> to<00:03:21.099> be

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
fast firing again it's probably just

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.170 
fast firing again it's probably just
going<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.099> be<00:03:24.159> called<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> submachine<00:03:24.760> gun

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
going to be called the submachine gun

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.860 
going to be called the submachine gun
but<00:03:25.810> that's<00:03:26.049> what<00:03:26.229> the<00:03:26.319> model<00:03:26.470> remains<00:03:26.769> me<00:03:27.129> off

looking<00:03:28.870> at<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.049> same<00:03:29.229> shot<00:03:29.500> we<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.709> see

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
looking at the same shot we can see

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.439 
looking at the same shot we can see
another<00:03:30.129> rocket<00:03:30.519> launcher<00:03:30.819> like<00:03:30.970> weapon<00:03:31.329> on

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
another rocket launcher like weapon on

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.939 
another rocket launcher like weapon on
recos<00:03:31.750> back<00:03:32.019> which<00:03:32.409> looks<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.829> be<00:03:32.919> very

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
recos back which looks to be very

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.490 
recos back which looks to be very
similar<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.639> m-72<00:03:34.419> law<00:03:34.780> which<00:03:35.290> is

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
similar to the m-72 law which is

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.259 
similar to the m-72 law which is
generally<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:36.010> one<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.519> sort<00:03:36.819> of<00:03:36.879> thing<00:03:37.060> it

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
generally a one you sort of thing it

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.449 
generally a one you sort of thing it
contains<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.169> high-powered<00:03:38.709> rocket<00:03:39.069> within<00:03:39.310> it

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
contains a high-powered rocket within it

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.240 
contains a high-powered rocket within it
and<00:03:39.609> upon<00:03:40.379> activating<00:03:41.379> you<00:03:41.530> came<00:03:41.829> to<00:03:41.979> have<00:03:42.129> to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and upon activating you came to have to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.009 
and upon activating you came to have to
fire<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.609> soon<00:03:42.819> so<00:03:43.209> I'm<00:03:43.299> guessing<00:03:43.509> it<00:03:43.750> or<00:03:43.870> will

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
fire it soon so I'm guessing it or will

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.619 
fire it soon so I'm guessing it or will
be<00:03:44.199> a<00:03:44.470> fairly<00:03:44.709> disposable<00:03:45.430> weapon<00:03:45.729> I'm<00:03:45.879> not

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
be a fairly disposable weapon I'm not

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.969 
be a fairly disposable weapon I'm not
just<00:03:46.810> talking<00:03:46.870> about<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.229> weapon<00:03:47.530> as<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> whole

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
just talking about the weapon as a whole

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.589 
just talking about the weapon as a whole
I'm<00:03:48.220> meaning<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.669> will<00:03:48.729> be<00:03:48.849> pretty<00:03:49.060> cheap<00:03:49.389> if

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
I'm meaning it will be pretty cheap if

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.740 
I'm meaning it will be pretty cheap if
it<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.409> law<00:03:51.060> another<00:03:52.060> weapon<00:03:52.239> I<00:03:52.419> loved<00:03:52.629> in

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
it is the law another weapon I loved in

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.469 
it is the law another weapon I loved in
just<00:03:53.019> goes<00:03:53.199> to<00:03:53.409> was<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.979> machine<00:03:54.280> gun<00:03:54.459> or<00:03:54.639> lmg

just goes to was the machine gun or lmg

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.199 
just goes to was the machine gun or lmg
and<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.530> short<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.889> gameplay<00:03:57.519> trailer<00:03:57.849> looked

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
and the short of gameplay trailer looked

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.210 
and the short of gameplay trailer looked
pretty<00:03:58.449> cool<00:03:58.629> to<00:03:58.810> me<00:03:58.840> showing<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.769> very<00:03:59.949> clear

pretty cool to me showing a very clear

pretty cool to me showing a very clear

kick ass and in just cause 3 it fits
perfectly<00:04:12.159> into<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.579> theme<00:04:12.759> of<00:04:12.970> chaos<00:04:13.449> the

perfectly into the theme of chaos the

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.509 
perfectly into the theme of chaos the
only<00:04:14.290> sad<00:04:14.439> thing<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:14.709> when<00:04:15.189> you're<00:04:15.370> walking

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
around with it your movement speed is

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.740 
around with it your movement speed is
horribly<00:04:17.680> slow<00:04:17.919> but<00:04:18.789> you've<00:04:19.180> got<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.359> nerf<00:04:19.599> at

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
horribly slow but you've got a nerf at

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.060 
horribly slow but you've got a nerf at
some<00:04:20.049> point<00:04:20.259> right

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
some point right

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.850 
some point right
so<00:04:21.640> one<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> fans<00:04:22.570> has<00:04:22.960> an<00:04:22.990> idea<00:04:23.620> for<00:04:23.830> our

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
so one of the fans has an idea for our

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010 
so one of the fans has an idea for our
turn<00:04:24.130> weapon<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.670> definitely<00:04:25.240> agree<00:04:25.570> with<00:04:25.870> it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
turn weapon I definitely agree with it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.650 
turn weapon I definitely agree with it
the<00:04:26.590> bubble<00:04:26.920> blaster<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:27.940> remember<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.540> was

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
the bubble blaster but remember it was

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.230 
the bubble blaster but remember it was
very<00:04:28.900> very<00:04:29.200> crappy<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:30.520> was<00:04:30.700> more<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.000> jewel

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
very very crappy it was more of a jewel

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.750 
very very crappy it was more of a jewel
weapon<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.720> just<00:04:32.020> cause<00:04:32.170> 2<00:04:32.560> pretty<00:04:33.280> much<00:04:33.400> no

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
weapon in just cause 2 pretty much no

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.420 
weapon in just cause 2 pretty much no
use<00:04:33.970> at<00:04:34.120> all<00:04:34.300> but<00:04:35.110> instead<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.770> being<00:04:35.980> useless

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
use at all but instead of being useless

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.910 
use at all but instead of being useless
it<00:04:37.000> traps<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.630> enemies<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.410> bubble<00:04:38.770> and

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
it traps the enemies in a bubble and

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.980 
it traps the enemies in a bubble and
when<00:04:39.880> they're<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.180> bubble<00:04:40.450> we<00:04:40.600> can<00:04:40.750> fly

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
when they're in the bubble we can fly

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.620 
when they're in the bubble we can fly
away<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.380> popper<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:41.950> certain<00:04:42.340> height<00:04:42.550> or<00:04:42.850> when

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
away and popper a certain height or when

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.660 
away and popper a certain height or when
it<00:04:43.750> was<00:04:43.900> shot<00:04:44.170> at<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.440> when<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.190> bubble<00:04:45.460> pops

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
it was shot at and when the bubble pops

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.330 
it was shot at and when the bubble pops
the<00:04:45.970> enemy<00:04:46.240> will<00:04:46.480> fall<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.020> possibly<00:04:47.050> die<00:04:47.950> I

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
the enemy will fall and possibly die I

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.980 
the enemy will fall and possibly die I
think<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:49.120> would<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.330> pretty<00:04:49.660> goddamn

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
think this would be pretty goddamn

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.290 
think this would be pretty goddamn
satisfying<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:51.190> would<00:04:51.340> be<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.670> good<00:04:51.940> jockey

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
satisfying and it would be a good jockey

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.690 
satisfying and it would be a good jockey
