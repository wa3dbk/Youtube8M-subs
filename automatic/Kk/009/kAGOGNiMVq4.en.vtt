to yeah this arm is much looser than
this<00:01:56.289> one<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:59.380> can<00:01:59.649> go<00:01:59.830> all<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> way

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
this one but they can go all the way

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.790 
this one but they can go all the way
around<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:02.170> really<00:02:02.350> cool<00:02:04.500> yeah<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.530> don't
