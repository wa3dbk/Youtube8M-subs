00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
can he bring to the club the perhaps was

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.220 
can he bring to the club the perhaps was
wasn't<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.480> under<00:00:45.809> bleachers<00:00:46.670> well<00:00:48.230> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
wasn't there under bleachers well it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.510 
wasn't there under bleachers well it's
it's<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> difficult<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.340> club

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's a difficult time for the club

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's a difficult time for the club
anyway<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.090> evers<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> charge<00:00:51.780> because

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
anyway you know evers in charge because

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
anyway you know evers in charge because
of<00:00:52.110> what's<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.620> upstairs<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.610> think

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
of what's going on upstairs but I think

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.580 
of what's going on upstairs but I think
he'll<00:00:54.329> switch<00:00:54.600> off<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> bring<00:00:55.440> us

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
he'll switch off from that and bring us

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.260 
he'll switch off from that and bring us
stability<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> calmness<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
stability in the calmness to the to the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
stability in the calmness to the to the
plane<00:00:57.570> staff<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> football<00:00:59.039> side

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
plane staff so that to the football side

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.799 
plane staff so that to the football side
of<00:00:59.460> things<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.940> maybe<00:01:00.120> wasn't<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.660> last

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of things that maybe wasn't there last

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.590 
of things that maybe wasn't there last
seen<00:01:01.550> he's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.760> honest<00:01:03.090> manager<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> think

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
seen he's a very honest manager I think

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.469 
seen he's a very honest manager I think
he'll<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.700> straight<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> players<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
he'll be straight with the players in

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
he'll be straight with the players in
terms<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.260> he<00:01:07.350> wants<00:01:07.680> who<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:08.010> wants<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
terms of what he wants who he wants and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.350 
terms of what he wants who he wants and
who<00:01:09.180> he<00:01:09.270> doesn't<00:01:09.570> wanna<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> club<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
who he doesn't wanna the club and I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880 
who he doesn't wanna the club and I
think<00:01:12.600> his<00:01:12.720> honesty<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.229> humility<00:01:13.470> will

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
think his honesty and humility will

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
think his honesty and humility will
create<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.540> really<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.720> play<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> was

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
create a really good play and that was

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.539 
create a really good play and that was
fear<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> players<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> know<00:01:17.369> they'll

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
fear for the players you know they'll

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.950 
fear for the players you know they'll
want<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> play<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.210> him<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.810> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
want to play for him I think all we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
want to play for him I think all we
certainly<00:01:19.259> did<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> them<00:01:19.860> anyway<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
certainly did it for them anyway so I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.390 
certainly did it for them anyway so I
think<00:01:20.970> he'll<00:01:21.240> bring<00:01:21.390> lots<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.720> qualities<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
think he'll bring lots of qualities and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
think he'll bring lots of qualities and
winning<00:01:23.400> football<00:01:23.520> matches<00:01:24.060> primarily<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
winning football matches primarily but I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160 
winning football matches primarily but I
think<00:01:25.409> he'll<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.240> exactly<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.840> they<00:01:27.960> need

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
think he'll be exactly what they need

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
think he'll be exactly what they need
you've<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> you've<00:01:30.150> touched<00:01:30.390> me<00:01:30.570> early<00:01:30.810> if

you had a great record against United

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
you had a great record against United
what<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.259> what's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
what do you think that is what's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
what do you think that is what's

which<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.430> important<00:02:12.030> for<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> players<00:02:12.510> we've

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

higher areas of the pitch we we also

higher areas of the pitch we we also
want<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:28.950> he<00:02:29.100> wants<00:02:29.370> us<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.580> try<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:29.940> win

the<00:02:30.180> ball<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> bit<00:02:30.600> higher<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.080> pitch<00:02:31.110> which

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the ball a bit higher up the pitch which

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.640 
the ball a bit higher up the pitch which
is<00:02:31.560> something<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:33.660> didn't<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.410> much

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
is something that we didn't do so much

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.860 
is something that we didn't do so much
under<00:02:35.190> Roy<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.090> either<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.510> better<00:02:36.750> than

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
under Roy not that either is better than

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.030 
under Roy not that either is better than
the<00:02:37.019> other<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.380> each<00:02:37.620> game<00:02:37.890> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the other you know each game is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.650 
the other you know each game is
different<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.519> like<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.480> going

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
different if you like but there's going

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.390 
different if you like but there's going
to<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.840> few<00:02:40.140> tweaks<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.769> saying<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.250> II

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
to be a few tweaks but saying that II

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.780 
to be a few tweaks but saying that II
mark<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.209> know<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> gaffer<00:02:42.950> now<00:02:43.950> knows<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
mark you know the gaffer now knows that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
mark you know the gaffer now knows that
what<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.120> had<00:02:45.329> for<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> last<00:02:45.600> few<00:02:45.900> years<00:02:45.959> has

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
what we had for the last few years has

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.020 
what we had for the last few years has
been<00:02:46.440> successful<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.370> more<00:02:47.910> about

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
been successful so it's more about

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.819 
been successful so it's more about
tweaking<00:02:48.420> than<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.810> big<00:02:48.959> overhaul<00:02:49.410> he<00:02:49.620> knows

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
tweaking than a big overhaul he knows

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.650 
tweaking than a big overhaul he knows
where<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> solid<00:02:50.459> well<00:02:50.700> organized<00:02:51.150> team<00:02:51.480> he

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
where a solid well organized team he

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050 
where a solid well organized team he
doesn't<00:02:51.959> want<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.280> dismantle<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:54.000> he

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
doesn't want to dismantle that but he

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
doesn't want to dismantle that but he
wants<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.299> add<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> few<00:02:54.750> bits<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.110> his<00:02:55.230> own<00:02:55.410> which

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
wants to add a few bits of his own which

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.710 
wants to add a few bits of his own which
is<00:02:55.650> normal<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> course<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.790> we'll<00:02:57.269> be<00:02:57.360> working

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
is normal of course and we'll be working

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.390 
is normal of course and we'll be working
hard<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.019> implement<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.590> Bobby<00:02:58.980> Zamora<00:02:59.310> was

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
hard to implement that Bobby Zamora was

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.130 
hard to implement that Bobby Zamora was
a<00:02:59.519> different<00:02:59.820> player<00:03:00.000> last<00:03:00.209> season<00:03:00.329> what<00:03:00.989> did

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
a different player last season what did

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.460 
a different player last season what did
you<00:03:01.170> put<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.530> put<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.739> down<00:03:01.799> too<00:03:03.200> well<00:03:04.200> I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you put you put that down too well I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.690 
you put you put that down too well I
think<00:03:04.620> confidence<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:07.860> huge<00:03:08.250> factor<00:03:08.459> in

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
think confidence is a huge factor in

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.160 
think confidence is a huge factor in
football<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.239> especially<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.720> Bobby<00:03:09.959> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
football and especially with Bobby you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.420 
football and especially with Bobby you
know<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.410> first<00:03:10.620> season<00:03:10.950> was<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.100> little<00:03:11.340> bit

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
know the first season was a little bit

be<00:04:42.229> a<00:04:42.260> huge<00:04:42.620> loss<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.950> lose<00:04:43.280> him<00:04:43.520> if<00:04:43.700> we<00:04:44.180> didn't

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
be a huge loss to lose him if we didn't

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.379 
be a huge loss to lose him if we didn't
replace<00:04:45.860> him<00:04:46.130> if<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.880> we've<00:04:47.210> got<00:04:47.360> a

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
replace him if you like and we've got a

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.820 
replace him if you like and we've got a
great<00:04:47.750> young<00:04:47.960> goalkeeper<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.470> david

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
great young goalkeeper and david

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.279 
great young goalkeeper and david
stockdale<00:04:49.039> lose<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.700> little<00:04:50.570> bit<00:04:50.690> experience

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
stockdale lose a little bit experience

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.010 
stockdale lose a little bit experience
with<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.500> real<00:04:51.979> potential<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.820> but<00:04:53.720> you'd<00:04:53.870> need

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
with a real potential and but you'd need

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.630 
with a real potential and but you'd need
someone<00:04:54.410> in<00:04:54.530> maybe<00:04:54.740> with<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.280> know<00:04:55.310> some

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
someone in maybe with it you know some

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.330 
someone in maybe with it you know some
similar<00:04:56.000> experience<00:04:56.479> to<00:04:56.570> mark<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.140> i<00:04:57.350> don't

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
similar experience to mark so i don't

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.710 
similar experience to mark so i don't
think<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.700> club<00:04:58.910> would<00:04:59.090> let<00:04:59.270> him<00:04:59.390> go<00:04:59.570> without

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
think the club would let him go without

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.050 
think the club would let him go without
replacing<00:05:00.289> him<00:05:00.590> but<00:05:01.550> he's<00:05:01.640> going<00:05:01.789> to<00:05:01.850> be<00:05:01.910> very

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
replacing him but he's going to be very

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.640 
replacing him but he's going to be very
difficult<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.600> replace<00:05:02.870> if<00:05:03.169> he<00:05:03.260> does<00:05:03.440> go

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
difficult to replace if he does go

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.170 
difficult to replace if he does go
because<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.190> fact<00:05:04.400> that<00:05:04.520> he's<00:05:04.789> done<00:05:04.940> so

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
because of the fact that he's done so

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.630 
because of the fact that he's done so
well<00:05:05.390> for<00:05:05.600> us<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.930> did<00:05:06.260> ideally<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.340> know<00:05:07.460> from

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
well for us I did ideally you know from

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.630 
well for us I did ideally you know from
a<00:05:07.700> personal<00:05:07.850> point<00:05:08.180> of<00:05:08.300> view<00:05:08.360> iop<00:05:08.840> stays<00:05:09.080> and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
a personal point of view iop stays and

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.980 
a personal point of view iop stays and
but<00:05:10.640> I<00:05:10.669> understand<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.270> sometimes<00:05:11.510> when<00:05:11.900> the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
but I understand that sometimes when the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.240 
but I understand that sometimes when the
bigger<00:05:12.200> clubs<00:05:12.440> come<00:05:12.680> call<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.160> it's

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
bigger clubs come call and it's

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.520 
bigger clubs come call and it's
difficult<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:14.000> we'll<00:05:14.690> see<00:05:14.810> how<00:05:14.840> that<00:05:14.960> pans<00:05:15.260> out

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
difficult so we'll see how that pans out

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.279 
difficult so we'll see how that pans out
but<00:05:15.860> I'm<00:05:15.950> hopeful<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.600> not<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:18.020> wish

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
but I'm hopeful and and if not I wish

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.710 
but I'm hopeful and and if not I wish
him<00:05:18.440> all<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.590> best<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.160> we<00:05:19.760> know<00:05:20.360> as<00:05:20.600> I<00:05:20.690> said

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
him all the best and we know as I said

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.469 
him all the best and we know as I said
we<00:05:21.050> will<00:05:21.289> need<00:05:21.740> someone<00:05:22.070> into<00:05:22.280> replacing<00:05:22.520> yeah

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479

Billy major Chairman's just come into a

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.330 
Billy major Chairman's just come into a
bit<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:24.919> cash<00:05:25.750> setting<00:05:26.750> his<00:05:26.840> shop<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.289> do<00:05:28.250> you

bit of cash setting his shop I do you

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.980 
bit of cash setting his shop I do you
think<00:05:28.490> he's<00:05:28.640> issued<00:05:29.030> backues<00:05:29.419> with<00:05:29.600> big<00:05:29.750> funds

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
think he's issued backues with big funds

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.080

to<00:05:30.200> push<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.470> club<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.710> next<00:05:30.890> level<00:05:31.160> well<00:05:32.060> I

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
to push the club the next level well I

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.460 
to push the club the next level well I
think<00:05:32.210> it's<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.690> difficult<00:05:32.870> one<00:05:33.200> you<00:05:33.320> know<00:05:33.380> you

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
think it's a difficult one you know you

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.320 
think it's a difficult one you know you
have<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.650> have<00:05:33.950> to<00:05:34.010> be<00:05:34.130> careful<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.910> would<00:05:35.300> you

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
have to have to be careful and would you

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.930 
have to have to be careful and would you
still<00:05:35.600> have<00:05:35.690> debt<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:35.960> think<00:05:36.289> of<00:05:36.440> course<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:36.950> we

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
still have debt I think of course so we

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.850 
still have debt I think of course so we
we<00:05:38.330> have<00:05:38.419> to<00:05:38.539> be<00:05:38.660> careful<00:05:38.840> not<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.380> go<00:05:39.500> over<00:05:39.530> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
we have to be careful not to go over the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.010 
we have to be careful not to go over the
top<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.310> put<00:05:41.060> ourselves<00:05:41.180> in<00:05:41.630> a<00:05:41.720> whole<00:05:41.870> world

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
top and put ourselves in a whole world

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.659 
top and put ourselves in a whole world
of<00:05:42.139> trouble<00:05:42.320> financially<00:05:42.650> for<00:05:43.250> a<00:05:43.310> short-term

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
of trouble financially for a short-term

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.770 
of trouble financially for a short-term
game<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:45.580> it's<00:05:46.580> boring<00:05:47.000> but<00:05:47.030> stability<00:05:47.660> is<00:05:47.750> a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
game and it's boring but stability is a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.450 
game and it's boring but stability is a
word<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.080> we<00:05:48.380> use<00:05:48.410> a<00:05:48.620> lot<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:49.100> know<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.370> have

to keep improving bit by bit rather than

much<00:05:59.780> I<00:05:59.960> don't<00:06:00.139> know<00:06:00.289> but<00:06:00.470> I<00:06:00.560> would<00:06:00.680> imagine<00:06:00.860> he

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
much I don't know but I would imagine he

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.649 
much I don't know but I would imagine he
will<00:06:01.280> give<00:06:01.580> him<00:06:01.699> some<00:06:01.909> money<00:06:02.030> to<00:06:02.240> spend<00:06:02.479> i

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
will give him some money to spend i

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.499 
will give him some money to spend i
think<00:06:02.930> that<00:06:03.699> the<00:06:04.699> Chairman<00:06:05.060> over<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.330> years

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
think that the Chairman over the years

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.119 
think that the Chairman over the years
been<00:06:05.720> very<00:06:05.870> generous<00:06:06.080> in<00:06:06.349> that<00:06:06.530> respect<00:06:06.919> and

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
been very generous in that respect and

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:08.290 
been very generous in that respect and
we'll<00:06:07.280> need<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.580> keep<00:06:07.729> doing<00:06:08.000> that<00:06:08.090> to

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
we'll need to keep doing that to

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.790 
we'll need to keep doing that to
