00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the animals which is what I do all the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
the animals which is what I do all the
time<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.600> feeling<00:00:39.960> well

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
time you know when I'm feeling well

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.119 
time you know when I'm feeling well
I've<00:00:41.399> had<00:00:41.670> times<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.770> get<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> point

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
I've had times where I get to the point

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.479 
I've had times where I get to the point
that<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.090> able<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> function

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
that I'm just I'm not able to function

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.319 
that I'm just I'm not able to function
so<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:49.530> gets<00:00:50.399> into<00:00:50.989> non-stop<00:00:51.989> crying

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
so it it gets into non-stop crying

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.069 
so it it gets into non-stop crying
feeling<00:00:54.410> hopeless<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:57.170> not<00:00:58.170> being<00:00:58.440> able<00:00:58.859> to

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
feeling hopeless and not being able to

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
feeling hopeless and not being able to
be<00:01:01.079> involved<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.859> anything<00:01:02.190> outside<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
be involved with anything outside of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.140 
be involved with anything outside of
home<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.909> think<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:07.100> reclusive

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
home so I think I get pretty reclusive

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
home so I think I get pretty reclusive
too<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> way

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
too and I know that that's not the way

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
too and I know that that's not the way
it<00:01:11.790> should<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.560> that's<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.770> indicator<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it should be so that's an indicator to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
it should be so that's an indicator to
me<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.659> help<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.680> uncommon<00:01:17.220> for

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
me to get help it's not uncommon for

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
me to get help it's not uncommon for

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
to start cloud encompassing me so I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.420 
to start cloud encompassing me so I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.520 
noticed fairly quickly clinical research
seems<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.790> indicate<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.330> many<00:02:49.750> factors<00:02:50.290> like

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
seems to indicate that many factors like

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.440 
seems to indicate that many factors like
a<00:02:50.560> patient's<00:02:51.070> age<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.610> medical<00:02:51.970> conditions

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
like diabetes and body mass index could

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.270 
like diabetes and body mass index could
play<00:02:55.120> roles<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.750> L<00:02:55.900> methylfolate<00:02:56.470> deficiency

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
play roles and L methylfolate deficiency

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.130 
play roles and L methylfolate deficiency
in<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.489> brain<00:02:57.730> which<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.390> turn<00:02:58.420> has<00:02:58.959> been

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
in the brain which in turn has been

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.100 
in the brain which in turn has been
linked<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.470> depression<00:02:59.560> in<00:03:00.220> studies<00:03:00.930> 70%<00:03:01.930> or

linked to depression in studies 70% or

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.290 
linked to depression in studies 70% or
so<00:03:02.290> patients<00:03:02.739> who<00:03:03.489> suffer<00:03:03.910> from<00:03:03.940> depression

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
so patients who suffer from depression

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.780 
so patients who suffer from depression
we<00:03:04.810> believe<00:03:05.230> are<00:03:05.590> missing<00:03:06.400> one<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
we believe are missing one of the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.449 
we believe are missing one of the
enzymes<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:08.019> helps<00:03:08.350> break<00:03:08.620> down<00:03:08.650> folate

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
enzymes that helps break down folate

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.199 
enzymes that helps break down folate
into<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.090> methylated<00:03:10.900> form<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.350> folate<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
into the methylated form of folate and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.789 
into the methylated form of folate and
you<00:03:13.209> can't<00:03:13.540> get<00:03:13.720> folate<00:03:14.170> into<00:03:14.410> your<00:03:14.530> brain

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
you can't get folate into your brain

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.770 
you can't get folate into your brain
unless<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.489> methylated<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.299> won't<00:03:16.450> cross

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
unless it's methylated it won't cross

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.080 
unless it's methylated it won't cross
the<00:03:16.810> blood-brain<00:03:17.470> barrier<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.760> won't<00:03:18.940> do

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
the blood-brain barrier so it won't do

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.420 
the blood-brain barrier so it won't do
your<00:03:19.269> brain<00:03:19.570> any<00:03:19.810> good<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.890> won't<00:03:21.070> help<00:03:21.220> you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
your brain any good it won't help you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.370 
your brain any good it won't help you
make<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.850> neurotransmitters<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.110> you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
make the neurotransmitters that you you

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.949 
make the neurotransmitters that you you
that<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.860> need<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.959> serotonin

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
that you need that is serotonin

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.920 
that you need that is serotonin
norepinephrine<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:27.040> dopamine<00:03:27.750> unless<00:03:28.750> it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
norepinephrine and dopamine unless it

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.500 
norepinephrine and dopamine unless it
can<00:03:29.049> cross<00:03:29.320> into<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.709> blood-brain<00:03:30.220> barrier

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
can cross into the blood-brain barrier

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.729 
can cross into the blood-brain barrier
so<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.370> an<00:03:33.489> exciting<00:03:33.910> idea<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:38.530> help

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
so this is an exciting idea and to help

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.410 
so this is an exciting idea and to help
