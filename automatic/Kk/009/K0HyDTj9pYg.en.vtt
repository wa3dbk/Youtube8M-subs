00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
there but today we're going to go back

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
there but today we're going to go back
to<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.719> under<00:00:40.079> color<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:41.010> under<00:00:41.399> color

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to this one under color now under color

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
to this one under color now under color
you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.750> hue<00:00:43.110> saturation

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you can see I have hue saturation

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 
you can see I have hue saturation
luminance<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.190> each<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.610> color<00:00:44.850> spectrums

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
luminance for each of my color spectrums

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
luminance for each of my color spectrums
now<00:00:46.110> where<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> use<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.670> I'm

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
now where I use this is when I'm

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.279 
now where I use this is when I'm
shooting<00:00:47.940> jewelry<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.660> example<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> lot<00:00:49.260> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
shooting jewelry for example a lot of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
shooting jewelry for example a lot of
times<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.219> different<00:00:50.989> yellows<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
times I will get different yellows and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
times I will get different yellows and
oranges<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.370> reflecting<00:00:53.850> around<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
oranges that are reflecting around the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.639 
oranges that are reflecting around the
room<00:00:54.390> from<00:00:54.690> whether<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> ambient

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
room from whether it be the ambient

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
room from whether it be the ambient
light<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.890> whatever<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.899> what<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> do

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
light or whatever and what I want to do

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.510 
light or whatever and what I want to do
is<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> don't<00:00:58.680> necessarily<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.340> all

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
is I don't necessarily want to get all

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
is I don't necessarily want to get all
the<00:00:59.789> codes<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.149> might<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.480> don't<00:01:00.629> want<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> little

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the codes I might I don't want a little

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
the codes I might I don't want a little
bit<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.289> color<00:01:01.530> reflecting<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.160> diamond

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
bit of color reflecting in the diamond

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.280 
bit of color reflecting in the diamond
but<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> don't<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.539> overwhelming

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
but I don't want that overwhelming

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
but I don't want that overwhelming
orange<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.640> course<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:06.030> people<00:01:06.210> might

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
orange now of course some people might

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.460 
orange now of course some people might
say<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.510> Trevor<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.080> go<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.380> adjust

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
say well Trevor you can go up and adjust

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
say well Trevor you can go up and adjust
your<00:01:07.680> color<00:01:07.979> white<00:01:08.400> balance<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.270> could

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
your color white balance which I could

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
your color white balance which I could
but<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.380> happens<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.890> sometimes<00:01:11.250> you'll<00:01:11.430> get

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
but what happens is sometimes you'll get

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
but what happens is sometimes you'll get
lights<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> things<00:01:12.360> reflecting<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:12.990> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
lights and things reflecting off that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
lights and things reflecting off that
diamond<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
diamond so what I really want to do is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.520 
diamond so what I really want to do is
I'm<00:01:15.509> gonna<00:01:15.600> come<00:01:15.810> over<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.320> color

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I'm gonna come over here to my color

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
I'm gonna come over here to my color
menu<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.460> gonna<00:01:17.549> actually<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.210> take<00:01:18.360> my

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
menu and I'm gonna actually just take my

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.609 
menu and I'm gonna actually just take my
yellows<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.110> I'm<00:01:19.200> gonna<00:01:19.320> pull<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
yellows and I'm gonna pull the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
yellows and I'm gonna pull the
saturation<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.700> you'll<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
saturation down now you'll see when I do

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
saturation down now you'll see when I do
that<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.020> still<00:01:22.439> maintain<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> blues

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that I still maintain some of the blues

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609

really saturate or I even want to darken
those<00:02:00.540> blues<00:02:00.840> well<00:02:01.740> instead<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.520> into

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
those blues well instead of going into

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.660 
those blues well instead of going into
exposure<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.990> trying<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> pull<00:02:04.649> those<00:02:04.829> blues

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
exposure and trying to pull those blues

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.670 
exposure and trying to pull those blues
down<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.390> maybe<00:02:06.570> creating<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.049> radial<00:02:07.439> filter

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
down or maybe creating a radial filter

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
what I can do is I can just come over to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.640 
what I can do is I can just come over to
my<00:02:12.629> color<00:02:12.840> menu

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
my color menu

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.880 
my color menu
I<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.459> down<00:02:14.579> to<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:14.730> blues<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:16.349> can<00:02:16.530> do

I can go down to my blues and I can do
one<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.129> two<00:02:17.220> things<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.760> bring<00:02:17.849> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
one of two things I can bring the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.460 
one of two things I can bring the
luminance<00:02:18.390> down<00:02:18.599> which<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.930> basically<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
luminance down which is basically the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.199 
luminance down which is basically the
how<00:02:19.709> light<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.189> are<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:20.939> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.060> see

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
how light they are so there you can see

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.729 
how light they are so there you can see
automatically<00:02:22.079> I'm<00:02:22.170> starting<00:02:22.439> to<00:02:22.470> pull<00:02:22.650> back

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
automatically I'm starting to pull back

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.899 
automatically I'm starting to pull back
those<00:02:22.980> blues<00:02:23.220> now<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:23.579> want<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.819> look

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
those blues now I don't want it to look

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.119 
those blues now I don't want it to look
fake<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.390> course<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:24.930> let's<00:02:25.829> just<00:02:25.950> bring<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
fake of course but let's just bring that

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.559 
fake of course but let's just bring that
back<00:02:26.400> by<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> way<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:27.000> want<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.329> zero

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
back by the way if you want to just zero

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.240 
back by the way if you want to just zero
those<00:02:27.780> out<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.170> click<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> name<00:02:28.650> or<00:02:29.220> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
those out just click on the name or I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.399 
those out just click on the name or I
could<00:02:29.579> even<00:02:29.610> bring<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.000> saturation<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.379> I

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
could even bring the saturation up so I

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.660 
could even bring the saturation up so I
can<00:02:31.530> kind<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.739> bring<00:02:31.859> those<00:02:31.980> saturation<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.519> can

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
can kind of bring those saturation I can

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.819 
can kind of bring those saturation I can
do<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> combination<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.450> bull<00:02:33.659> now<00:02:34.409> if<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.590> really

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
do a combination of bull now if I really

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.050 
do a combination of bull now if I really
want<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.099> crazy<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.640> even<00:02:35.790> change<00:02:35.939> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
want to get crazy I can even change the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.360 
want to get crazy I can even change the
color<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.569> guy<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.439> can<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.859> now<00:02:38.099> again

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
color of this guy you can see now again

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.740 
color of this guy you can see now again
there<00:02:38.489> would<00:02:38.549> be<00:02:38.609> no<00:02:38.760> purpose<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.299> doing<00:02:39.599> that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
there would be no purpose in doing that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.599 
there would be no purpose in doing that
but<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.439> see<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.829> power<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.519> these

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
but you can see the power and these

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.550 
but you can see the power and these
little<00:02:41.849> color<00:02:42.060> sliders<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.930> let<00:02:43.109> me<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.290> zero

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
all kind of wacky if I just want a zero

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.399 
all kind of wacky if I just want a zero
amount<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.280> hold<00:02:50.459> down<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:51.170> option<00:02:52.170> key<00:02:52.200> or

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
amount if I hold down the option key or

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.470 
amount if I hold down the option key or
control<00:02:52.859> key<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.159> PC<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.329> get

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
control key on the PC I can then get

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.949 
control key on the PC I can then get
where<00:02:55.109> it<00:02:55.170> says<00:02:55.319> reset<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.750> again<00:02:57.750> let's<00:02:57.930> just

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
where it says reset so again let's just

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.210 
where it says reset so again let's just
pick<00:02:58.170> something<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.439> looks<00:02:58.620> kind<00:02:58.829> of<00:02:58.859> decent

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
there we go the color slider in a mere

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.839 
there we go the color slider in a mere

saturated green same thing I can bring
down<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.190> saturation<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.879> can<00:03:30.030> bring<00:03:30.150> up<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
down the saturation I can bring up the

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.569 
down the saturation I can bring up the
saturation<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.169> can<00:03:31.500> even<00:03:31.709> change<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.280> gloom

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
saturation I can even change the gloom

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.920 
saturation I can even change the gloom
in<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.090> make<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.239> darker<00:03:33.510> greens

which<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.650> course<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:34.919> want<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.159> go<00:03:35.250> too<00:03:35.310> much

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
which of course we want to go too much

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.670 
which of course we want to go too much
but<00:03:35.849> or<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.209> go<00:03:36.269> lighter<00:03:36.480> greens<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.620> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
but or I can go lighter greens so you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.199 
but or I can go lighter greens so you
see<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:37.980> power<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.430> those<00:03:38.609> sliders<00:03:38.879> let's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
see the power of those sliders let's

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.970 
see the power of those sliders let's
just<00:03:39.359> do<00:03:39.449> it<00:03:39.540> one<00:03:39.629> more<00:03:39.690> time<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:40.139> same<00:03:40.739> thing

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
then maybe I'll just bring up the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.039 
then maybe I'll just bring up the
saturation<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.669> little<00:03:44.699> bit<00:03:45.060> I'll<00:03:45.840> bring<00:03:45.959> up

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
saturation a little bit I'll bring up

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.500 
saturation a little bit I'll bring up
the<00:03:46.199> luminance<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.829> bit<00:03:46.949> and<00:03:47.879> lastly

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the luminance a little bit and lastly

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.939 
the luminance a little bit and lastly
let's<00:03:48.599> just<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.109> one<00:03:49.260> more<00:03:49.319> time<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.799> one

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
let's just do it one more time this one

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.530 
let's just do it one more time this one
you<00:03:50.040> can<00:03:50.159> really<00:03:50.519> see<00:03:50.669> we<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.879> those<00:03:51.060> yellow

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
you can really see we got those yellow

you can really see we got those yellow
so<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.750> get<00:03:52.229> those<00:03:52.409> you<00:03:52.620> know<00:03:52.829> real<00:03:53.250> bright

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
so you get those you know real bright

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.580 
so you get those you know real bright
yellows<00:03:53.819> in<00:03:53.970> those<00:03:54.090> screens<00:03:54.479> let's<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.440> take

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
yellows in those screens let's just take

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.110 
yellows in those screens let's just take
those<00:03:55.739> greens<00:03:56.010> over<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.340> little<00:03:56.430> bit<00:03:56.639> let's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
those greens over a little bit let's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.000 
those greens over a little bit let's
actually<00:03:57.269> take<00:03:57.479> my<00:03:57.629> yellows<00:03:58.019> change<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.769> hue

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
actually take my yellows change that hue

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.640 
actually take my yellows change that hue
just<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.280> tiny<00:03:59.489> bit<00:03:59.729> okay<00:04:00.449> and<00:04:00.870> maybe<00:04:01.440> we<00:04:01.590> want

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
just a tiny bit okay and maybe we want

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.990 
just a tiny bit okay and maybe we want
to<00:04:01.769> be<00:04:01.889> saturated<00:04:02.310> those<00:04:02.430> yellows<00:04:02.729> just<00:04:02.909> a

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
to be saturated those yellows just a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.149 
to be saturated those yellows just a
little<00:04:03.209> bit<00:04:03.299> as<00:04:03.389> well<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.620> again<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.979> can<00:04:05.099> see
