00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 your problem is space and his 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.950
 this service is for you systems in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.110
 Wall Satin offers solutions filomuro 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.869
 flush with the wall to enhance the space 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.110
 as containers and pocket doors e 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.939
 wall compartments to make functional and 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:35.519
 make the most of small environments 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:37.140
 or large of our homes whether it be 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.300
 of small or large apartments 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 size there is no doubt that space 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 it has become more than a trend one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 need of our day 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 here then are solutions that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 rationalize create or even 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 embellish the space in the wall in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 masonry or plasterboard barney a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.489
 disappearance or doors covering panels 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 sliding or motorized the important thing is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 that our systems are satin walls 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.700
 motto our trend and make it appear 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.899
 only space and with this system 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.509
 we only have a glimpse of the 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.899
 speech of internal space because one 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.880
 when closed you see that it disappears 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.880
 completely inside the wall 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 this means that we do not only do it 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.729
 we say scenographically solutions 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 as difficult as these make us understand 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 how flexible we are however important 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.860
 we make any kind of size in 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.860
 this case we did not deal with 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.070
 only even enclosed spaces are flush 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.880
 wall but also to go and supply gods 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.460
 prefabricated pre-assembled modules 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.000
 to get to do perfectly the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.630
 solutions always go to day though with 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 the characteristic that then in work are 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.470
 so easy to finish because they are 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.100
 already provided for the executive solutions of the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100
 building site 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.549
 for example our nothing if to one 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.680
 solution from April high a system 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.499
 day to do or even one 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.379
 basic solution the most comfortable thing was 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.799
 realize what a drawer 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.810
 in this case an engine was installed 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.170
 electronic that allows an ease of 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:48.629
 opening and look at an ease of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:51.569
 closing what is there to say that we 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.120
 we don't just make closures with 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.389
 inner container but we also do 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.280
 closures where we have only the 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.500
 our system that has a system 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.099
 aluminum that came completely 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.459
 recessed flush indifferently into the 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.010
 plasterboard masonry wall and with 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.030
 these closures make equipment for 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.419
 laundry closet wardrobe or 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.340
 even create solutions where 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.340
 I'm going to shut down plants 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.530
 our door-door solutions a 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.320
 disappearance are solutions that have a thousand 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.290
 possibility of use as you see with 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.480
 this example we make a door here 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.780
 which then becomes a big one 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.360
 mirror and with our own system of 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.770
 then we can open it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.710
 without a very important thing to have the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.740
 handle from the outside so that 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.260
 this is a great mirror that yes 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.750
 confuses if necessary becomes a 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.520
 closet becomes a clothes hanger a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.520
 1,000 destinations and lights 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.030
 other very important solutions is that 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.390
 we can make walls 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.889
 completely in crystal in the absence of 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.989
 visible profiles and to do indifferently 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.380
 fixed parts the opening parts and part 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.080
 sliding doors always inserted in the same 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.419
 system also wine there are problems of 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.330
 dimensions can be everything 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.540
 perfectly embedded within the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.860
 ceiling and perfectly recessed 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.860
 inside the wall 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.800
 our solutions have a requirement 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.200
 fundamental indifferently yes 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.900
 can put in the structure in 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.450
 masonry and in the plasterboard wall 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.180
 there are no size problems 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.520
 wall because we have so much a system 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.790
 of adapters that always give the product 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.740
 finished and always the product in the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.950
 maximum perfection because we want 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.470
 eliminate during assembly all 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.600
 those problems that could arise 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.150
 going to improvise and do some 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.300
 finishes would become difficult to 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.300
 handle
