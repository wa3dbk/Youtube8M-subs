okay<00:00:00.780> b11<00:00:01.020> problem<00:00:01.680> number<00:00:01.800> eight<00:00:02.129> directions

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay b11 problem number eight directions

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay b11 problem number eight directions
are<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.030> perform<00:00:03.510> an<00:00:03.840> indicated<00:00:04.230> operation

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
are to perform an indicated operation

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.400 
are to perform an indicated operation
and<00:00:05.220> then<00:00:06.150> they<00:00:06.330> write<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.750> answer<00:00:07.290> in

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
and then they write the answer in

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.589 
and then they write the answer in
scientific<00:00:07.589> notation<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
scientific notation so here the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.220 
scientific notation so here the
operation<00:00:10.530> here<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.880> multiply<00:00:12.450> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
operation here is to multiply this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.650 
operation here is to multiply this
number<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:14.130> scientific<00:00:14.309> notation<00:00:14.700> times<00:00:15.420> this

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
number in scientific notation times this

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
number in scientific notation times this
number<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.080> scientific<00:00:16.260> notation

number in scientific notation

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400 
number in scientific notation
okay<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.060> we'll<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> way<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.570> handle<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
okay so we'll the way we handle that is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.599 
okay so we'll the way we handle that is
we're<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> multiply<00:00:19.800> these<00:00:20.400> two

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
we're going to multiply these two

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 
we're going to multiply these two
numbers<00:00:21.029> first<00:00:21.330> they're<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> multiply

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
numbers first they're going to multiply

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.290 
numbers first they're going to multiply
up<00:00:22.859> our<00:00:23.100> content<00:00:23.550> that's<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> easiest<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
up our content that's the easiest way to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.550 
up our content that's the easiest way to
handle<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.840> okay

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
handle this okay

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
handle this okay
and<00:00:26.460> then<00:00:26.580> we'll<00:00:26.670> go<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and then we'll go from there so the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.439 
and then we'll go from there so the
product<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.710> these<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.519> numbers<00:00:29.789> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
product of these two numbers in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.959 
product of these two numbers in
scientific<00:00:30.630> notation<00:00:31.130> eight<00:00:32.130> point<00:00:32.550> six<00:00:32.730> five

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
scientific notation eight point six five

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.610 
scientific notation eight point six five
times<00:00:33.300> five<00:00:33.510> point<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:33.989> three<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.649> forty<00:00:35.070> five

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
times five point two three is forty five

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.240

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
point two three nine five okay and then

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.529 
point two three nine five okay and then
the<00:00:44.969> power<00:00:45.570> ten<00:00:46.700> would<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.149> remember

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the power ten would be if I remember

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
the power ten would be if I remember
from<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.750> exponents<00:00:49.410> chapter<00:00:49.800> ten<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> six

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
from my exponents chapter ten to the six

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
from my exponents chapter ten to the six
times<00:00:50.760> ten<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> twelfth<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:52.170> add<00:00:52.289> those

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
times ten to the twelfth I can add those

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.549 
times ten to the twelfth I can add those
exponents<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> same<00:00:53.430> base<00:00:53.670> there<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
exponents to the same base there and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.689 
exponents to the same base there and
they<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> attended<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> eighteenth<00:00:56.699> okay<00:00:57.620> so

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
they get attended the eighteenth okay so

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
they get attended the eighteenth okay so
I'm<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.760> done<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> did<00:01:00.600> multiply<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.829> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I'm not done that I did multiply but if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.229 
I'm not done that I did multiply but if
you<00:01:02.039> read<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.219> directions<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.940> say<00:01:03.120> the

notation four point five two three nine
five<00:01:39.299> times<00:01:39.570> ten<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.930> first<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.549> 45

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
five times ten to the first it is 45

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
same base four point five times ten is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
same base four point five times ten is
first<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.280> 4.5<00:01:44.880> plus<00:01:44.970> ten<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:48.409> I'm

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
first right 4.5 plus ten and now I'm

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
first right 4.5 plus ten and now I'm
going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> multiply<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> other<00:01:50.610> power<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
going to multiply by the other power of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.610 
going to multiply by the other power of
10<00:01:51.420> guys<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.009> adjusting

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.160 

so<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.740> 10<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> first<00:01:59.370> client<00:01:59.790> entity<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
so the 10 is the first client entity the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
so the 10 is the first client entity the
10<00:02:01.440> nine<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.250> okay<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.450> in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
10 nine and now I'm okay so this is in

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.900 
10 nine and now I'm okay so this is in
scientific<00:02:03.930> notation<00:02:04.290> between<00:02:05.040> 1<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.400> 10<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
scientific notation between 1 and 10 and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
convenient teeth such a benign okay so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.490 
convenient teeth such a benign okay so

ten to the team and I did a little
adjustment<00:02:20.670> which<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> add<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.960> to

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080

look out that sometimes with these

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
look out that sometimes with these
problems<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.910> multiply<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.780> your<00:02:31.170> number

problems you multiply and your number
will<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.890> they<00:02:32.550> won't<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:32.970> scientific

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
will be they won't be in scientific

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.850 
will be they won't be in scientific
notation<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:34.050> someone<00:02:34.350> will<00:02:34.470> either<00:02:34.530> be

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
notation is someone will either be

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.380 
notation is someone will either be
greater<00:02:35.160> than<00:02:35.310> 10<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.580> less<00:02:35.700> than<00:02:35.940> ten<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
greater than 10 or less than ten and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.420 
greater than 10 or less than ten and
there's<00:02:36.960> another<00:02:37.170> step<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.100> in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
there's another step you have to do in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.650 
there's another step you have to do in
order<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.760> put<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.210> scientific<00:02:39.450> notation

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
order to put it in scientific notation

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.410 
order to put it in scientific notation
other<00:02:40.260> time<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.070> get<00:02:41.220> lucky<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.880> time<00:02:42.180> that

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
other time you get lucky that time that

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.300 
other time you get lucky that time that
would<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.660> less<00:02:42.870> than<00:02:43.050> ten<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.590> greater<00:02:44.250> than

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
would be less than ten and greater than

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.160 
would be less than ten and greater than
one<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.610> you'll<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.060> done<00:02:45.270> there<00:02:45.570> okay<00:02:46.110> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
one and you'll be done there okay so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.750 
one and you'll be done there okay so
make<00:02:46.470> sure<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.070> all<00:02:47.460> right<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
make sure you look that all right that

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.430 
make sure you look that all right that
