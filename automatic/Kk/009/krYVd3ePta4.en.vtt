00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
test very heavy less and big TV air bags

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.099 
test very heavy less and big TV air bags
most<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> time<00:00:59.729> with<00:00:59.879> big<00:01:00.030> stringers<00:01:00.389> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
most of the time with big stringers and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.509 
most of the time with big stringers and
of<00:01:01.199> course<00:01:01.409> because<00:01:01.679> of<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.889> many<00:01:02.129> people<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
of course because of that many people is

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.969 
of course because of that many people is
using<00:01:03.239> spod<00:01:03.510> rod<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.710> we've<00:01:04.949> been

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
using spod rod you see we've been

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.789 
using spod rod you see we've been
casting<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.579> 300-350

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
casting with 300-350

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.450 
casting with 300-350
grass<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.159> big<00:01:08.579> PVA<00:01:09.030> bags<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.570> big<00:01:09.780> stringers

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
grass and big PVA bags or big stringers

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.179 
grass and big PVA bags or big stringers
so<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.700> spot<00:01:12.210> rod<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.840> easily<00:01:13.229> manage<00:01:13.649> to<00:01:13.979> cast

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so a spot rod can easily manage to cast

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
so a spot rod can easily manage to cast
it<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.539> when<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> fight<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it but but then when you fight in the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.179 
it but but then when you fight in the
fish<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.579> know<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.880> spotter<00:01:18.210> will<00:01:18.450> feel<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.719> bit

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
fish you know a spotter will feel a bit

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.940 
fish you know a spotter will feel a bit
also<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> spod<00:01:21.750> rod<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
also the spod rod is not really a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
also the spod rod is not really a
recommended<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.030> most<00:01:24.329> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> time<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
recommended because most of the time you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.319 
recommended because most of the time you
find<00:01:24.990> quite<00:01:25.920> short<00:01:26.219> distance<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.789> really

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
find quite short distance with really

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.300 
find quite short distance with really

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
actually the old blank of this tree

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.429 
actually the old blank of this tree
model<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:41.909> only<00:01:42.060> 42<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.659> carbon<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.350> then

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
model is is only 42 on carbon and then

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.130 
model is is only 42 on carbon and then
we<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> very<00:01:44.039> long<00:01:44.340> section<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> 3k<00:01:45.810> woven

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we have a very long section of 3k woven

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
we have a very long section of 3k woven
carbon<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.679> in<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> body<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.520> stepping

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
carbon here in the body so just stepping

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.560 
carbon here in the body so just stepping
out<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> yeah

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
out of it yeah

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.080 
out of it yeah
and<00:01:48.899> another<00:01:49.530> key<00:01:50.189> point<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.609> think<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and another key point I think of this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
and another key point I think of this
rod<00:01:51.299> yeah<00:01:51.810> you've<00:01:52.500> been<00:01:52.530> testing<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.219> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
rod yeah you've been testing it for a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
rod yeah you've been testing it for a
week<00:01:53.520> almost<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.030> yeah<00:01:54.299> even<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> need

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
just because this rod is made to fish

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.160 
just because this rod is made to fish
from<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.950> boat<00:03:35.070> or<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:36.090> very<00:03:36.420> tight<00:03:36.750> swimming

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
from the boat or in very tight swimming

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.050 
from the boat or in very tight swimming
so<00:03:37.710> normally<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.190> don't<00:03:38.610> need<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
so normally you don't need to have a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.330 
so normally you don't need to have a
long<00:03:39.330> handle<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.750> cast<00:03:39.990> these<00:03:40.470> rods<00:03:40.800> just<00:03:41.100> need

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
long handle to cast these rods just need

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.370 
long handle to cast these rods just need
to<00:03:41.460> be<00:03:41.580> easy<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.540> handle<00:03:42.750> yeah

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
to be easy to handle yeah

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.650 
to be easy to handle yeah
because<00:03:43.770> if<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.250> don't<00:03:44.730> stick<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.210> behind<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
because if you don't stick it behind you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.480 
because if you don't stick it behind you
in<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> wide<00:03:46.050> area<00:03:46.280> exactly<00:03:47.280> aren't<00:03:47.430> you

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
in the wide area exactly aren't you

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.360 
in the wide area exactly aren't you
about<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.540> normal<00:03:49.140> handle<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.620> 50<00:03:49.980> centimeter

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
about the normal handle is 50 centimeter

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.560 
about the normal handle is 50 centimeter
longer<00:03:50.580> than<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.240> can<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.450> imagine

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
longer than this so can you imagine

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.600 
longer than this so can you imagine
fishing<00:03:52.170> from<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.320> boat<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.250> very<00:03:53.430> tight

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
fishing from the boat or in a very tight

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.580 
fishing from the boat or in a very tight
swim<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.030> having<00:03:54.330> such<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.630> long<00:03:54.810> handle<00:03:55.170> could

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
swim and having such a long handle could

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190 
swim and having such a long handle could
be<00:03:55.710> a<00:03:55.740> nightmare<00:03:56.100> now<00:03:56.460> has<00:03:56.700> been<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.810> new<00:03:58.020> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
be a nightmare now has been all new to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.740 
be a nightmare now has been all new to
me<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.350> boat<00:03:58.620> fishing<00:03:59.330> but<00:04:00.330> I've<00:04:00.450> probably

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
me this boat fishing but I've probably

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.850 
me this boat fishing but I've probably
enjoyed<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.470> has<00:04:01.590> been<00:04:01.800> really<00:04:02.190> exciting

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.920
