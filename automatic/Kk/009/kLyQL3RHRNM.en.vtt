00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello everyone my name will be very 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.349
 many likes komentov where they ask me 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.690
 tell about my settings 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.519
 I would not say that the settings were 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 are made 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 consciously many they stand at random because 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.600
 how much to brag there especially 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.380
 nothing but if you so want something 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.869
 get get sign here well 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.849
 control here, I think except 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 mouse sensitivity special look 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 no matter how i choose 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.129
 mouse sensitivity I already give you 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 told the gameplay here too 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.649
 the main interesting thing is network 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.270
 anti-aliasing which is all but not exactly 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.780
 everyone is interested in many 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.649
 I also made as BF3 I 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.070
 although I managed to play from 50 set and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.199
 100 and in my opinion nothing changes in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 face-to-face meeting plan 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 because of which i am suffering that is running out 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.339
 from the corner the opponent doesn't care me 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.350
 kills even ready to shoot such 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.720
 happens here a much part 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.760
 more often than in bf3 sound I think too 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.250
 comment does not make much sense 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.850
 and the main thing that interests so many 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.229
 these are the graphics settings on my 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 low i play at minimum settings 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 I only have the maximum quality of textures 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.700
 because the graphics card pulls perfectly 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 without straining this quality textures and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.450
 the quality of the lighting here is called 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:43.950
 This is usually the quality of the shadows in other games. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.549
 specifically in bf3 in bf4 from this but in bf3 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.189
 exactly 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.860
 depended on how much the ribbit shadow 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 under the tree on the cards with large 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 the number of enemy trees with 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.630
 low shadows could be seen much worse 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.869
 than with high that's precisely because of this 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.549
 here the quality of lighting is raised 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.189
 everything else is low because 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.020
 she does not bother me at all and even 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.759
 often helps 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 the world is there in my quality of relief and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.050
 mesh quality affects how much 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.120
 It is far visible some objects and many 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.760
 from objects become invisible on 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.239
 long range and enemy model 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.180
 she is still visible and that is far away 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.799
 I can see some new running 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.110
 opponents though they actually 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.720
 are for me for shelter but it 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.030
 so mini cheat small field of view 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.519
 i am 90 because i'm so used i know 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.239
 that jack plays 70 someone plays and 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.480
 more but more I could not relearn 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.980
 I need laziness less I don’t make sense 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.640
 I see here something like this and binding 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.170
 buttons if someone is interested in setting up 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.569
 also like me but mercy I ask 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.569
 I will show you especially I will not comment 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.829
 I can only say that once I 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.319
 retrained to run on viola he's on me 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.459
 alpha because that way i 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.560
 I save on my fingers and I have a whole 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.109
 little finger there to switch between 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.069
 supine sitting position 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.069
 cards and everything else 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.600
 I have a defibrillator on Ix and in fact 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.910
 Deal most players defibrillator 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.359
 hangs up on that key on gadget 1 and 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.819
 when I pick someone else's whale then where are I 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.579
 Phipps first aid kit confused and put 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.849
 on the contrary, I, alas, cannot for some reason 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.410
 checkout poured 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.489
 developers and if here these keys 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.919
 swap 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.690
 then the defibrillator stops working 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:04:00.150
 any kind of weird thing 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.000
 want to make a video with this jamb later 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.400
 but he seems to me a big attention 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.439
 unworthy to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.870
 the whole video is just a fact 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.870
 I could not change 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.859
 switch the main weapon is the keys 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.190
 but often used transition to 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.720
 the gun by the way became slower 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:29.870
 now it's even more dying when 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.210
 trying to recharge switching to 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.770
 undergun for example until I here 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.440
 I didn't even know what I had 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.810
 I have a key, I do not use a subbarrel 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.330
 and trunks 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.419
 Well, in principle, all full map yet 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.930
 the key is / which is mine 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.690
 between the z key and shifta me 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.210
 a short shift there is a complete map 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.530
 is if someone does not know what it is 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.190
 this is it and the degree of transparency 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.650
 changing but hardly possible 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.560
 do not play that is if earlier I am in the corner 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.960
 I could open the map and somehow with it 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.660
 walk straight with the included then now you 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.160
 This card does not rotate together at first. 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.840
 with the rotation of my head secondly she 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.639
 covers my sight if i do it 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.139
 transparent so i can see what's in there 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.400
 sight, respectively, but I do not see 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.210
 card 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.430
 something like this, I think I told you everything 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.310
 in a technique in a helicopter plane and 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:38.520
 Observer I did not set these respects 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:41.180
 options because I almost never use but 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.400
 maybe by the way they are tuned I 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.009
 pedantic dude in this plan and rather 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.479
 total yes acceleration on viola is slow and 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.910
 yes everything is set up here but I almost don’t 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.630
 I travel in technology and in an airplane and therefore I 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.320
 the thread settings are almost not needed here 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.320
 and all subscribe comment 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.320
 is happy
