00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
okay and you see how it just makes it a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.840 
okay and you see how it just makes it a
little<00:02:17.600> thinner<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:18.739> not<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.100> water<00:02:19.580> but

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
little thinner it's not like water but

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.240 
little thinner it's not like water but
it's<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.120> little<00:02:20.360> bit<00:02:20.510> better<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:21.830> easier<00:02:22.220> for

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
it's a little bit better it's easier for

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.430 
it's a little bit better it's easier for
me<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.489> whisk<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.910> there<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.270> go<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
me to whisk it there you go that's the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.100 
me to whisk it there you go that's the
idea<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.239> you're<00:02:26.390> gonna<00:02:26.570> whisk<00:02:26.900> it
