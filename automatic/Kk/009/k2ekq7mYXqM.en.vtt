well for a long time scientists and many

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.610 
well for a long time scientists and many
people<00:00:03.300> have<00:00:03.480> been<00:00:03.659> interested<00:00:04.140> in<00:00:04.230> what

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
people have been interested in what

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.710 
people have been interested in what
environment<00:00:04.980> did<00:00:05.430> early<00:00:05.730> humans<00:00:05.759> evolved

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
environment did early humans evolved

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.750 
environment did early humans evolved
where<00:00:07.170> did<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.440> originate<00:00:07.950> was<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
where did we originate was at the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.150 
where did we originate was at the
African<00:00:09.450> savannah<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.139> grassland<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
African savannah the grassland or the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.089 
African savannah the grassland or the
ice<00:00:11.519> age<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.090> Europe<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> went<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> East

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
ice age of Europe and so I went to East

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.189 
ice age of Europe and so I went to East
Africa<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> Great<00:00:15.059> Rift<00:00:15.269> Valley<00:00:15.570> to

Africa to the Great Rift Valley to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.630 
Africa to the Great Rift Valley to
understand<00:00:16.859> something<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
understand something about the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.840 
understand something about the
environments<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.510> early<00:00:19.350> humans<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.949> kept

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
environments of early humans I kept

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.519 
environments of early humans I kept
walking<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.510> down<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.869> eroded<00:00:22.230> gullies

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
walking up and down the eroded gullies

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
walking up and down the eroded gullies
and<00:00:22.949> hillside<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.670> seeing<00:00:24.000> layer<00:00:24.300> after

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and hillside and seeing layer after

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.349 
and hillside and seeing layer after
layer<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.310> layer<00:00:26.550> maybe<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.150> lake

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
layer and at one layer maybe the lake

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.570 
layer and at one layer maybe the lake
was<00:00:27.599> present<00:00:28.080> another<00:00:28.529> layer<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.160> lake<00:00:29.340> was

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
was present another layer the lake was

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.429 
was present another layer the lake was
gone<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> drought<00:00:30.630> another<00:00:31.170> layer

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
gone there was a drought another layer

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.130 
gone there was a drought another layer
there<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> forest<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> woodland<00:00:33.719> another

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there is a forest or a woodland another

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
there is a forest or a woodland another
layer<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> grassland<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> kept<00:00:35.670> thinking

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
layer a grassland and I kept thinking

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760 
layer a grassland and I kept thinking
maybe<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.719> wasn't<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.410> environment

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
maybe it wasn't just one environment

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.490 
maybe it wasn't just one environment
where<00:00:38.280> early<00:00:38.550> humans<00:00:38.969> evolved<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.020> rather<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
where early humans evolved but rather it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
where early humans evolved but rather it
was<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.950> change<00:00:41.579> ability<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> ability

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
was the change ability that the ability

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
was the change ability that the ability
of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> environment<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.520> change<00:00:44.879> back<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
of the environment to change back and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
of the environment to change back and
forth<00:00:45.660> between<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.440> another<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.370> was

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
forth between one and another that was

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
forth between one and another that was
the<00:00:47.730> key<00:00:47.969> ingredient<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:49.079> humans<00:00:49.559> evolved

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the key ingredient in how humans evolved

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.970 
the key ingredient in how humans evolved
and<00:00:50.190> how<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:50.370> became<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.590> adaptable<00:00:52.590> able<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and how he became so adaptable able to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880 
and how he became so adaptable able to
live<00:00:53.160> anywhere<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.699> Earth<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.289> if<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.500> idea

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
live anywhere on Earth so if this idea

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
live anywhere on Earth so if this idea
was<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.370> then<00:00:56.940> early<00:00:57.539> humans<00:00:58.050> our

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
was right then early humans our

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.799 
was right then early humans our
ancestors<00:00:58.949> should<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.510> associated<00:01:00.510> mainly

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
ancestors should be associated mainly

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.070 
ancestors should be associated mainly
with<00:01:01.670> places<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.789> earth<00:01:02.820> where<00:01:03.329> environments

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
with places on earth where environments

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
with places on earth where environments
changed<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> went<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> part<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
changed and so I went to that part of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
changed and so I went to that part of
the<00:01:06.270> world<00:01:06.479> South<00:01:07.020> China<00:01:07.470> where<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.100> was

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the world South China where there was

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
the world South China where there was
the<00:01:08.400> reputation<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.450> unchanging

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the reputation for an unchanging

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.830 
the reputation for an unchanging
environment<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> place<00:01:10.979> where<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.610> was

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
environment a place where there was

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
environment a place where there was
environmental<00:01:12.840> stability<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.409> forest<00:01:14.220> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
environmental stability a forest that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.450 
environmental stability a forest that
existed<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> million<00:01:15.900> years<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.100> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
existed for a million years and so I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
existed for a million years and so I
already<00:01:17.970> knew<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.750> Chinese<00:01:19.470> scientists<00:01:20.009> had

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
already knew that Chinese scientists had

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280 
already knew that Chinese scientists had
found<00:01:20.280> stone<00:01:20.640> tools<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.869> what<00:01:22.140> were

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
found stone tools there so what were

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.140 
found stone tools there so what were
securely<00:01:22.890> humans<00:01:23.430> doing<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
securely humans doing there if the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
securely humans doing there if the
environment<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:24.900> stable<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> went

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
environment was so stable so I went

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.880 
environment was so stable so I went
there<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.970> dug<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.080> Chinese<00:01:28.380> colleagues

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
there and dug with my Chinese colleagues

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.520 
there and dug with my Chinese colleagues
and<00:01:29.369> indeed<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.630> found<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> ground

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and indeed what we found in the ground

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
and indeed what we found in the ground
were<00:01:31.829> stone<00:01:32.250> tools<00:01:32.579> indicating<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> early

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
were stone tools indicating the early

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.280 
were stone tools indicating the early
humans<00:01:34.259> were<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.970> layer<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.869> found

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
humans were there in that layer we found

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.069 
humans were there in that layer we found
these<00:01:37.829> also<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.939> these<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.930> known

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
these also and these are what are known

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.560 
these also and these are what are known

were<00:01:54.390> spread<00:01:54.750> all<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
were spread all the way from out of this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.420 
were spread all the way from out of this
explosion<00:01:57.149> from<00:01:57.439> australia<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:59.100> southern

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
explosion from australia to to southern

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.539 
explosion from australia to to southern
china<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> these<00:02:00.899> hot<00:02:01.530> objects<00:02:02.040> burned<00:02:02.340> down

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
china and these hot objects burned down

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
china and these hot objects burned down
the<00:02:02.759> forests<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the forests and so what we think then is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.580 
the forests and so what we think then is
that<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> early<00:02:06.119> humans<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.899> makers<00:02:07.380> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that the early humans the makers of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.859 
that the early humans the makers of
these<00:02:07.680> stone<00:02:08.039> tools<00:02:08.429> were<00:02:08.759> able<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.509> come

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
these stone tools were able to come

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
these stone tools were able to come
across<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.410> landscape<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.039> take<00:02:11.400> advantage

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
across that landscape and take advantage

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.630 
across that landscape and take advantage
of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.720> animals<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> had<00:02:13.620> died

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
of the animals that had died

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880 
of the animals that had died
perhaps<00:02:15.090> some<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.900> burned<00:02:16.230> meat<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
perhaps some of the the burned meat and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.280 
perhaps some of the the burned meat and
and<00:02:17.099> burned<00:02:17.700> burned<00:02:18.329> plants<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.989> they<00:02:19.109> could

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and burned burned plants that they could

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.559 
and burned burned plants that they could
eat<00:02:19.439> it's<00:02:19.590> almost<00:02:19.829> like<00:02:20.040> cooking<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.639> that

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
eat it's almost like cooking and that

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.110 
eat it's almost like cooking and that
they<00:02:21.719> were<00:02:21.840> able<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.200> survive<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:23.120> landscape

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
they were able to survive a landscape

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.970 
they were able to survive a landscape
that<00:02:24.150> had<00:02:24.420> been<00:02:24.569> completely<00:02:25.049> devastated<00:02:25.859> and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that had been completely devastated and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.670 
that had been completely devastated and
they<00:02:26.549> were<00:02:26.609> indeed<00:02:27.120> creatures<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.200> change

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
they were indeed creatures of change

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.119 
they were indeed creatures of change
that<00:02:29.219> they<00:02:29.370> were<00:02:29.430> adapted<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.709> survive<00:02:31.709> on

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
that they were adapted to survive on

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.629 
that they were adapted to survive on
this<00:02:32.400> changing<00:02:32.939> landscape<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.719> so<00:02:34.409> it<00:02:35.040> meant

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
this changing landscape and so it meant

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.179 
this changing landscape and so it meant
that<00:02:35.760> my<00:02:36.329> idea<00:02:36.659> had<00:02:36.870> some<00:02:37.079> viability<00:02:37.439> that<00:02:37.829> was

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
that my idea had some viability that was

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.890 
that my idea had some viability that was
perhaps<00:02:38.400> correct<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.420> wasn't<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.750> bad

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
perhaps correct that it wasn't a bad

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:49.040 
perhaps correct that it wasn't a bad
idea<00:02:40.290> after<00:02:40.500> all

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.110
