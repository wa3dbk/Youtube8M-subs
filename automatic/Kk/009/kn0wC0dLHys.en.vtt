basically what you do is you try to
Diamond<00:01:43.890> skin<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.729> much<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:47.659> that's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
Diamond skin as much as you can that's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
what I'm going to be doing anyway if I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
what I'm going to be doing anyway if I
did<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:52.759> terrible<00:01:53.759> latency<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:55.409> be

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
did not have terrible latency I would be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.880 
did not have terrible latency I would be
diamond<00:01:55.979> skinning<00:01:56.490> every<00:01:56.729> time<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.149> saw<00:01:57.390> him

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
diamond skinning every time I saw him

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.380 
diamond skinning every time I saw him
charging<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.130> his<00:01:59.310> weapons<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> white

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and blue energy because that means he's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.330 
and blue energy because that means he's
teleporting<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.509> he<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.380> either<00:02:04.680> teleport

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

on you on your follower or away and if
he<00:02:08.729> teleports<00:02:09.239> away<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> need<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> run<00:02:09.989> over

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
he teleports away you need to run over

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.150 
he teleports away you need to run over
to<00:02:10.440> him<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:10.979> all

no for him I use frost Nova to protect
my<00:02:14.430> Templar<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.420> way<00:02:15.570> there's<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.870> 50/50

chance of him teleporting onto the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.150 
chance of him teleporting onto the
Templar<00:02:18.810> instead<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.350> me<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.740> try<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.950> keep

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
Templar instead of me and I try to keep

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.760 
Templar instead of me and I try to keep
my<00:02:20.250> Templar<00:02:20.670> alive<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.320> take<00:02:22.560> that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
my Templar alive so you can take that
