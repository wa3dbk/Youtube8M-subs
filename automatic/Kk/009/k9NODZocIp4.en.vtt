00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.980
 the weeding of the sun is a very important technique to obtain production 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.899
 quality 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:15.590
 r you can carry out various phases the fundamental thing is the weeding of mine outlets 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.750
 that is, the cleaning of the tris emilia which can be done by authorizing 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.200
 mechanical means or chemical herbicides in particular with mine 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.890
 forged 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.810
 therefore always starting with punitive quotes the optimal protective for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 get good results in weed control 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.699
 as I said to you then he only needs it can be done every three months has been 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.430
 after sowing with residual products that inhibit the birth of 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.500
 weeds or after the birth of the time post emergency culture with products 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.840
 that instead hit the pregnant senate and eliminated them when. they are already present 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.140
 in the field for some nights a few years ago it was prevalent to the employment of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.130
 post-emergency herbicides 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.850
 and why we had a range of products that are also strangely post-emergency 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 recently there is a very limited link despite the disarmament of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 post-emergency is still extremely effective is advisable 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.219
 however, this does not mean that it is also possible to carry out the intervention of 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.290
 we talk about this before 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.940
 the products to be used in take without veils as I always have in summer 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.230
 in the table you can see these are products that have petersen 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.600
 enough camping being a good thing if you opt for weeding to press 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.860
 genzano use at least a dozen of 2 products are mitra we say of 2 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130
 products because individual products 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.270
 do not have a sufficient range of action to control all 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.829
 weeds each has its own characteristics everyone has their points 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.460
 weak present pendine fb has as its classical weak point the control of the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.810
 night the amaranth as for example roma zone i met en using a weak point the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.690
 control of the single year so it is always good to make a 3 way duo mix 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.480
 try to broaden the spectrum of action and then choose two or three of them 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.380
 products I remind you of example that if you have abutilon problems you are expected to 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.909
 birth of monterone vast plots it is definitely tommasone the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.950
 product to use because of these is the most effective against 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.019
 of the angela but i dont also keep in mind that it is not said that these 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.879
 weeds are decisive in particular if there will be no application after the application 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.400
 of rains it is probable that some pests will snap and is necessary 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.989
 however, intervene in emergency taxes in any case a mixture 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.630
 theoretically names celebrated 3 month Sardinian a good perspective of control of the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.759
 weed 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:37.189
 going from the post-emergency phase, as I said before, let's be very careful 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.430
 restricted but the remaining products are extremely effective 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.830
 intervention that must be done by the two real leaves of the soy the second trilobate 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.549
 on average the classic intervention period the product to be used i 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.010
 masa box which has a toast feedback as you see is the status in the table 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.289
 rather broad which includes both dicotyledons and grasses 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:01.350
 its weak point is the madmox 2 controller which cannot god 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.130
 and the monster some limit on portulache on the opium crowd while like 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.549
 I said to an action discreetly against the grasses 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.650
 if we want to expand the action of your network 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.380
 and now all the large leaf weeds must mix 5 grams d 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.930
 harmony this mixture allows a very effective control in practice 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.550
 against all the dicotyledonous weeds although as you can see from the table 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.690
 limit the granny cydia app activity of the mix often another product 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.050
 that it is possible to use mesenzana soy taxes for the control of the 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.950
 dicotiledoni 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.510
 aide intended as you see in this case too the spectrum of action extremely 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.830
 wide is practically all the dicotyledons and absolutely not 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.700
 with regard to grasses, however, this spectrum of action is so broad and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.330
 only valid for interventions on very small pests we just say 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.029
 nate 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.679
 here we must intervene more early than in the past 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:57.769
 first for the intervention with implementing go to are your love also in this case 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.939
 a discreet control of the dicotyledonous weeds we conclude as always with 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.769
 the similar terms these are all strange and effective towards the 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.259
 most common that comes from soy see you in summer on the table you can 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.899
 choose one anyway among these because they are all with vice 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.939
 extremely effective 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.310
 I have concluded that I thank you
