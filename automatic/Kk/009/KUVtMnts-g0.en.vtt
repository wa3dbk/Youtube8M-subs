00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 presentations and Palestinians this would be frightening if we attacked them as 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.529
 ex-aldermen your colleagues 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.050
 the first note that the left block wants to make on this proposal that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.089
 we are discussing here 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.930
 is that this municipal assembly is invaluable to the city of 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:36.650
 Lisbon 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.800
 we have here today a proposal because the Members of this House 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 the boldness and firmness of rejecting a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.030
 a proposal that the heavy doctor brought us here 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.590
 of the sky in the fund of real estate investment where it was delivered not salt 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.820
 the terrain between meats as well as the fillet mingnon of repulsion it does 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.160
 the birthing can bite with what was the case several tens of square meters of the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.970
 Castle 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.250
 in addition to the proposed real estate fund and run it by an institution 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.260
 those who do not pay taxes to the state as 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 other businessmen 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.620
 and so the first note you need to do is that it's worth seeing 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.450
 this week the CEPAL ditch refuse documents from the chamber because it is known 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.990
 right to premium 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.350
 This is good for the camera, it's good for you, not if it includes cities 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.930
 Lisbon with short deadlines 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.900
 The second question is what we are dealing with here is what we are here today. 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 to discuss 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 we have to undress with the deal 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 see the problem of the chamber managing to take up this subject in which 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.430
 gil clear is the magician is trying to treat 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.320
 do not have any doubt it's just the matter just read but the winds that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.690
 presents the proposals 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.950
 not i got iran signed without reading another way 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 I think we're dealing with the end of the years he dies 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.970
 so I usually go 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.580
 and therefore its adopted soon happened to see a concrete problem that every year 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.649
 can be exhausted in that the municipalities even times the lisboners mullet 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.149
 which is how the camera manages to have can on the grounds of the park 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.679
 mayer to take the time to spare, 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.239
 recovery and reconversion of the park mayer this is the problem that we are 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.149
 treat jec here 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.919
 this is not our proposal nor would it be proposed that the bloc should 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.259
 counties 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.050
 we think we have to make the proposal 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.009
 is the first proposal that matches your 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.599
 and that we let pass 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.409
 we have to have all the trade the police started brigado and hospitable go out 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.110
 election eve leaves after elections because I did not feel anything 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.360
 our principles as a function of the telebrÃ¡s the lisboetas can not be 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.049
 dependent 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.429
 of the electoral acts say that 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.879
 of evil the less the simpsons to the lusa one that is better 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.879
 and so we have strength to make support possible 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.189
 and saying very clearly that Afghan troops
