sometimes foundations have a different
product<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.800> there<00:05:52.979> maybe<00:05:53.580> it's<00:05:53.849> like<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.000> water

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
product in there maybe it's like a water

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.209 
product in there maybe it's like a water
base<00:05:54.509> that<00:05:54.719> may<00:05:54.840> not<00:05:55.020> mix<00:05:55.259> with<00:05:55.380> oil<00:05:55.620> but<00:05:55.949> I

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
base that may not mix with oil but I

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.640 
base that may not mix with oil but I
would<00:05:56.909> say<00:05:57.030> try<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.360> with<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.169> sample<00:05:58.560> that

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
would say try it with the sample that

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:06.170 
would say try it with the sample that
you<00:05:58.710> can<00:05:58.949> get<00:05:59.130> and<00:05:59.520> oh<00:05:59.820> yeah<00:06:04.520> okay<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.849> is
