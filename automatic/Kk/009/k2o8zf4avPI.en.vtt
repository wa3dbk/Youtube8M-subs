00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello dear friends lovers 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.860
 fishing 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.539
 today I want to tell you about one 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 feeder feeders that I came up with myself 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.460
 ordinary 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.849
 feeder feeders which we use 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.909
 all their advantages and disadvantages we 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.739
 know and the main drawback they have is 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:30.899
 that they cling to stony bent 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.760
 To avoid this, I came up with this one 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:37.660
 feeder 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:43.270
 which I called Stavropol that she 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:47.020
 is a long mesh 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.150
 cylinder length mesh cylinder top 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.240
 parts of which is located float with 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.220
 eyelet at the bottom of the sinker like 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.100
 make such a feeder for that i 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.520
 used this construction sevka 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.960
 which is called facade with dimensions 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 and tweet forces at 7 millimeters 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.499
 leo of our feeders will need a cut 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.499
 grid length of 180 millimeters 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
 fold in half 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:25.270
 drew attention to what is in this grid 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.139
 go along the thicker twigs across 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.069
 less . 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:36.369
 thick thick of located along 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:41.829
 feeding troughs making overlapping water we are one 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:45.990
 the cell formed the joint I am flashing 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:48.340
 such thick nylon thread 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.939
 the top of the trough I insert 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:59.289
 cork or foam float 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:04.920
 made a hole insert wire with 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:08.229
 loop the edges of the cork with a loop 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.629
 float with eyelet 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.060
 insert it here in the lower part 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:20.390
 we insert cargo well i use loads 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.890
 5066 and 80 grams of the central part 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.010
 weights I have a hole insert 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.010
 and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.400
 ordinary cork can be best 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:42.019
 Of course copper we pierce through cells 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.560
 we turn off the weight 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.200
 superfluous 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.000
 we got so beautiful 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.000
 the design of the seam which form the thread and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.799
 the float we lubricate profusely and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:04.430
 passive glue construction becomes 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:08.750
 tough and durable here she will answer here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.260
 such a strong and tough design for 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.109
 what is needed such a long trough 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.299
 firstly she flies beautifully and tried 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.160
 make it shorter well somewhere around 120 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.109
 millimeters 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.769
 unstable in flight and the most 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.980
 the main thing after the feeder falls 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.980
 to the bottom 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.940
 washed out feed and you need to extract and 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.269
 called out of the water she goes fine on 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:44.290
 the surface does not cling to the stone and 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:48.769
 and already tetra at a distance of 15 meters 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.910
 after starting pulling out for dinner on 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.699
 the surface is now arises 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.650
 question how in such a closed trough 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:05.680
 fill the bait is very easy to take 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:09.819
 prikormku type in hand and slightly 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.819
 twirling in our feeder 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.880
 We dent bait inside 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.540
 size and weight of the amount of weight 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.000
 bait every fisherman determines for 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.860
 himself depending on the test his rod 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.110
 I have a test of 120 grams for 2 Fedorov 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:40.890
 so I use such weights 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.220
 5066 and 80 grams Well it seems all 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.870
 what i wanted to say 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.600
 try it can someone get better 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.630
 the design may be the same to someone 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.080
 useful but for the three seasons that i 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.020
 I use the data as circles for me 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.000
 I was driving all 2 cliffs and so what 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.350
 says that's all 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.350
 no tail you no scales
