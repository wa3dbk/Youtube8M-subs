00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the animals can also be possessed 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 by demonic entities in various 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.690
 occasions we have talked about the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.170
 possessions in people in objects 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.830
 inanimate as furniture dolls paintings 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.390
 or even toys but if the spirits 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 can get to adhere to any 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.310
 way of life or inanimate objects 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.279
 they can also own the animals 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.740
 according to experts in the paranormal there 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.009
 well-documented cases throughout the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.590
 history of dogs cats birds and up 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.440
 horses that have been possessed by bad 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.570
 spirits transforming them into beasts 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.200
 diabolical and making life miserable 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 to their owners then the answer 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.489
 to one of the great controversies of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 paranormal world is that animals 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.629
 can be possessed by demons at 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 just like humans 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.239
 animal possession a whole reality is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.190
 a proven fact that animals 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.010
 they have a soul since they are capable of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.530
 demonstrate emotions otherwise 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 these creatures would be like a shell 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.880
 empty but leaving aside 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.550
 the controversy many spirits 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 malevolent or demons have the ability 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.130
 of owning both animals and objects the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.220
 reality is that animals are in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.750
 harmony with spiritual activity 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.570
 being able to feel entities from other 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 dimensions and that is long before that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.010
 human beings we are capable of 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.020
 detect paranormal activity the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.960
 animals have already perceived those 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 presences this causes the animal to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.940
 becomes a temptation for the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.369
 possession by such spirits the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.860
 purpose of the possession of the animals 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.530
 is to use them as means to harm 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.990
 possession humans is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.490
 temporary during which they can do 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.800
 that animals have a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 unusual behavior like attacking 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.420
 wildly to the people without explanation 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.920
 apparent or making insects and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.650
 animals cockroaches rats bed bugs 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.810
 mosquitoes and so on multiply very 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.810
 fast so that they become a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.390
 problem for humans cases of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.610
 Edward's animal possessions in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 of the most famous researchers of the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.160
 paranormal who died in 2006 said that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.890
 the cases of possessions in animals 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 they are historically well documented 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 from before the middle ages 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 warren in one of his publications 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.459
 remembered a case occurred in generic 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.860
 where a dog changed its attitude 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.560
 gentle for a ferocious beast the dog 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.920
 apparently drooling with dark eyes 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.440
 like coal repeatedly the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.980
 animal bit wildly to his master 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.690
 besides showing incredible strength 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.519
 but the most surprising thing was that the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.310
 veterinarian was not able to 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.590
 diagnose any disease 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.989
 the animal continued to be the subject of 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.019
 possession so they requested the help 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.510
 from an exorcist all present 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.030
 they assured that while he was performing 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.760
 the exorcism the dog became very rigid 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.220
 with bulging eyes he growled and 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 shuddered as a person to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.500
 end with moan that seemed 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.840
 proceed from hell itself from 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.520
 of then the animal never returned to 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.830
 to have 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.200
 unusually aggressive behavior the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.510
 warren also referred to a 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.630
 possessed cat that tried to kill his 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.330
 owner a woman who bought a cat 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.460
 and he took it home he did not know there was 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.340
 been used in magic rituals 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.140
 Black one night she woke up to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.230
 find the cat on the top 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.410
 of his chest showing his fangs 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.200
 the ears pulled back growling 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.360
 and spitting in his throat but what 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.459
 more frightening was that a shadow was 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.130
 loomed around the cat while the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.680
 woman was drowned almost without power nor 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.290
 breathe the woman began to pray like 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.330
 he could get the cat out 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.330
 running from home to not return 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.209
 never in new york there was also a case 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.520
 of animal positions some 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.530
 young people who worked in stables 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.720
 they were involved in a sect 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.130
 satanic and rituals celebrated with the 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.320
 animals 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.440
 apparently a demonic entity had 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.810
 owned by a horse a girl of about 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.370
 nine years he was riding a 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.350
 horse when suddenly 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.960
 animal began to run through the countryside 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.110
 as if driven by a force 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.090
 supernatural at a given moment the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.120
 horse threw the girl to the ground and 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 while foaming at the mouth he tried 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.970
 of attacking her two veterinarians were not 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.449
 able to diagnose you absolutely 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.880
 nothing through a ritual of exorcism the 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.150
 horse was again the docile animal that 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.760
 it was before animals demonic entities 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.310
 the animals can also be possessed 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.830
 by demonic entities signs of a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.620
 animal possession discarding the problem 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.199
 of bad behavior any pet 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.020
 innocent could end up harboring 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.750
 a demonic entity ruining thus the 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.120
 life of its owner but if you know 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.270
 correctly detect the signals of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.800
 warning can react 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.110
 quickly to minimize the damage to 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.000
 animal you have to pay attention to 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.479
 sudden changes in behavior 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.300
 of the animal a pet 2 and it becomes 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.569
 Suddenly shy happens to have a 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.629
 depressive behavior and it ends up being 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.639
 the pet has a behavior 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:41.490
 apparently normal but at least 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.830
 you expect it becomes destructive 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.349
 the animal demonstrates extreme reactions 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.659
 to ordinary events like a dog that 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.779
 is thrown towards an unusual door 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:54.749
 barking scratches and howling for no reason 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.879
 Apparent the pet becomes euphoric and 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:59.270
 hyperactive when there is some kind of 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.339
 problem at home as if he were 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.499
 enjoying the circumstance another 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:07.080
 point to keep in mind are the bad guys 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:09.180
 habits that the animal can take as 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.909
 Enjoy dirt or eating 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.729
 waste a behavior that has never been 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.249
 usual in a pet owned 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:20.189
 squeaks howls and even screams 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:23.249
 unusual and this behavior increases with the 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.529
 time and without having a logical cause the 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.830
 pet acts in an unusual way 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.229
 sacred religious objects together with the 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.779
 arrival of a new pet the family 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:37.229
 begins to experience events 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.999
 unexplained strange accidents a 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.949
 bad luck or other streak 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.110
 difficulties 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.510
 as we have been able to verify the animals 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.600
 they are not exempt from the possessions of 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.669
 demonic entities that's why it's always 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.669
 important to protect the pet 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:56.130
 by amulets incense candles u 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.080
 other techniques to avoid this kind of 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.590
 phenomena that escape our 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.590
 logic
