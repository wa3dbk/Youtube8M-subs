00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.540
 animals that you are going to put in their 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 sanctuaries 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.080
 do not worry we are going to prohibit the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.150
 circuses and from there after a year they 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.350

 channel that he gets to the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.170
 avant-garde also because the circus must 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.910
 be with animals because people what 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 more wants to see and children are the 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.479
 animals to the circuses our animals 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.000
 they do not need government money 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.649
 because we have we are 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880
 self-sufficient to maintain our 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.890
 animals while we can continue 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.050
 working with them because once they 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.759

 they had to emigrate from their country and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.700
 Now the Mexican country is not in a 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.730
