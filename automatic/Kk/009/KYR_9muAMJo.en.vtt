00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
a problem at all I mean offense all last

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.520 
a problem at all I mean offense all last
year<00:00:58.680> try<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.190> tempo<00:00:59.550> against<00:01:00.539> us<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> I

year try to your tempo against us and I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.130 
year try to your tempo against us and I
mean<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.340> nothing<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.940> us<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mean it was nothing for us this is a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.690 
mean it was nothing for us this is a
little<00:01:04.350> adjustment<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.100> really<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.640> think

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
little adjustment I really don't think

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
little adjustment I really don't think
it<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> tempo<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.960> us<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.229> think

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it was the tempo they got to us I think

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.590 
it was the tempo they got to us I think
it<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.580> fact<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.390> weren't

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it was just the fact that we weren't

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.969 
it was just the fact that we weren't
locked<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> focused<00:01:10.590> maybe<00:01:10.799> all

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
not so much biggest probably just really

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.649 
not so much biggest probably just really
good<00:01:52.799> setting<00:01:53.369> those<00:01:53.490> screens<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.390> quick

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
good setting those screens really quick

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and doing things like they were good uh

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
and doing things like they were good uh
that<00:01:57.329> we're<00:01:57.479> good<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.840> finding<00:01:58.049> our<00:01:58.290> stall

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that we're good at finding our stall

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.130 
that we're good at finding our stall
spots<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> attacking<00:01:59.369> our<00:01:59.520> soft<00:01:59.790> spots<00:02:00.140> but

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
spots and attacking our soft spots but

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.139 
spots and attacking our soft spots but
it<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.950> rallied<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.430> ball<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> made<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it we rallied to the ball and made the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.210 
it we rallied to the ball and made the
tackles<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
tackles and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.340 
tackles and
came<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.700> on<00:02:04.880> top<00:02:04.910> still<00:02:05.390> find<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.020> hard<00:02:06.080> to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
came out on top still find it hard to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.750 
came out on top still find it hard to
get<00:02:06.590> guys<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.160> off<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.370> field<00:02:07.400> just

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
get guys on and off the field just

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.520 
get guys on and off the field just
within<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.300> weight<00:02:08.540> when<00:02:08.720> they<00:02:08.869> got<00:02:09.050> going

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
within the weight when they got going

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.050 
within the weight when they got going
and<00:02:09.740> maybe<00:02:09.920> start<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.220> get<00:02:10.369> for<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> family<00:02:10.790> so

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
and maybe start to get for a family so

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.580 
and maybe start to get for a family so
that's<00:02:11.300> always<00:02:11.570> hard<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.140> mean<00:02:12.260> that's<00:02:12.440> why

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
that's always hard I mean that's why

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.040 
that's always hard I mean that's why
tempo<00:02:12.950> offices<00:02:13.520> do<00:02:13.730> tipo<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.210> mean<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.750> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
tempo offices do tipo I mean just to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.020 
tempo offices do tipo I mean just to
keep<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.920> defensive<00:02:16.400> players<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.820> field

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
keep the defensive players on the field

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.880 
keep the defensive players on the field
and<00:02:17.390> that's<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.320> whole<00:02:18.470> thing<00:02:18.500> around

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
and that's the whole thing around

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.830 
and that's the whole thing around
tip-off<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.210> course<00:02:20.390> that's<00:02:20.630> going<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
tip-off and so of course that's going to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.490 
tip-off and so of course that's going to
be<00:02:20.900> difficult<00:02:21.610> wait<00:02:22.610> expect<00:02:23.060> resentment<00:02:23.750> uh<00:02:23.990> I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
just been something we hone in on during

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.140

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
know good defense causes turnovers right

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.270 
know good defense causes turnovers right
now<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.549> think<00:03:37.700> we<00:03:37.910> know<00:03:38.780> at<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.019> top<00:03:39.230> number<00:03:39.440> 14

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
now I think we know at the top number 14

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.640 
now I think we know at the top number 14
turnover<00:03:40.640> ratio<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.380> something

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
turnover ratio but it's just something

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.289 
turnover ratio but it's just something
we<00:03:42.680> always<00:03:42.920> worked<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.670> then<00:03:43.970> get<00:03:44.180> the

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
we always worked on it then get the

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.509 
we always worked on it then get the
closer<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.049> are<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.320> ball<00:03:45.530> then<00:03:46.220> if<00:03:46.340> you

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
closer you are to the ball then if you

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.860 
closer you are to the ball then if you
can<00:03:46.610> get<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.880> ball<00:03:47.000> you're<00:03:47.180> more<00:03:47.390> valuable<00:03:47.420> to

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
can get the ball you're more valuable to

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.690
