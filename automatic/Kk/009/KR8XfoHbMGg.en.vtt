00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
that much different between the systems
I<00:01:47.939> can't<00:01:48.509> tell<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.929> personally<00:01:49.530> whether<00:01:49.679> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
I can't tell you personally whether you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
I can't tell you personally whether you
should<00:01:50.219> get<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.609> not<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
should get it or not if you don't have a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020 
should get it or not if you don't have a
3ds<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:53.039> you're<00:01:53.159> thinking<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.700> getting

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
3ds and you're thinking about getting

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
3ds and you're thinking about getting
one<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.899> personally<00:01:55.109> wait<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> new

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
one I would personally wait for the new

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
one I would personally wait for the new
3ds<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.659> basically<00:01:57.810> future

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
3ds because that's basically future

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
3ds because that's basically future
proofing<00:01:58.799> yourself<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.399> yes<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.909> more

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
proofing yourself and yes it's more

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
proofing yourself and yes it's more
expensive<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.049> pick<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.289> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
expensive and you can pick up the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.219 
expensive and you can pick up the
original<00:02:01.590> 3ds<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.210> pittance<00:02:03.749> at<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
original 3ds for a pittance at the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.169 
original 3ds for a pittance at the
moment<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:05.009> they've<00:02:05.219> announced<00:02:05.909> this

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
moment because they've announced this

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.719 
moment because they've announced this
new<00:02:06.240> 3ds<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.229> still<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> worth

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
new 3ds I still think it would be worth

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
new 3ds I still think it would be worth
your<00:02:08.910> while<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.179> wait<00:02:09.600> just<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.170> bit<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
your while to wait just a little bit and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.979 
your while to wait just a little bit and
pick<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.550> new<00:02:11.700> system<00:02:12.120> however<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.840> you've

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
pick up the new system however if you've

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.630 
pick up the new system however if you've
already<00:02:13.110> got<00:02:13.500> one<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.739> you're<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.099> two<00:02:14.280> minds

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
already got one and you're in two minds

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.729 
already got one and you're in two minds
about<00:02:14.790> getting<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.629> think<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.379> best<00:02:16.409> thing

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
about getting it I think the best thing

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.380 
about getting it I think the best thing
to<00:02:16.769> do<00:02:16.950> probably<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.000> get

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
to do probably be to get

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.870 
to do probably be to get
hands<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.960> its<00:02:19.110> first<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.520> feel

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
an original 3ds and it's looking a bit

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.150 
an original 3ds and it's looking a bit
knackered<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.319> you're<00:02:49.770> thinking<00:02:50.040> about

something<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> renew<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.070> then<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> new<00:02:53.910> 3ds

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
something to renew it then a new 3ds

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.870 
something to renew it then a new 3ds
would<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.660> an<00:02:54.780> excellent<00:02:55.470> decision<00:02:55.739> but<00:02:56.730> if

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
would be an excellent decision but if

so to sum up is the new 3d s worth it in
a<00:03:16.980> word<00:03:17.220> yes<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:19.019> has<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.410> be<00:03:19.500> what<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.130> a

Nintendo<00:04:21.329> has<00:04:21.450> had<00:04:21.539> some<00:04:21.720> problems<00:04:22.260> with

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
Brazil due to tax reasons and I think

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.940 
Brazil due to tax reasons and I think
profitability<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:27.750> they<00:04:27.990> either<00:04:28.530> have<00:04:28.800> to

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
profitability and so they either have to

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.040 
profitability and so they either have to
sell<00:04:29.130> their<00:04:29.310> games<00:04:29.550> at<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.910> hugely<00:04:30.450> marked<00:04:30.930> up

separately<00:05:24.960> which<00:05:25.200> seems<00:05:25.700> very<00:05:26.700> odd<00:05:27.120> I'm<00:05:27.600> not

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
separately which seems very odd I'm not

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
reasoning behind all this but the fact

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.620 
reasoning behind all this but the fact
of<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.440> matter<00:05:31.500> is<00:05:31.860> no<00:05:32.280> unfortunately<00:05:33.000> it

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
of the matter is no unfortunately it

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.540 
of the matter is no unfortunately it
won't<00:05:33.900> work<00:05:34.170> with<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.380> Wii<00:05:34.560> U<00:05:34.740> gamepad<00:05:35.190> charger

won't work with a Wii U gamepad charger
I<00:05:35.730> must<00:05:35.970> admit<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.210> thought<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.600> same<00:05:36.780> thing

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
I must admit I thought the same thing

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.890 
I must admit I thought the same thing
when<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.170> got<00:05:37.410> my<00:05:37.590> 3ds<00:05:38.100> but<00:05:39.060> it's<00:05:39.210> just<00:05:39.480> not<00:05:39.750> the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
when I got my 3ds but it's just not the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.300 
when I got my 3ds but it's just not the
case<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.320> charges<00:05:40.680> are<00:05:40.830> a<00:05:40.860> slightly

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
case the charges are a slightly

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.740 
case the charges are a slightly
different<00:05:41.580> size<00:05:41.940> but<00:05:42.150> they<00:05:42.270> just<00:05:42.450> happen<00:05:42.720> to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
different size but they just happen to

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.900 
different size but they just happen to
look<00:05:43.080> very<00:05:43.110> similar<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:44.040> knew<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:44.580> much<00:05:44.730> for
