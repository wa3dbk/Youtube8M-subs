and<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.620> my<00:02:25.800> passion<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:28.080> seeing<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
and is my passion so I'm seeing that

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.860 
and is my passion so I'm seeing that
core<00:02:29.819> root<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:31.020> who<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.200> am<00:02:31.370> was<00:02:32.370> really<00:02:33.180> what

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
core root of who I am was really what

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.670 
core root of who I am was really what
was<00:02:34.050> making<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.709> money<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.400> me<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:39.680> think
