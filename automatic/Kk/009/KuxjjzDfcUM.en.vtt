he's nasty if he can skate probably be

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.039

around<00:01:22.609> our<00:01:22.789> test<00:01:23.030> will<00:01:23.270> run<00:01:23.630> our<00:01:23.810> test

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
around our test will run our test

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.949 
around our test will run our test
obviously<00:01:24.289> 10<00:01:25.280> toes<00:01:25.549> well<00:01:26.090> Ron<00:01:26.329> is<00:01:26.539> missing<00:01:26.869> a

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
obviously 10 toes well Ron is missing a

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.139 
obviously 10 toes well Ron is missing a
couple<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.289> teeth<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.799> think<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.700> think<00:01:28.969> so

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
couple of teeth I think I think so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.819 
couple of teeth I think I think so
because<00:01:29.329> we<00:01:29.479> all<00:01:29.659> know<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.990> wild<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.530> little

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
because we all know the wild a little

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.010 
because we all know the wild a little
bit<00:01:30.950> aggressive<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.880> uh<00:01:32.000> I<00:01:32.270> love<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.780> bangs

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
bit aggressive and uh I love the bangs

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.870 
bit aggressive and uh I love the bangs
so<00:01:33.319> I<00:01:33.380> think<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.619> probably<00:01:33.770> would<00:01:34.039> be<00:01:34.159> quite<00:01:34.789> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
so I think I probably would be quite the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.510 
so I think I probably would be quite the
best<00:01:35.060> hockey<00:01:35.240> player<00:01:35.709> out<00:01:36.709> of<00:01:36.860> all<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.189> Kings

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.160 
best hockey player out of all the Kings
players<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.209> I<00:01:38.360> might<00:01:38.539> have<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.719> chance<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.079> be

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
players and I might have a chance to be

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.690 
players and I might have a chance to be
one<00:01:39.259> of<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:39.439> best<00:01:39.530> hockey<00:01:39.739> players<00:01:40.069> of<00:01:40.549> all

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700
