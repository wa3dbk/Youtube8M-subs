00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
camera cuz from what I hear steady shot

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.720 
camera cuz from what I hear steady shot
reduces<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> video<00:00:42.750> quality<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:44.100> intense

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
reduces the video quality so in intense

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750 
reduces the video quality so in intense
video<00:00:44.879> footage<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.690> saw<00:00:46.520> steady<00:00:47.520> shot

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
was on so I don't know how much it

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:58.650 
was on so I don't know how much it
reduced<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> video<00:00:50.699> quality<00:00:51.739> but

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.960

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
like here as far as my thoughts on the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.550 
like here as far as my thoughts on the
sony<00:01:05.830> action<00:01:06.040> camera

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
sony action camera

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
sony action camera
like<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.310> said<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.000> video<00:01:09.240> quality<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
like I said I think the video quality is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.940 
like I said I think the video quality is
better<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:12.409> GoPro<00:01:13.409> hero2

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
better on the GoPro hero2

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
better on the GoPro hero2

I don't know about the GoPro hero3

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
I don't know about the GoPro hero3

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
because I haven't worked with it yet but

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
because I haven't worked with it yet but
from<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> hear<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> GoPro<00:01:19.259> Hero<00:01:19.290> 3<00:01:19.650> has<00:01:19.890> a

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.960 

now<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.690> JVC<00:02:11.590> camera<00:02:12.099> from<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.489> hear<00:02:12.790> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
now the JVC camera from what I hear it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.720 
now the JVC camera from what I hear it
does<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.630> 720<00:02:14.319> 120<00:02:14.920> frames<00:02:15.040> per<00:02:15.250> second

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
does have the 720 120 frames per second

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.089 
does have the 720 120 frames per second
but<00:02:15.880> from<00:02:16.150> what<00:02:16.299> I<00:02:16.329> hear<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.870> quality<00:02:17.620> is

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
but from what I hear the the quality is

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.980 
but from what I hear the the quality is
not<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.610> good<00:02:18.940> as<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.239> sony<00:02:19.630> action<00:02:19.870> camera<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.770 

so<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.550> said<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.790> was<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.210> main<00:02:26.390> reason

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
so like I said that was the main reason

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.640 
so like I said that was the main reason
why<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.900> bought<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.350> sony<00:02:27.590> action<00:02:27.860> camera<00:02:29.650> was

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
why I bought this sony action camera was

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.840 
why I bought this sony action camera was
for<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> slow<00:02:31.430> motion<00:02:31.670> capability<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.850> and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
for the slow motion capability and and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.490 
for the slow motion capability and and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
the camera on the side of the helmet

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.840 
the camera on the side of the helmet
angle<00:03:41.040> always<00:03:42.040> like<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> camera<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.760> the
