00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.529
 well hello to all friends sÃ©verac 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.480
 yart i hope you're fine 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.640
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.580
 second presentation for me of a 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.810
 one orders so with a block command 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.420
 we will succeed in being able to drive a 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.090
 3.6 car you'll say the map 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.500
 it is rather weird it is rather 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.800
 handed over without you maybe going to tell me 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.190
 finally it's actually the shader it does not 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.359
 does even on the stone in fact of the shader 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.470
 acid I love I think that's it yes 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.530
 shader r5 poster 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.940
 so that's distorting everything I'm you 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.649
 will make a short video later to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.340
 know more about that brief today 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.460
 is on the map 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.200
 in fine who roam of unity paradox 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.030
 so apparently the map on the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.050
 description we do not worry but we 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.910
 is not there for that I just took 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.809
 yesterday my to be able to do the decor 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.040
 today we will learn to drive 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.370
 a car in minecraft everything 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.320
 simply 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.850
 so for that you will need the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.920
 how of blocks and the order in 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.360
 the description you will have to copy it 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.710
 stick inside the colon blog just 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.729
 here there we do control v gives 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.170
 this is the order got into the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.909
 colon block and so to tell you again 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.240
 world bolt you know because that I 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.299
 viva 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 @ peace in the parenthesis before not what 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.890
 country like end that is reduced 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.479
 underscore pardon block as soon as you 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.380
 enter and that's it if you take a small 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.450
 button you so to order at 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.040
 inside and so on the map 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.210
 normally there is not all this 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.860
 zone on the ground it's just me who 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.640
 unite for because if you 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.229
 know a little bit less 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.900
 orders will be a little bit a big one 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.659
 machine that will ring so it's 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.640
 party cheer right away gao 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.020
 I hope I'm doing big enough because 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.110
 that otherwise it did it in that sense 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.880
 down is not very serious taste tac so 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.700
 not rich at minecraft at minecraft who 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.900
 is the one who creates he created a lot 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.150
 besides customs orders 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.880
 it is pretty big in there and so we 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.250
 thank you this is the link of his from his 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.689
 original video evening in the registration 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.180
 so the machine and finishes assembling 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.250
 so here we have the panels so the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.960
 car that we can drive 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.259
 simply so parisian minecraft 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.030
 get it in the right thing to decide 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.079
 get it is so see with the music a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.079
 little bit of it because the stylus 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:23.490
 wafa ok it's okay I was moving 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.600
 more ourselves not why listen to me 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.070
 believe that in fact there is a small problem 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.930
 with this music slam head of the 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.570
 canton minecraft version in his music 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.520
 Roman evening it's not a big deal so we 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.630
 will be staging this year there 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.920
 this week we will change the time I 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.470
 test the map listen at the same time 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.420
 runs away so that's how decree is 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.170
 now wright click here to have 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.150
 our said m 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.610
 to train the car we first put the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.560
 key plus get it not received anymore their 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.390
 stand and there we have an egg that appears 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.190
 like these miraculously we can 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.040
 delete our system and just keep 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.510
 the egg is actually spawn tac the car 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.860
 so the car a pretty cool design there 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.780
 there's no need for Easter textures or 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.890
 anything this leprechaun mind quarters 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.240
 inside you have to aim for 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.820
 can go in and you'll see that 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.080
 this car is fantastic for 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.160
 not spent either a huge thing and 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.350
 to make shorts I know 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.730
 not if you do it a little back 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.490
 towards the future between like that it's 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.660
 huge so you're going to see the wheels in 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.010
 obsidian and twitter the design is 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.170
 nice we're going in 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.070
 you will see that they are not flying 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.900
 like other cars 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.770
 so we will move forward with the keys 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.850
 Finally, I do not know what your 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.960
 keys to advance in minecraft so 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.520
 we do not move with his keys there 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.990
 it's really with the slider of the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.730
 mouse we will fight 5 it's really 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.980
 with the mouse cursor we aim for a 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.830
 place is just so here 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.570
 to start the car we press 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.380
 start by opening the kitten we just 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.150
 to click on start 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.860
 we can also see you change the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.180
 speed so here we are at 0 1 we go to 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.970
 0.5 it's going a little faster 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.320
 it's not bad either we'll try 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.470
 to go on the road there is one can 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.090
 no we can not block the water that 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.960
 waited for one overthrows but another and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.870
 because they had a little hole in 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.600
 staircase do not you it's not here 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.170
 so so start we will get in 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.850
 Maximum speed is chipped up here 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.230
 we could see it's okay it's pretty stylish 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.390
 would say the road from m caillaud handle if 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.010
 you see in dragon ball 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.330
 the amap is enough it's pretty strange 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.000
 I hope you have not given too much 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.680
 want to 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.320
 want to vomit anyway and now 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.489
 instead of taking all the others 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.530
 tags in the mouth we can go into 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.690
 way back to the future of a sudden with 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.160
 these lover fashion so the obermatt 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.540
 what is it there I do not know 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.800
 why it does not make parcels is this 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.110
 that if I go on the arm it was because 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.210
 that I'm ok that's because it's 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.020
 a particular brand 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.300
 wait, let's go back here 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.260
 come back there and make love her fashion 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.030
 to get off the car be you 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.220
 click stop in the chat either you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.290
 you go down with a smic in all 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.160
 simply with as in the 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.030
 same usual cards luxury in hand 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.640
 a map there so start over mode 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.690
 why do not take off normally 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.450
 they take off the small particles 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.730
 may need to go faster 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:59.760
 no that's not it 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.110
 this is it here 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.580
 but here you see it so that's it if you 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.540
 also you want to make a little game 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.340
 it's not a short film 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.580
 cinematic anywhere that it can be 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.050
 nice with shaders and it's 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.850
 So a little bit too fast because 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.250
 she's not managing the same because to clear the 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.990
 car down right but here it is 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.970
 it's a small order that's pretty 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.710
 friendly so there we lose 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.510
 altitude I think we can go up 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.740
 or no no I think we can not 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.850
 back up he did not specify I looked 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.610
 the video of the uptr he did not 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.780
 precisely be very serious so voila 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.130
 what the little particles that 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.460
 always add a nice little effect 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.280
 let's see this brief 5 it's super that super 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.660
 weird 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.310
 here with the road or there the road 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.009
 do not go back we go 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.409
 to drop into nothingness and in the 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.349
 oversights of the ultimate abyss we will 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:49.349
 come back here we will get back with 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.879
 normal little shader which makes everything 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.460
 lead the game a little bit nicer 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.449
 and suddenly I hope you 'll have 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.199
 enjoyed this video friends do not hesitate 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.580
 not to show it to me in the 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.219
 live commentary is still at 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.839
 subscribing to my channel so I
