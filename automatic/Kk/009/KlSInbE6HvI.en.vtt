00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hi, I was telling you the other day that I 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 they like the raw ingredients in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.070
 hot dishes and a couple of days ago 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.710
 I was in a Vietnamese restaurant and its 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.660
 Chicken curry was half cooked and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 half raw I have no idea how I 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.650
 they do but as always I will make a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.710
 version the first thing I do is itch 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.960
 I put some garlic cloves to fry the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.640
 oil to and should have been less 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 hot because I had no special 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.500
 interest in which to brown and in addition 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.500
 also the same amount of ginger 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.940
 as well we chop ginger see it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.180
 we add and let it sautÃ© a couple of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180
 minutes 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.420
 and while we're going to grate a couple of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.420
 onions and a couple of carrots 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 we add them to the sofrito that happened is 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 quite strong but if you want you can 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 season at this time 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750
 when we have it well poached 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.840
 we pepper the chicken that you see 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.910
 It is boneless and chopped 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.720
 we incorporate let it last a little 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.720
 with the butt fire 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.170
 we add a couple of spoonfuls of curry 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.170
 we are all a little 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 we add the coconut milk and leave it 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.080
 at least 20 minutes 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.050
 while we are going to cook the rice in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.390
 plentiful boiling water with a pinch 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.030
 of salt and we're going with the kind of 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.040
 salad that accompanies this curry in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.710
 principle are all raw ingredients 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540
 or semi raw but I like cabbage 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.430
 that is a little bit cooked and the choi 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 sung which is this other Chinese vegetable 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.200
 also so the other ugly 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.870
 I do it well 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.130
 and I put it in boiling water because it's a 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.130
 couple of minutes 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.800
 and now we're going to add the rest of 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.480
 ingredients that you see is chives 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.480
 this is already well grown 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.900
 a few bean sprouts onion pepper 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.900
 green 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.340
 carrot and some chopped cilantro 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.379
 a little bit of 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.060
 fresh chilli pepper if you want to give it a 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.680
 spicy touch I guess they 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.209
 they will line up differently from parti 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.189
 having extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.189
 which is the best because it aligns it like this 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.450
 and we're going to finish the plate when the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.040
 rice is almost ready to drain it 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.040
 and we incorporate it into curry 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.220
 and we can already serve and I tell you that it is 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.340
 half raw half not and we have the chicken 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.340
 curry 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.470
 and we also add this kind of 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.150
 salad and obviously mixes everything 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.680
 before eating it well I hope that you 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.680
 I liked a hug until then
