here<00:00:05.390> in<00:00:05.569> the<00:00:05.660> first<00:00:05.899> vertical<00:00:06.260> circle<00:00:06.620> method

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
here in the first vertical circle method

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.310 
here in the first vertical circle method
we<00:00:07.490> use<00:00:07.670> holding<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:08.269> ball<00:00:08.450> posture<00:00:09.139> and

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
we use holding the ball posture and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.500 
we use holding the ball posture and
maintain<00:00:10.130> it<00:00:10.309> throughout<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:10.849> whole<00:00:11.000> circle

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
maintain it throughout the whole circle

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.140 
maintain it throughout the whole circle
to<00:00:12.290> do<00:00:12.470> this<00:00:12.680> concentrate<00:00:13.610> your<00:00:13.730> feeling

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
to do this concentrate your feeling

we<00:00:18.470> follow<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.920> same<00:00:19.099> procedure<00:00:19.160> but<00:00:19.849> at<00:00:19.939> the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
we follow the same procedure but at the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.749 
we follow the same procedure but at the
apex<00:00:20.509> of<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.749> circle<00:00:21.140> our<00:00:21.589> wrists<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:22.490> hands

turn<00:00:23.150> over<00:00:25.119> here<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:26.329> the<00:00:26.869> basic<00:00:27.259> method<00:00:27.650> we

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
turn over here in the basic method we

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.239 
turn over here in the basic method we
begin<00:00:28.759> with<00:00:29.060> weight<00:00:29.359> shifts<00:00:29.839> moving<00:00:30.619> forward

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:31.249 
begin with weight shifts moving forward

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.120 
begin with weight shifts moving forward
and<00:00:31.579> moving<00:00:32.180> backward<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:32.950> matching<00:00:33.950> those

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
and moving backward and matching those

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.509 
and moving backward and matching those
was<00:00:34.489> our<00:00:34.640> circle<00:00:35.090> as<00:00:35.989> we<00:00:36.379> go<00:00:36.559> away<00:00:37.129> from<00:00:37.399> our

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.400 
into our body we move forwards this is
the<00:00:42.920> most<00:00:43.100> basic<00:00:43.340> method<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.149> applies<00:00:44.510> to

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
the most basic method and applies to
