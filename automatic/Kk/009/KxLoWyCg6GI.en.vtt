00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.700
 2 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.750
 the line 11 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 Samsung United Nations Fini has one 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.429
 2 megapixel camera here on the back 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.529
 Carmine take on more 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.369
 when the left itself a monologue speaker 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.039
 that is not so interesting every person a mirror for self-portrait 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.940
 and he kept the camera lens as it is again there is none 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.880
 no lightning or similar confusion 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 no no photo lights no money 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.270
 Son Andreas 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 It tastes like Dan Lunt does not really care about a good camera 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.290
 has laid 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.720
 Unfortunately, this also divides so must in the image quality, the two now 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.260
 but first test 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.860
 in addition emails menus 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.000
 and yet for every camera icon 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.310
 the whole is then who can format 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.170
 have one up here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.400
 Shutter is also good 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.270
 per key lets over 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.640
 the camera can be attached to itself "but it can hang well too 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.270
 Camera module it 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.870
 We can first adjust the setting 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.040
 he reckons down here 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.830
 there is the recording mode because there are, for example, the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.060
 the continuous shooting function 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.820
 So within 2 percent 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.510
 of the ideal as a second then percent pictures so does 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 a picture the traction track does not even take a second 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.250
 unfortunately Erhan these pictures then a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.480
 and 10 we had really little use accordingly 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520
 around 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.640
 synonymous, the panorama shot has unfortunately only 640 times 480 pixels 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.530
 at other times 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.320
 You can get here 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.000
 the biggest ones are the biggest ones are Emma 1000 600 times 1000 200 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.570
 pixel 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.090
 which are just under 2 more pixels 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.170
 around and Sgt lively sex with 40 times 480 pixels 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.090
 then with his time 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.950
 I was stuck 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.280
 came 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.830
 Walter Pleite Kaymer cult 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.859
 clicking 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.089
 No there is no obligation incandescent fluorescent tube and cloudy 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.009
 the best result for ten years here 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.479
 In this field the author thereby by Stadtroda that I actually did not find 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.459
 so still separate him why 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.720
 Search function Smudo it and you can quickly check 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.129
 so 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.469
 including one 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.209
 take a picture 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 that's the way to look for it 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.760
 it's about 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.499
 here is the 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.989
 according to Steckel GÃ¼ttler 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.889
 by the way, too 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.239
 very nice percent taxes and also very well satisfiable 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 if you have the photo 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.469
 Yes, that 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.929
 with the not very high quality decorative stripes 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:11.249
 The ears do not have anything to do with the mobile but it is here 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.519
 in our 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.939
 lighting 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.869
 so 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.519
 You can now send this to the cores e-mail or Bluetooth 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.699
 between Kamaz, of course 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.439
 you can use the whole as wallpaper or as a caller image 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.939
 and there are also a few editing functions available 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:32.859
 as 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.859
 Permira photo among them for example 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.549
 additionally offers first 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.959
 seemed earlier 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.959
 because I also want to test the camera 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.189
 and not everyone 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.899
 so and here we have got to work 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.609
 Herwig Seiser settings options 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.659
 So the maximum resolution was unfortunately only 101 76 Merck 144 pixels 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.279
 also there is a timer effects DICE has the same 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.899
 Audio recordings can be switched on and off 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.249
 then you can go out 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.350
 Place around 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.560
 The catch-up of the task criticism should run indefinitely until the memory 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.609
 is full 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.000
 or whether it should be limited to MMS 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.389
 Search function Smolensk video camera fast train TGV and the wars so 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 that you then someone short shots 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.669
 search 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.090
 it's still missing 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.150
 yes and you can see that 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.490
 the brightness can be spanned with the fast movement 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.800
 The chamber is not very clear that is quite blurred on the whole 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.060
 but well as I said the focus is simply not on the camera 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.319
 here 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.409
 You realize that quite clearly, but instead you actually see 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.349
 Jogging with anger in the foreground 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.069
 and they are also very neat that he is still in another video 7 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.619
 with many others also practical so you can take pictures while jogging 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:18.779
 has made 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:22.919
 in order to have individual sessions with the Romandie stored and linked 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.279
 and they will act accordingly and can be filtered like that 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.430
 4 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.830
