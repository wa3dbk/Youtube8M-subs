00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.559
 the highway to finish normally when 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.549
 today I was talking to you about a video I found on the Tibetan tibet 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.550
 affirmation 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.999
 fixi how to make a small detour iphone from 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.239
 a cotton swab 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.119
 it was not necessary if ben ali 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.310
 and in a short time 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.310
 so I first of montreal how it works 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 shaheen jafargholi like 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.690
 very glamorous 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 will belong to my iphone 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 but now there's no problem 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.630
 so here I am for example marked the avenue 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 investigation 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 and you're going to see that it's really working really well 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.890
 very fluid August 26 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.890
 so now we have not tried manufacturing 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.550
 so 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.030
 if you cut% this is a small square the size it is far from our 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.650
 Q-tip 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.830
 in your back of the delhi package 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.230
 you have to surround him 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.190
 but that is known 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 the tourists 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.400
 So here is 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.980
 and now 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.480
 you have to dip a little in the water 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.690
 always keep a point then my future so that it is much more 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.880
 driver actually 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.360
 obama again so stl 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 on the show 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.849
 so that's okay it works nickel 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.919
 and so I also want to show you so on me on the tablet computer have me 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.039
 not new 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.279
 the price of the same principle action 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.279
 So here is 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.089
 who will put back to the place 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.779
 I have marked for example 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.849
 it's excellent 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.849
 a girl 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.169
 a little slow 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 so yes it works great 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 and so I will now show it in comparison 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.419
 scrap 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.779
 so we find in the trade 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.779
 so that's what he taught me that a euro 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.219
 and if we want to write at least align 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.869
 it hangs up believe it's really great 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.849
 not really bad 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.439
 cheney gently 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.439
 but he certainly missed a try by beating points 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.119
 you see earlier 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.689
 by beating at the points 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.349
 wholesale stops the small account also a much better market 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.869
 than the movie cars 2 euros against yvan colonna 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:53.059
 so here is a short video to introduce you to this little trick 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.729
 so to remember a cotton swab fishing m 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:58.499
 and a little late 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.159
 be careful what she's got so we're still a little wet and you 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.159
 have a super tie break is not very glamorous but as far as the eye can see 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.949
 om
