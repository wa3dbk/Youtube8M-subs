00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.070 

how<00:01:31.890> am<00:01:31.980> I<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.159> reviving<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.820> guy<00:01:33.080> I'm

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
how am I not reviving this guy I'm

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.600 
how am I not reviving this guy I'm
obviously<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:34.890> staying<00:01:35.159> there<00:01:35.310> holding

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
obviously I'm staying there holding

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
obviously I'm staying there holding
because<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.120> not<00:01:36.270> reviving<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> didn't<00:01:37.050> show

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
because it's not reviving it didn't show

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.330 
because it's not reviving it didn't show
up<00:01:37.260> but<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.560> thought<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.800> was<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.950> glitched

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
up but I thought it was just glitched

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
up but I thought it was just glitched
like<00:01:38.970> normal<00:01:39.330> because<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.660> game<00:01:39.780> glitches

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
like normal because the game glitches

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830 
like normal because the game glitches
often<00:01:41.150> but<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.300> was<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> case

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
often but that was not to be the case

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480 
often but that was not to be the case
apparently<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.530> wasn't<00:01:43.680> reviving<00:01:44.130> anyone

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
apparently I wasn't reviving anyone

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
apparently I wasn't reviving anyone
that's<00:01:44.700> kind<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:44.970> annoying<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.510> really

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that's kind of annoying there I really

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.290 
that's kind of annoying there I really
thought<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:49.700> gonna<00:01:50.700> jump<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> there

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
thought I was gonna jump out of there

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.080 
thought I was gonna jump out of there
he's<00:01:51.420> gonna<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.660> obviously<00:01:51.930> using<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:53.220> cpg
