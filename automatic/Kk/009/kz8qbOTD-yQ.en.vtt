00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.750 

all<00:02:43.910> right<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.750> based<00:02:45.349> on<00:02:45.560> my<00:02:45.920> observations

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
all right so based on my observations

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.699 
all right so based on my observations
I'd<00:02:46.940> say<00:02:47.150> these<00:02:47.390> Merryweather<00:02:48.110> security

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
I'd say these Merryweather security

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.680 
I'd say these Merryweather security
cocks<00:02:49.160> knots<00:02:49.550> are<00:02:49.849> sitting<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.180> something

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
cocks knots are sitting on something

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.010 
cocks knots are sitting on something
real<00:02:51.050> valuable<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:53.300> they<00:02:53.569> got<00:02:53.750> two<00:02:53.989> of

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
real valuable I think they got two of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.430 
real valuable I think they got two of
these<00:02:54.260> things<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.370> only<00:02:55.670> need<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.440> first

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
these things but we only need one first

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.080 
these things but we only need one first
one<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.520> freighter<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
one is on that freighter in the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.270 
one is on that freighter in the
container<00:02:59.510> below<00:02:59.870> deck<00:03:00.170> they<00:03:00.530> got<00:03:00.680> guards<00:03:00.950> all

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
container below deck they got guards all

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.150 
container below deck they got guards all
over<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.030> ship<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:03.319> likely<00:03:03.709> they're

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
over that ship so it's likely they're

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.600 
over that ship so it's likely they're
keeping<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.880> ice<00:03:05.680> their<00:03:06.680> land<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.370> sea

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
keeping it on ice their land and sea

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.009 
keeping it on ice their land and sea
routes<00:03:07.849> into<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.300> port<00:03:08.510> will<00:03:08.599> be<00:03:08.630> locked<00:03:08.900> down

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
routes into the port will be locked down

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.860 
routes into the port will be locked down
as<00:03:09.319> soon<00:03:09.620> as<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.099> make<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> noise<00:03:10.580> at<00:03:10.880> these<00:03:11.330> X's

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
as soon as we make a noise at these X's

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.020 
as soon as we make a noise at these X's
here<00:03:12.140> which<00:03:12.739> means<00:03:12.980> we<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.640> blow<00:03:13.790> up<00:03:13.819> the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
here which means we have to blow up the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.690 
here which means we have to blow up the
ship<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.510> grab<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.989> thing<00:03:15.019> underwater<00:03:15.980> need

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
ship and grab the thing underwater need

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.220 
ship and grab the thing underwater need
