00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
just depends yeah I can tell when you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.230 
just depends yeah I can tell when you
know<00:01:15.229> when<00:01:15.380> he's<00:01:15.530> down<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.070> when<00:01:16.880> enough<00:01:17.149> is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
know when he's down and when enough is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940 
know when he's down and when enough is
enough<00:01:17.540> yeah<00:01:17.899> I<00:01:18.140> think<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:18.410> went<00:01:18.740> through<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
enough yeah I think we went through the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.580 
enough yeah I think we went through the
first<00:01:19.130> phase<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.030> when<00:01:21.020> he<00:01:21.110> kind<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.380> played

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
first phase and when he kind of played

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.320 
first phase and when he kind of played
through<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.340> came<00:01:22.610> out<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:22.970> that<00:01:23.000> and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
through that and came out of that and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.760 
through that and came out of that and
then<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.479> think<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:23.929> hit<00:01:24.140> with<00:01:24.289> another<00:01:24.320> one

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
then I think it's hit with another one

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.770 
then I think it's hit with another one
until<00:01:25.340> he's<00:01:25.610> down<00:01:25.820> he's<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:26.210> little<00:01:26.509> harder<00:01:26.750> to

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
until he's down he's a little harder to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.419 
until he's down he's a little harder to
overcome<00:01:26.840> we<00:01:27.259> got<00:01:27.380> two<00:01:27.560> big<00:01:27.710> games<00:01:27.920> coming<00:01:28.220> up

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
overcome we got two big games coming up

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.550 
overcome we got two big games coming up
and<00:01:29.149> I<00:01:29.270> went<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:29.630> way<00:01:29.810> nor<00:01:30.050> my<00:01:30.229> what<00:01:30.470> I'm

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
and I went that way nor my what I'm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.660 
and I went that way nor my what I'm
thinking<00:01:30.860> about<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.220> still<00:01:31.490> won't<00:01:31.550> be

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
thinking about it I still won't be

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.249 
thinking about it I still won't be
thinking<00:01:31.789> my<00:01:32.060> short<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:32.720> at<00:01:32.810> least<00:01:32.899> he<00:01:33.080> knows

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
thinking my short but at least he knows

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.380 
thinking my short but at least he knows
that<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.490> also<00:01:34.670> pulled<00:01:35.000> him<00:01:35.119> here<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.330> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.070 
locker room in the world we all got his
back<00:01:39.220> nature<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.580> might<00:01:41.270> must<00:01:41.750> be<00:01:41.899> more

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
back nature is that might must be more

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.889 
back nature is that might must be more
ways<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.289> come<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:42.830> just<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.429> matter<00:01:43.899> yeah

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
ways to come in just a matter yeah

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.180 
ways to come in just a matter yeah
there's<00:01:45.140> no<00:01:45.229> way<00:01:45.319> to<00:01:45.380> prevent<00:01:48.910> every<00:01:49.910> wise
