00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Welcome to the Muse Anti-aging Channel 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.500
 I am William. Dr. Anzeleg, also the chief medical consultant of Muse Global 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.900
 Everyone knows that everyone is actively wanting to live longer and stay young forever. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.600
 All of Muse's products are developed using the most advanced technology to achieve these goals. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.400
 Good science needs a good and simple explanation 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 This is why we decided to broadcast these important health messages as TV shows. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.600
 Make it easier for everyone to understand and achieve the best results 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.200
 There will be new shows every week, so you can watch them on the Muse website. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.200
 At the same time, you can share it with friends, customers and team partners. 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 Please take the time to watch and enjoy the content of our program and share it with more people who need it! 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.200
 Welcome to the first episode of the Muse Anti-Ageive Channel 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 We are a young generation of Muse, and I am also a part of the younger generation! 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 The so-called young generation, the word "young" is spoken from my mouth, and I am a bit conceited. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.400
 I am 72 years old and you will find that I am definitely not a special case of regaining youth. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 Let me explain to you 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 Generation Young is a new way of life, a new anti-aging trend based on scientific evidence 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 Not long ago, we were still convinced that aging is the result of natural occurrence as time goes by. 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 Death is also the inevitable result of organ aging 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 The function of the human body will also decline with aging 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 This is the invariable law of the passage of time. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.400
 We also turn life into a linear timeline 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 Decide when we should retire and decide when to be an old man! 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.400
 Today, science has proven that aging is not related to the accumulation of years, but the result of damage to cells. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:59.500
 Our lives and longevity are in the tiny and amazing space of cells. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 The human body has at least 60 trillion almost identical cells, and our ability to survive and maintain health 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Rely on the health of the cells, including the nucleus 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.600
 DNA, mitochondria and cytoplasm 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.600
 This new perspective on life has dramatically changed our perception of health. 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.600
 For our younger generation 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.600
 Aging is the immediate result of damage to cells, especially DNA. 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 However, the most important aspect of the young generation 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:01.800
 We are convinced that we are witnessing an unimaginable technological tsunami, whether we are involved or just watching 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:13.800
 Genomics, gene therapy, stem cells, and nanomedicine will profoundly reshape our relationship with the world. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 There will be amazing changes in delaying aging and death, thanks to the scientistsâ€™ "concentration technology". 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.300
 That is, the integration of nanomedicine, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science into a new field of science and technology. 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:47.300
 The future change will be the ultimate transcendence, whether it is scale or speed, which is unprecedented in all mankind. 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:57.400
 I mean the DNA sequence is to revolutionize the medical revolution by interpreting billions of messages within the genetic makeup. 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.400
 The understanding of each of our genetic traits is the foundation of future personalized medicine. 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 Think about it... the healing of the body will reach the level of the cell 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 And soon, nanotechnology will enable us to build and repair cell molecules, right, repair molecules and atoms! 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:42.400
 This is the "young generation"! I believe that today's science will not stop treating diseases or simply treating lives. 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.400
 We want to feel young, and the sooner the better! 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.500
 We want to keep our thoughts clear, and the sooner the better! 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Let love last forever, share the joy of family with our generations and grandchildren, and realize our dreams. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.500
 Muse is one of the few companies to extend their life and maintain health with cutting-edge technology. 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:25.500
 The mission of Muse is to bring beauty and hope to the world by establishing a sound product system. 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.500
 Muse's Cell Optimization Management System 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:38.500
 It is a complete product line that fully focuses on the nutrients, DNA repair and vitality needed by younger generations. 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:50.500
 We are Muse, we are younger generations, thank you for watching, I hope to see you next time!
