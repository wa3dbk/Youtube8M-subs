00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
going to have to get under the seat and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.470 
going to have to get under the seat and
change<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.160> load<00:02:19.340> equalizer<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.270> can

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
change the load equalizer so you can

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.199 
change the load equalizer so you can
actually<00:02:20.630> run<00:02:20.989> these<00:02:21.550> panacea<00:02:22.550> light<00:02:22.790> system

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
actually run these panacea light system

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.030 
actually run these panacea light system
comes<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.780> master<00:02:24.200> control<00:02:24.560> unit<00:02:24.890> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
comes with this master control unit that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.710 
comes with this master control unit that
plugs<00:02:25.280> right<00:02:25.520> into<00:02:25.730> your<00:02:25.910> stock<00:02:26.209> wiring

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
plugs right into your stock wiring

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.510 
plugs right into your stock wiring
harness<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.500> also<00:02:27.709> comes<00:02:28.100> with<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.340> load

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
harness it also comes with a load

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.880 
harness it also comes with a load
equalizer<00:02:29.020> however<00:02:30.020> on<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.350> bike<00:02:30.590> with<00:02:30.770> an

alarm<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.330> use<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.600> different<00:02:32.630> load

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
alarm we have to use a different load

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.449 
alarm we have to use a different load
equalizer<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.090> comes<00:02:35.270> with<00:02:35.540> it

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
equalizer so the one that comes with it

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.590 
equalizer so the one that comes with it
