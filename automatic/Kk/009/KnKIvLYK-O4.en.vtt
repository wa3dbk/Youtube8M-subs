a<00:01:57.119> half<00:01:58.079> minor<00:01:58.860> half<00:01:59.310> major<00:01:59.640> chords<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.420> it's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
a half minor half major chords so it's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.170 
a half minor half major chords so it's
used<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> substitute<00:02:01.710> both<00:02:02.159> both<00:02:02.640> major<00:02:02.970> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
used to substitute both both major and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
used to substitute both both major and
minor<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.320> gonna<00:02:04.409> add<00:02:04.560> another

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
minor now I'm just gonna add another

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.120

higher octave G both are considered a

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.339 
higher octave G both are considered a
7th<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.540> dominant<00:02:22.110> 7th<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:25.080> create

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
7th a dominant 7th but I can create

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.350 
7th a dominant 7th but I can create
color<00:02:25.650> by<00:02:26.519> emphasizing<00:02:27.360> my<00:02:27.690> 7th<00:02:28.260> right<00:02:29.360> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
color by emphasizing my 7th right and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.360 
color by emphasizing my 7th right and
integrate<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.260> into<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.620> rhythm<00:02:37.100> I'm<00:02:38.100> gonna<00:02:38.250> do

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
integrate it into my rhythm I'm gonna do

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.330 
integrate it into my rhythm I'm gonna do
one<00:02:38.549> more<00:02:38.580> thing<00:02:39.290> I'm<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.440> take<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.830> 7th

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
one more thing I'm gonna take that 7th

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.240 
one more thing I'm gonna take that 7th
and<00:02:41.459> move<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.670> down<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:42.239> fret<00:02:42.860> same<00:02:43.860> string

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and move it down one fret same string

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.630 
and move it down one fret same string
and<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> major<00:02:45.780> six<00:02:46.260> I'm<00:02:47.250> still

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and that is a major six I'm still

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.870 
and that is a major six I'm still
technically<00:02:48.390> playing<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> 7th<00:02:49.530> chord

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
technically playing the a 7th chord

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.440 
technically playing the a 7th chord
because<00:02:50.880> I've<00:02:51.720> got<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.110> 7th<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.190> G

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
because I've got the 7th here in the G

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.570 
because I've got the 7th here in the G
and<00:02:54.450> when<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> add<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.260> pinky<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.220> has<00:02:56.400> an

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
and when I add the pinky it has an

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.759 
and when I add the pinky it has an
octave<00:02:56.940> higher<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> haven't<00:02:58.019> changed

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
octave higher but I haven't changed

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.580 
octave higher but I haven't changed
I<00:02:58.799> haven't<00:02:59.580> taken<00:02:59.790> away<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.900> 7th<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.470> my

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
I haven't taken away the 7th on my

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.220 
I haven't taken away the 7th on my
fourth<00:03:01.859> string<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.489> added<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.910> major<00:03:03.120> 6<00:03:03.570> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
fourth string I just added a major 6 so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.270 
fourth string I just added a major 6 so
technically<00:03:04.739> this<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.700> an<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:06.150> dominant<00:03:06.780> 7th

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
technically this is an a dominant 7th

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.020 
technically this is an a dominant 7th
plus<00:03:08.810> 6<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.410> that's<00:03:10.530> major<00:03:10.859> 6<00:03:12.170> very<00:03:13.170> jazzy<00:03:14.030> but

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
plus 6 and that's major 6 very jazzy but

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.090 
plus 6 and that's major 6 very jazzy but
sounds<00:03:15.450> really<00:03:15.810> great<00:03:16.019> going<00:03:16.380> back<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.829> forth

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
sounds really great going back and forth

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:29.449 
sounds really great going back and forth
from<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.489> 7th<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.890> 6th<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:28.190> it's<00:03:29.190> quite

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
from the 7th to the 6th and it's quite

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.160 
from the 7th to the 6th and it's quite
movable<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.209> know<00:03:30.329> your<00:03:30.450> next<00:03:30.690> change<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.049> be

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
movable you know your next change to be

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.440 
movable you know your next change to be
d

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.089 

that's<00:03:37.450> not<00:03:37.690> saying<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.170> have<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.349> substitute

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
that's not saying you have to substitute

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.809 
that's not saying you have to substitute
for<00:03:40.440> each<00:03:41.440> chord<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.160> might<00:03:42.310> just<00:03:42.519> choose<00:03:42.670> to

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
for each chord you might just choose to

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.119 
for each chord you might just choose to
do<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.090> in<00:03:43.450> one<00:03:43.690> chord<00:03:44.050> then<00:03:44.590> we<00:03:44.680> go<00:03:44.800> back<00:03:44.950> to
