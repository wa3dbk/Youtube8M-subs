00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.910
 everything about the theme oven and whole 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.590
 especially cleanse and wanted now 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.699
 I'll ask you or you 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.900
 ask for your help 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.600
 maybe you have somehow 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.120
 budget tips or any tips 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.769
 from the grandma that gave you this 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.290
 we get the best oven 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.640
 clean again or a baking sheet what 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.739
 Do you, for example, if you completely 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.180
 many fat splashes in the oven have that 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.710
 one knows well the times leftovers 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.420
 fall down and burn in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.460
 what her the oven or sour acid 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 you buy each new is also 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.879
 In any case, it will be fun for me 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.500
 interested in what you have tips for it 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.239
 and for tricks you can and you can 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.400
 Just send me a message 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.619
 By the way, you can also write me 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.479
 or send a video in the photo 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.130
 send what you for example times 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.869
 is really bizarre with your oven 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.790
 So you can not only do that 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.950
 to use the murat for baking 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.450
 example is very cool story of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.370
 used the oven and his mobile phone 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.380
 to dry because that's before 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.820
 so please do not ask me how and 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.170
 why but it was before that on the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 Toilet Rhine seen the toilet 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.360
 go in and then a little more 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.920
 but unfortunately it worked and he was wet 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.240
 of course wanted to dry because he heard 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 then work again 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.960
 and because he just did not have enough time 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 Just had used it in the oven afterwards 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.930
 which is broken here, of course 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.000
 please do not imitate but maybe 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.530
 Do you have such stories where he 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.150
 Something says you just have the oven 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.320
 sometimes misused and something completely 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.210
 bizarre is done with it 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.770
 In any case, I would be happy 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.570
 if you have some tips for me 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.520
 especially to clean any 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.440
 budget tips then you can like me 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.909

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.830
 also send photos or just as 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.510

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.000

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.500
 Agree on your feedback and I say 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.330

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.690
 consignment check in the yard is running 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.979
