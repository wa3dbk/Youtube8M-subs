00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.790
 sexual attractiveness what makes us 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.619
 sexy to the opposite sex I like this 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.390
 it turns out that it has to do with aromas not 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.789
 it has to do with neither body nor face 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.800
 or with money, that is, the exercises 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.880
 but money substances put into the body 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.159
 for great this spectacular 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.720
 increase sexual attractiveness through 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.579
 of something else this is the trick now 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.220
 women very careful if they are taking 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.560
 hormonal breaks stability for 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.620
 identify that one angelic 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.330
 of the gentleman who is his counterpart 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.280
 genetic because look at the aroma 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.140
 looks for genetic counterparts to join 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.880
 that complement each other then when there 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.620
 a hormonal treatment is altered by 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.180
 that part we're going to see if there are no hormones 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.420
 there is not something else so first we have 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.140
 we fill our gasoline tank 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.120
 of four and these foods increase 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.010
 production or make adequate the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.140
 production of hormones so they are 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.050
 very pleasant or very low begin with 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.160
 the law 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.560
 It turns out that a spoonful of flaxseed 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.540
 it has enough complex for it to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.310
 you increase the production of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 testosterone and testosterone is the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.110
 hormone passion for excellence both 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.270
 for men as for women and that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 when we need a spoonful a day 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.220
 whether it's that salad or its fruit 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 start today motivation 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.580
 because they are ready for day 14 on 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.320
 metal from the gasoline to the body from the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.760
 another gasoline honey bee is 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.230
 awesome honey bees on 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.170
 everything for women contains boron and 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.640
 this regulates the estrogen cycle because 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 if there is excess estrogen then already 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 there is no passion so honey bee 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 at night it helps both men but 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.550
 especially women and also we 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.770
 word for cramps but the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.330
 cramps and when we look at complexes and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.280
 also a good complex and gives energy 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.100
 so daily a banana from here 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.870
 story 14 and also take about 22 hours 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.890

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.960
 Italian women who are very 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.170

 important has two amino acids that 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.890
 increase passion now we talk about 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.590
 humors which is what attracts women 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.420
 webber colonies smelling moss 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.150

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.250
 women to attract men ok 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.280
 then the man is attracted by cinnamon 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.140
 and for the band and an important this of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.420
 the band because it turns out that lavender 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.330
 can increase blood flow the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.760
 genitals up to 40% much better 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.010
 that viagra and finally although we're going 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.470
 to impose the accelerator track 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.430
 because it turns out that the ginger if 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.930
 we 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.359
 we smell 'free fresh 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.739

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.640
 genitalia in both men and women 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.250
 women 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.590
 and this is going to make obviously the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.870
 moment of sexual action in the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.549
 sexual response to much more intense 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.200

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.359
 pride so that there is no lack of passion in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.430
