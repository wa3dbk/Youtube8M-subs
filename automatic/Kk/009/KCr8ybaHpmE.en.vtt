you have a joystick I recommend doing

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120 
you have a joystick I recommend doing
that<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> d-pad<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> bad<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that because the d-pad is kind of bad so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.350

which<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:15.120> -<00:02:15.860> yes<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.190> game<00:02:17.370> has<00:02:17.490> a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
which is in - yes this game has a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
which is in - yes this game has a
spinach<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.060> wondered<00:02:18.420> how<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.630> could<00:02:18.780> leave

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
spinach I wondered how they could leave

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.840 
spinach I wondered how they could leave
it<00:02:18.990> out<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.800> can<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.100> jump<00:02:20.990> tell<00:02:21.990> me<00:02:22.080> that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
it out so you can do a jump tell me that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.240 
it out so you can do a jump tell me that
or<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.480> use<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:26.100> is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
or you can use this and I think this is

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.009 
or you can use this and I think this is
the<00:02:26.340> B<00:02:26.459> button<00:02:26.640> by<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.850> way<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.269> think<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the B button by the way I think the

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.390 
the B button by the way I think the
reason<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.350> he<00:02:28.530> didn't<00:02:28.739> mention<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.220> is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
reason that he didn't mention this is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.210 
reason that he didn't mention this is
actually<00:02:29.820> because<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.350> doesn't<00:02:31.680> really

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
actually because it's it doesn't really

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.340 
actually because it's it doesn't really
look<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.790> decently<00:02:33.480> bunk<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.080> doesn't

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
look that decently bunk and it doesn't

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.979 
look that decently bunk and it doesn't
use<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> sound<00:02:34.830> effect<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.060> spin<00:02:36.450> -<00:02:36.600> or<00:02:36.750> did

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
use a sound effect like I spin - or did

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:37.640 
use a sound effect like I spin - or did

as you can see you move forward and he

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
as you can see you move forward and he
gives<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> momentum<00:02:46.040> now<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.370> didn't<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.330> him

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
gives you momentum now I didn't see him

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
gives you momentum now I didn't see him

bump in the ground it would actually

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.660

actually<00:04:09.590> just<00:04:10.069> opened<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.790> just<00:04:10.970> checked

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
actually just opened it and just checked

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.810 
actually just opened it and just checked
it<00:04:11.300> out<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:11.870> when<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.530> noticed<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.980> spin<00:04:13.220> -<00:04:13.430> and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
it out but when I noticed the spin - and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.760 
it out but when I noticed the spin - and
I<00:04:14.270> noticed<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.020> could<00:04:15.110> capture<00:04:15.560> some

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
I noticed that I could capture some

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.500 
I noticed that I could capture some
pretty<00:04:16.040> nice<00:04:16.190> gameplay<00:04:16.669> from<00:04:16.730> that<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.150> decided

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
pretty nice gameplay from that I decided

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.460 
pretty nice gameplay from that I decided
that<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.840> should<00:04:17.950> make<00:04:18.950> another<00:04:18.980> video

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.640

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
so as you can see my post is a lot of

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.620 
so as you can see my post is a lot of
variety<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.009> it<00:04:27.130> there's<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:28.210> part<00:04:28.449> of<00:04:28.509> you

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
variety to it there's this part of you

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.260 
variety to it there's this part of you
which<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.840> jumping<00:04:34.979> for<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.130> over<00:04:37.030> here<00:04:37.180> is

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
which is jumping for that over here is

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.370 
which is jumping for that over here is
an<00:04:37.330> extra<00:04:37.569> life<00:04:39.240> plays<00:04:40.240> about<00:04:40.419> half<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.229> that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
an extra life plays about half of that

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.100 
an extra life plays about half of that
same<00:04:41.590> thing<00:04:44.310> as<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.490> see<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.639> dieted<00:04:46.120> so

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
same thing as you see I dieted so

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.659 
same thing as you see I dieted so
basically<00:04:47.560> that's<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.460> want<00:04:48.610> to

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
basically that's that I just want to

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.830 
basically that's that I just want to
show<00:04:48.759> that<00:04:48.789> off<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.150> pause<00:04:49.360> screen<00:04:49.389> is<00:04:49.720> also

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
show that off the pause screen is also

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.600 
show that off the pause screen is also
very<00:04:50.440> reminiscent<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.949> actual<00:04:51.400> science

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
very reminiscent of actual science

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.149 
very reminiscent of actual science
adventure<00:04:52.139> but<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.169> just<00:04:53.470> want<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.680> show<00:04:53.800> up<00:04:53.949> you

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
there on the background this thing came

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.600 
there on the background this thing came
out<00:05:03.550> in<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:03.909> year<00:05:03.940> 2000<00:05:04.919> and<00:05:05.919> it<00:05:06.069> was<00:05:06.159> released

are<00:05:09.130> actually<00:05:09.430> other<00:05:09.460> games<00:05:09.909> in<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.120> series<00:05:10.210> -

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
are actually other games in the series -

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.999 
are actually other games in the series -
I<00:05:11.440> believe<00:05:12.130> that<00:05:12.190> Tony<00:05:12.520> USA<00:05:13.500> Hydro<00:05:14.500> Thunder<00:05:14.530> a

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
I believe that Tony USA Hydro Thunder a

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.999 
I believe that Tony USA Hydro Thunder a
lot<00:05:15.190> of<00:05:15.310> Dreamcast<00:05:15.759> launch<00:05:16.000> titles<00:05:16.449> and

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
lot of Dreamcast launch titles and

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.710 
lot of Dreamcast launch titles and
honestly<00:05:18.009> if<00:05:18.280> they're<00:05:18.610> if<00:05:18.759> they<00:05:19.090> have<00:05:19.300> half<00:05:19.569> as

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
honestly if they're if they have half as

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.070 
honestly if they're if they have half as
much<00:05:19.840> effort<00:05:20.050> as<00:05:20.259> this<00:05:20.440> game<00:05:20.680> then<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:22.080> would

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
much effort as this game then I would

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.189 
much effort as this game then I would
love<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.740> check<00:05:23.889> those<00:05:24.099> out<00:05:24.870> quickly<00:05:25.870> get<00:05:26.110> it

out of the way I paid quite a bit for
this<00:05:29.139> quite<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.680> bit<00:05:29.830> more<00:05:29.979> than<00:05:30.159> it<00:05:30.250> was

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
this quite a bit more than it was

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.360 
this quite a bit more than it was
actually<00:05:30.759> worth<00:05:30.969> but<00:05:31.599> I<00:05:31.630> will<00:05:31.900> say<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.409> I<00:05:33.130> am

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
actually worth but I will say that I am

sonic ventures publi my favorite sonic
game<00:05:42.599> that<00:05:43.599> is<00:05:43.780> actually<00:05:44.110> decent<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:44.800> think

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
game that is actually decent and I think

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.279 
game that is actually decent and I think
it<00:05:45.159> really<00:05:45.849> does<00:05:46.060> justice<00:05:46.509> to<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.750> game<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.229> I

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
it really does justice to the game and I

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.629 
it really does justice to the game and I
think<00:05:47.530> if<00:05:47.800> this<00:05:47.979> had<00:05:48.130> been<00:05:48.159> released<00:05:48.490> on

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
think if this had been released on

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.709 
think if this had been released on
something<00:05:48.909> like<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.120> game<00:05:49.300> here<00:05:49.539> with<00:05:49.690> a

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
something like the game here with a

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.649 
something like the game here with a
little<00:05:49.960> bit<00:05:50.139> more<00:05:50.259> power<00:05:50.500> in<00:05:50.680> America<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:52.449> it

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
little bit more power in America that it

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.790 
little bit more power in America that it
would<00:05:52.780> have<00:05:52.870> actually<00:05:52.990> been<00:05:53.259> one<00:05:53.590> of<00:05:53.650> the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
would have actually been one of the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.050 
would have actually been one of the
better<00:05:53.919> sonic<00:05:54.310> games<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.669> probably<00:05:54.940> one<00:05:55.030> of

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
better sonic games and probably one of

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.540 
better sonic games and probably one of
the<00:05:55.180> best<00:05:55.330> handheld<00:05:55.599> Sonic<00:05:56.110> games<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:57.310> course

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
the best handheld Sonic games of course

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.680 
the best handheld Sonic games of course
with<00:05:57.699> a<00:05:57.729> little<00:05:57.940> bit<00:05:58.030> more<00:05:58.150> power<00:05:58.389> than<00:05:58.659> a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
with a little bit more power than a

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.309 
with a little bit more power than a
tiger<00:05:59.669> electronics<00:06:00.669> game<00:06:00.909> but<00:06:01.780> it<00:06:01.990> was<00:06:02.110> going

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
tiger electronics game but it was going

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.570 
tiger electronics game but it was going
in<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.500> right<00:06:02.590> direction<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.190> I<00:06:03.219> think<00:06:03.250> it's

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
in the right direction and I think it's

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.430 
in the right direction and I think it's
excellent<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:04.539> it's<00:06:04.960> interesting<00:06:05.229> because

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
excellent and it's interesting because

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.379 
excellent and it's interesting because
this<00:06:05.830> can<00:06:06.099> that<00:06:06.280> now<00:06:06.430> actually<00:06:06.819> probably<00:06:07.030> be

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
this can that now actually probably be

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.870 
this can that now actually probably be
considered<00:06:07.539> the<00:06:07.900> first<00:06:08.199> handheld<00:06:08.949> 3d<00:06:09.550> Sonic

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
considered the first handheld 3d Sonic

game so
that's<00:06:12.289> interesting<00:06:12.889> and<00:06:13.099> that's<00:06:13.159> very<00:06:13.460> cool

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870
