lens on it and i have it mounted to this
little<00:00:16.560> flying<00:00:16.949> wing<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.430> that's<00:00:17.609> made<00:00:17.760> out

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
little flying wing here that's made out

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.410 
little flying wing here that's made out
of<00:00:18.090> foam<00:00:18.859> over<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.730> fox<00:00:21.060> tech

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
of foam over here we have the fox tech

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.550 
of foam over here we have the fox tech
500<00:00:22.080> milliwatts<00:00:22.529> 4<00:00:23.189> gigahertz<00:00:23.460> transmitter

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
500 milliwatts 4 gigahertz transmitter

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.820 
500 milliwatts 4 gigahertz transmitter
and<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:26.010> are<00:00:26.160> using<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:27.109> UHF<00:00:28.109> system<00:00:28.500> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and we are using a UHF system for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.140 
and we are using a UHF system for
control<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.820> take<00:00:30.000> this

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
control so we're going to take this

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
control so we're going to take this
plane<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> field<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> fly<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
plane out to the field and fly it and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459 
plane out to the field and fly it and
see<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> camera<00:00:33.059> performs<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.930> its

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
see how the camera performs in its

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.569 
see how the camera performs in its
natural<00:00:34.620> environment

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:50.850 

I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.979 

the<00:00:51.860> sky<00:00:52.239> look<00:00:53.239> look<00:00:53.540> what<00:00:53.690> he's<00:00:53.780> doing<00:00:53.960> now

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the sky look look what he's doing now

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.549 
the sky look look what he's doing now
he's<00:00:54.200> doing<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.440> low<00:00:54.590> fly<00:00:54.890> look<00:00:55.579> see<00:00:56.390> watch<00:00:57.350> it

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
he's doing a low fly look see watch it

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.710 
he's doing a low fly look see watch it
like<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.860> compose<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.400> so<00:00:58.790> here's<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.540> video

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
like to compose it so here's the video

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.770 
like to compose it so here's the video
from<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.290> plane<00:01:00.739> on<00:01:01.180> recorded<00:01:02.180> on<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.360> ground

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
from the plane on recorded on the ground

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.760 
from the plane on recorded on the ground
so<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:03.949> video<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.400> being<00:01:04.729> transmitted<00:01:05.540> on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
so this video is being transmitted on

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.830 
so this video is being transmitted on
the<00:01:06.770> colors<00:01:07.130> are<00:01:07.490> not<00:01:07.729> adjusted<00:01:08.300> on<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.600> video

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
the colors are not adjusted on the video

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.630 
the colors are not adjusted on the video
clips<00:01:09.080> at<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.740> exactly<00:01:10.040> how<00:01:10.250> they

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
clips at all this is exactly how they

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.080 
clips at all this is exactly how they
came<00:01:10.970> from<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.420> plane<00:01:11.650> from<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.710> camera<00:01:13.220> as

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
came from the plane from the camera as

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.090 
came from the plane from the camera as
you<00:01:14.150> can<00:01:14.540> see<00:01:14.810> there<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:15.140> some<00:01:15.440> interlacing

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
you can see there is some interlacing

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.609 
you can see there is some interlacing
going<00:01:16.369> on<00:01:16.490> which<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.390> why<00:01:17.659> when<00:01:18.259> there's<00:01:18.409> a<00:01:18.470> lot

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
going on which is why when there's a lot

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.260 
going on which is why when there's a lot
of<00:01:18.650> motion<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.250> may<00:01:19.399> appear<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.729> little<00:01:19.820> blurry

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
of motion it may appear a little blurry

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.109 
of motion it may appear a little blurry
sometimes<00:01:20.780> that's<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.320> my<00:01:21.560> recorder<00:01:22.130> on<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
sometimes that's just my recorder on the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.359 
sometimes that's just my recorder on the
interlaces<00:01:23.660> it's<00:01:23.899> not<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.200> camera<00:01:24.649> but

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
interlaces it's not the camera but

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.040 
interlaces it's not the camera but
anyways<00:01:25.670> as<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:25.940> can<00:01:26.090> see<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.450> colors<00:01:26.810> are

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
anyways as you can see the colors are

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.980 
anyways as you can see the colors are
really<00:01:27.320> good<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.580> never<00:01:28.820> adjusts<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
really good and it never adjusts to the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.960 
really good and it never adjusts to the
brightness<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.649> sky<00:01:30.979> mainly<00:01:31.670> because<00:01:31.789> I'm

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
brightness of the sky mainly because I'm

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.490 
brightness of the sky mainly because I'm
not<00:01:32.090> really<00:01:32.330> pointed<00:01:32.750> at<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.960> sky<00:01:33.050> most<00:01:33.410> of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
not really pointed at the sky most of

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.590 
not really pointed at the sky most of
the<00:01:33.560> time<00:01:33.800> but<00:01:34.039> even<00:01:34.729> if<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:34.940> was<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.479> would

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the time but even if I was it would

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.630 
the time but even if I was it would
still<00:01:35.840> only<00:01:36.590> adjust<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.220> lightness<00:01:37.580> of

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
still only adjust to the lightness of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.160 
still only adjust to the lightness of
the<00:01:37.700> ground<00:01:38.030> which<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.360> really<00:01:38.660> good<00:01:38.899> so<00:01:39.080> you

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the ground which is really good so you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.499 
the ground which is really good so you
can<00:01:39.320> always<00:01:39.470> see<00:01:39.710> where<00:01:39.830> you're<00:01:39.979> going<00:01:40.009> on<00:01:40.509> and

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
can always see where you're going on and

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.690 
can always see where you're going on and
the<00:01:42.410> camera<00:01:42.710> shoots<00:01:42.890> out<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.039> good<00:01:43.250> frame<00:01:43.490> rate

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the camera shoots out a good frame rate

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700 
the camera shoots out a good frame rate
it's<00:01:43.940> good<00:01:44.330> for<00:01:44.780> when<00:01:44.990> when<00:01:45.350> there's<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.560> lot<00:01:45.679> of

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
it's good for when when there's a lot of

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.560 
it's good for when when there's a lot of
motion<00:01:45.979> going<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:46.850> can<00:01:47.030> clearly<00:01:47.300> see

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
motion going on you can clearly see

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.719 
motion going on you can clearly see
everything<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.830> resolution<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.429> great

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
everything on the resolution is great

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.309 
everything on the resolution is great
there's<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.390> big<00:01:50.600> difference<00:01:50.840> from<00:01:51.140> other

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
there's a big difference from other

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.180 
there's a big difference from other
cameras<00:01:52.899> compared<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.590> camera<00:01:55.039> when

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
cameras compared to this camera when

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.800 
cameras compared to this camera when
you're<00:01:55.340> looking<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.849> video<00:01:56.119> goggles<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
you're looking in the video goggles you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.480 
you're looking in the video goggles you
can<00:01:56.990> definitely<00:01:57.200> tell<00:01:57.440> where<00:01:57.979> you're<00:01:58.130> going

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
can definitely tell where you're going

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.880 
can definitely tell where you're going
what's<00:01:58.729> going<00:01:58.819> on<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.149> lot<00:01:59.390> better<00:01:59.539> on<00:01:59.890> overall

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
what's going on a lot better on overall

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.800 
what's going on a lot better on overall
I'm<00:02:01.160> just<00:02:01.310> really<00:02:01.729> impressed<00:02:02.420> with<00:02:02.660> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
I'm just really impressed with the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.169 
I'm just really impressed with the
quality<00:02:02.959> of<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.349> camera<00:02:03.800> once<00:02:04.789> again<00:02:05.060> this

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
quality of this camera once again this

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.199 
quality of this camera once again this
is<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.390> stock<00:02:05.959> lens<00:02:06.319> so<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.550> not<00:02:07.640> as<00:02:07.970> wide

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
is the stock lens so it's not as wide

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.719 
is the stock lens so it's not as wide
angle<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.020> lens<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.619> usually<00:02:10.130> use<00:02:10.340> but

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
angle is the lens that I usually use but

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.190 
angle is the lens that I usually use but
I'm<00:02:10.940> going<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.150> keep<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.450> lens<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:11.900> just

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
I'm going to keep this lens on it just

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.620 
I'm going to keep this lens on it just
because<00:02:12.290> without<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.700> lenses<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.569> are

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
because without the lenses that are

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.390 
because without the lenses that are
super<00:02:15.080> wide<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.620> kind<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.950> see<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> little

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
super wide you can kind of see a little

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.729 
super wide you can kind of see a little
bit<00:02:16.520> farther<00:02:16.819> into<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.440> distance<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.620> you

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
bit farther into the distance and you

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.490 
bit farther into the distance and you
can<00:02:18.860> also<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.370> things<00:02:19.849> with<00:02:20.150> better<00:02:20.500> clarity

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
can also see things with better clarity

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.320 
can also see things with better clarity
like<00:02:21.739> there<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> telephone<00:02:22.670> wire<00:02:23.000> or

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
like there is a telephone wire or

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.550 
like there is a telephone wire or
something<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.780> would<00:02:23.989> you'd<00:02:24.110> be<00:02:24.260> able<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.470> see

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
something you would you'd be able to see

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.370 
something you would you'd be able to see
it<00:02:24.770> more<00:02:24.920> easily<00:02:25.720> telephone<00:02:26.720> wires<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
it more easily telephone wires can be a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.229 
it more easily telephone wires can be a
big<00:02:27.590> issue<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:28.099> your<00:02:28.190> flying<00:02:28.430> fpv<00:02:28.940> I've<00:02:29.060> had

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
big issue in your flying fpv I've had

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.690 
big issue in your flying fpv I've had
some<00:02:29.450> really<00:02:29.629> close<00:02:29.930> calls<00:02:30.230> with<00:02:30.470> those<00:02:30.739> but

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
some really close calls with those but

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
some really close calls with those but
anyways<00:02:32.180> as<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:33.349> see<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.709> camera

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
anyways as you can see the camera

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.089 
anyways as you can see the camera
performs<00:02:34.580> brilliantly<00:02:35.360> um<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> little

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
performs brilliantly um it is a little

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.190 
performs brilliantly um it is a little
heavy<00:02:37.340> for<00:02:37.430> such<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.819> small<00:02:38.420> plane<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.020> this

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
heavy for such a small plane like this

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.290 
heavy for such a small plane like this
but<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.770> plane<00:02:39.980> actually<00:02:40.220> carries<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> fun<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
but the plane actually carries a fun and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.119 
but the plane actually carries a fun and
it's<00:02:41.450> really<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:42.379> with<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.770> word<00:02:42.920> it's

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
it's really it's with the word it's

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.430 
it's really it's with the word it's
worth<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> wait<00:02:43.489> because<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.450> encased<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.349> a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
worth the wait because it's encased in a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.220 
worth the wait because it's encased in a
hard<00:02:45.709> metal<00:02:46.220> case<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:47.030> really<00:02:47.420> makes<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.140> a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
hard metal case that really makes it a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.990 
hard metal case that really makes it a
lot<00:02:48.349> more<00:02:48.410> durable<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.340> were<00:02:49.489> to

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
lot more durable so if I were to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.670 
lot more durable so if I were to
nosedive<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.720> plane<00:02:50.959> I'm<00:02:51.140> sure<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> camera

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
nosedive this plane I'm sure the camera

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.010 
nosedive this plane I'm sure the camera
would<00:02:51.770> be<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:52.190> fine<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.239> anyways<00:02:53.780> that's

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
would be just fine so anyways that's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.860 
would be just fine so anyways that's
some<00:02:55.010> flight<00:02:55.280> video<00:02:55.579> from<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.209> camera<00:02:56.480> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
some flight video from this camera and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.630 
some flight video from this camera and
I'll<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.500> keep<00:02:57.680> playing<00:02:57.859> the<00:02:58.069> video<00:02:58.189> and<00:02:58.549> you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
I'll just keep playing the video and you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.240 
I'll just keep playing the video and you
can<00:02:58.849> check<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.299> out

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.490 

also<00:03:03.240> for<00:03:03.540> those<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.020> who<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.440> know

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
also for those of you who want to know

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.800 
also for those of you who want to know
more<00:03:04.620> information<00:03:05.220> about<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.790> plane<00:03:06.090> you'll

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
more information about this plane you'll

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.930 
more information about this plane you'll
have<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.110> wait<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> couple<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.680> weeks<00:03:07.940> because

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
have to wait a couple of weeks because

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.190 
have to wait a couple of weeks because
I'm<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.600> take<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.050> different

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I'm going to take it to different

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.950 
I'm going to take it to different
locations<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.340> fly<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> bunch<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.630> then<00:03:12.690> get<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
locations and fly a bunch and then get a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.350 
locations and fly a bunch and then get a
bunch<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.350> footage<00:03:13.560> from<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.790> then

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
bunch of footage from it on and then

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.970 
bunch of footage from it on and then
they'll<00:03:15.480> put<00:03:15.690> kind<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.170> compilation<00:03:16.500> video

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
they'll put kind of a compilation video

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.160 
they'll put kind of a compilation video
together<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.210> that<00:03:18.360> video<00:03:18.570> get<00:03:18.959> more

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
together and in that video get more

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:29.530 
together and in that video get more
specs<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.830> plane<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.400> stuff<00:03:21.240> like<00:03:21.390> that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:59.620 

you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.500 

so<00:04:00.320> right<00:04:00.950> on<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.190> nose<00:04:01.370> at<00:04:01.580> play

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
so right on the nose at play

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.380 
so right on the nose at play
he<00:04:02.930> said<00:04:03.189> he's<00:04:04.189> flying<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.730> from<00:04:05.060> being<00:04:05.209> on

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
he said he's flying it from being on

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.700 
he said he's flying it from being on
board<00:04:05.599> right<00:04:05.750> now

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.940 

he's<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> dog<00:04:10.760> chasing<00:04:11.470> he<00:04:12.470> thinks<00:04:12.740> it's<00:04:12.860> a

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
he's a dog chasing he thinks it's a

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:26.410 
he's a dog chasing he thinks it's a
frisbee<00:04:13.220> time<00:04:13.580> oh<00:04:20.350> he<00:04:21.350> legit<00:04:21.590> control<00:04:22.550> see<00:04:25.420> cuz
