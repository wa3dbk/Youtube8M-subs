00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 this video with beauty by allibert 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.059
 featuring intel core i7 processor 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.960
 start gaming yo people welcome to one 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.610
 new video 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.259
 a while ago I had you mine 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 show a new console 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.800
 well it is half a console half pc 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.850
 see half a steam and what it was called le 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.170
 often 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.539
 or the energy maybe you do n't know 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.980
 exactly but you have it anyway 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 got that new console from which I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.109
 I am very curious how that is exactly 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 because I hadn't turned on here yet 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.110
 he the alienware alpha 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.820
 creatures than I you really look a little 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.620
 box I just want your bit 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 tell what it is and how 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.500
 that works exactly 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 because I am very curious how the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.690
 next generation of consoles goes out 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 Someone there now of course xbox xbox one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.100
 playstation 4 the who you you may use it 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 now and then we naturally like these steamers 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.699
 und because for the people who did not have 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.160
 co- directed the first video 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 it is actually a computer that box 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.930
 you just once saw a computer with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.000
 software the on so you steam games wii 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.640
 games ios 10 got god can play on the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.340
 watching television and behind me you see him 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.549
 so now also reese for that is just 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.000
 shit well that was just windows what 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.729
 on it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.710
 we will show again yes you come 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600
 but 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.009
 oh well that is also the windows blanket 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 but it's pretty interesting 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
 just a computer is just 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 which acts as a console for you 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.650
 very often you have games at the best 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.689
 want to play graphic and fashion and then 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.840
 they actually play on the pc so this would 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.189
 a very nice intervention in this 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.600
 I do not know if they enter into the crown 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.920
 I show you how that works have 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.720
 by the way not seen it by the way 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 so I am also very curious how it looks 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.360
 looks out 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.979
 of course they also have this console 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.229
 Names sent in can look 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 yeah what the really new one 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.770
 hype it is really just windows what 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.290
 insists 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.380
 loading your about you why ok now is coming 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.939
 so really the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.729
 the console is the first phase of 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.229
 start up see who would it right away 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.000
 and then i will see to us i have 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.340
 studio to finally be able to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.580
 ok this is the main menu I know 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.630
 not whether this will change but you 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.269
 is therefore possible for this 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.010
 turn on steam settings help and power 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.120
 ok so then we go to doing things 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.200
 to mention 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.910
 steam along and then he goes 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.090
 mane look there he comes what the pot since 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.130
 10 years ok so now you can just steam 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.590
 then on the consoles i am just doing 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.810
 again like that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:46.660
 next ja agi do read completely 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.880
 oh i have to go left on letters a green 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.340
 log in ok I'll just log in and nonsense 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.340
 and then we were logged in jet 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.260
 so basically just exactly how you get to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.900
 that steam big picture is called that according to 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.489
 me that you can play games in consonno 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.530
 only play then you really have it 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.940
 literally on the console and get it 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.590
 play computers 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.230
 library can just be a project here 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.590
 with controllo the title toffer I can 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.870
 just play yes to the television i go 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.209
 and look at library 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.579
 so and and choices just all games 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.280
 play borderlands 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.959
 for up to two bins of maileg and like me 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.200
 who would like to play watch i think 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.639
 I have to install it or if so then 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.230
 you have to just download it and it is very 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.319
 the you press that automatically on your steam 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.639
 console and play small games 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.590
 so that's easy here too 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.590
 where also a brother like a king 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.109
 gary's mot than just on course 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.780
 This is actually so the steam machine 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.650
 got it in a lot of different ones 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.500
 the price ranges I think so 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.870
 cheap as 300 euros to real whole 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.280
 high end of circle exactly how many follow 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.840
 me something of 1000 euros but that suits me 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.609
 not from the link below 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.069
 with all the information the tub exactly 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.569
 yeah see what takes such a thing and what they 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.340
 all in it and what you can do with it 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.560
 and I am really sincere throughout 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.989
 curious what you think you think 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.989
 that we have to say let's say 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.940
 2 years there are now two times three further 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.160
 do you think we are still on xbox 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.680
 play on the playstation on the wii 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.720
 or do you think that at this steam 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.390
 console I don't know if 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.550
 I will say I'd have it all 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.560
 want to see games I have all games 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.900
 without having bought this console 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.390
 I like this game on my steam 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.680
 so i don't have to buy any money again 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.600
 example because I give it on the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.950
 360 and I had to buy again for the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600
 xbox moderate included 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.130
 so that's very nice that you just 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.500
 You can play existing games on you 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.530
 console and I don't think so 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.540
 cost so I am I know I think I am 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.770
 graphics tons of video will be gone 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.660
 everyone is of course used to it again 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.100
 xbox so I'm really not remain 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.690
 let us know in the comments here 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.340
 forget what you think of it 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.500
 certainly not to give a thumbs up 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.620
 check in the link in the description the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.510

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.350
 so that we can see what is in it and 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.150
 that kind of thing 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.010
 and also thank you for watching 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.930
