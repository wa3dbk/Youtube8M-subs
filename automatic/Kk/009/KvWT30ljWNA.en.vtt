00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.340 
and once it's done refreshing click done
and<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> scroll<00:00:57.660> down<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.930> bit<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and you want to scroll down a bit and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
and you want to scroll down a bit and
then<00:00:58.739> you'll<00:00:58.890> find<00:00:59.190> somebody<00:00:59.399> call<00:00:59.699> Raymond

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
then you'll find somebody call Raymond

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.930 
then you'll find somebody call Raymond
source<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.320> thing<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.710> edit<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.640> got

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
source that's the thing you edit you got

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.670 
source that's the thing you edit you got
for<00:01:03.300> um<00:01:05.119> for<00:01:06.119> sources<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
for um for sources so you want to go to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.399 
for um for sources so you want to go to
install<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.360> scroll<00:01:09.750> down<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
install now and scroll down for I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.510 
install now and scroll down for I
physics<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:12.030> click<00:01:12.420> click<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.680> tap

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
physics and then click click that or tap

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
physics and then click click that or tap
it<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> should<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.740> able<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.070> find<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it and then you should be able to find I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.350 
it and then you should be able to find I
physics<00:01:17.909> again<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.420> install<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
physics again and install that and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.760 
physics again and install that and
that's<00:01:21.360> how<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.810> physics<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> these

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that's how you get I physics and these

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
that's how you get I physics and these
are<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> level<00:01:23.580> pecs<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.360> five

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
are all the level pecs you can get five

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.039 
are all the level pecs you can get five
physics<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.150> once<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.330> done<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.509> bb<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
physics and once it's done you bb a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.020 
physics and once it's done you bb a
circle<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> go<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> hold

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
circle you're going to go back to hold

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.469 
circle you're going to go back to hold
screen<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.280> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> unlock<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.360> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
screen and you want to unlock and then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.560 
screen and you want to unlock and then
you'll<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.900> physics<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.180> once<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you'll have I physics and once you go to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.749 
you'll have I physics and once you go to
it<00:01:36.780> there's<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:38.040> level<00:01:38.549> packs

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
it there's going to be two level packs

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.210 
it there's going to be two level packs
already<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.140> level<00:01:40.680> pecs<00:01:40.920> but

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
already it's not really level pecs but

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
already it's not really level pecs but
it's<00:01:41.579> good<00:01:41.820> enough<00:01:41.850> crayon<00:01:42.689> physics<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.350> like

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it's good enough crayon physics is like

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's good enough crayon physics is like
it's<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> best<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.530> these<00:01:46.860> two

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it's like the best one out of these two

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700 
it's like the best one out of these two
because<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.909> teaches<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.450> how<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.710> play

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
because it teaches you how to play

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.179 
because it teaches you how to play
crayon<00:01:50.520> physics<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.630> physics<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.680> sandbox

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
crayon physics or I physics and sandbox

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.819 
crayon physics or I physics and sandbox
is<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.880> freestyle<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.409> use<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
is like just freestyle you can use to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.270 
is like just freestyle you can use to
anything<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.890> that's<00:01:58.890> how<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> get

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
anything in here and that's how you get

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.960 
anything in here and that's how you get
