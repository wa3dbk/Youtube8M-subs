 cosworth da philippe vayrac overcharged 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.830
 Philippe Bernier is a little bit more 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.659
 far 7th an unusual place for 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.610
 the talented renaud team but a control 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.220

 penalty of 45 seconds at the aero turbo 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.800
 in this end of the first surprise stage 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.690
 the dolphin of jose barbara is not a 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.729
 northerner but a southern sylvain 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.960
 paulo to drivers of the cup his 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.789
 second place is all the more 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.800
 unexpectedly only 5 small 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.800
 seconds separate the porsche from the r5 gt 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.459
 hasbro who in the morning the atmosphere was 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.240
 so to the uncertainty at the start of the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.470
 second step 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.810

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.350
 well not at all jose barbara handed 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.150
 the clocks on time right from the first 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.720
 loop by realizing three new times 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.239
 scratching 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.620
 the gap will widen even more than 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.830
 bad luck will hit successively 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 all his opponents first sylvain 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.890

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.170
 sylvester he goes off the road by wanting 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.270
 avoid a spectator and leave with five 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.160
 50 minutes late his hopes 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.160
 fly off paulo will finish eleventh 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.750
 Road exit also for 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.940
 bordelais henri de pons who was 5th and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.800
 who must give up his dominican brother 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.600
 then becomes the driver of the cup the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.520
 better placed barbara already far ahead 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.050
 for 2nd place that the fight has had 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.490
 place between philippe vergne is well 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.470
 returned after his misadventures of the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.240
 eve and philippe fleury before the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.100
 last loop two seconds separate 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.810
 both pilots and that flipping 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.010
 situation is first philippe 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.410
 Fleury that makes a straight 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.480
 he who has to finish the special stage 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.900
 morbecque slow motion with a reservoir 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.480
 dry 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.830
 he loses a minute then it is the turn of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.810
 philip bernier in the last 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.210

 this is the first good result of the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.640
 season to match it to angres b 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.200
 victory of jean jacques barbara who has 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.020
