 "Pharmacists or health food store workers: who will advise better?" 

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:08.845
 Yes, as we could see, the studies again and again show that average employees 

00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:11.420
 health food stores don't even know what they're talking about. 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 But maybe nobody knows about food supplements. 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.661
 Two recent North American studies - one in Canada - have recently been published 

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.865
 second in the US. They compared advice received in health food stores and pharmacies. 

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:27.433
 Canada researchers went out and asked questions like this: 

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.776
 â€œWill ginseng give me more energy? Will beta-carotene help me beat cancer? 

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:34.409
 Will Shark Cartilage Cure Cancer? " 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.809
 What percentage of visits to a total of 192 different health food stores 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.448
 researchers have received advice that can be considered accurate or at least 

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:46.119
 quite accurate, in line with what science is at the moment? 

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:49.090
 One hundred percent? Fifty? 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.187
 No! Only in seven percent of visits. 

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:59.333
 Pharmacists have done about ten times better. 

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:04.311
 In an American study, they hired actors who went to pharmacies and health food stores 

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:09.781
 and pretending to have typical symptoms of type 1 diabetes: excessive thirst and fatigue, 

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.780
 unexplained weight loss (despite overeating) and excessive urination. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.650
 They asked shopkeepers and pharmacies what they thought was what they were supposed to take 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.956
 and if they think they should see a doctor. 

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:29.497
 Because type 1 diabetes can be fatal without treatment, the answer to this question 

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:32.931
 it sounds yes, they should definitely see a doctor. 

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.269
 At this point, all 8 of the 8 pharmacists have passed. Good for them. 

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:43.210
 However, only 6 out of the 12 health food retailers found it necessary. 

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:47.750
 Two of the six salespeople even explicitly advised the customer not to go to the doctor. 

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:54.020
 They justified the fact that the doctor would "give them Ritalin or a bad diagnosis." 

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:58.030
 They said they had a problem with "mold infestation" or had "depleted adrenal glands." 

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:06.370
 Fortunately, they had the right accessories for them, which would cost them only CZK 4,500 a month.
