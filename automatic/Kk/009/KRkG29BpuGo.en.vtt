00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.550 

Marsh<00:02:40.700> I'm<00:02:40.880> not<00:02:41.000> sure<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.209> had<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.570> look<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.110> see

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
Marsh I'm not sure I had to look and see

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.850 
Marsh I'm not sure I had to look and see
maybe<00:02:42.890> like<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:44.440> not<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.560> look<00:02:45.680> at<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
maybe like that not to look at the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.650 
maybe like that not to look at the
manual<00:02:46.070> we'll<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:46.520> exactly<00:02:46.910> how<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:47.390> fits

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
manual we'll see exactly how this fits

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.090 
manual we'll see exactly how this fits
together<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:50.000> know<00:02:50.620> plastic<00:02:51.620> buckles

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
together but you know plastic buckles

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.260 
together but you know plastic buckles
here<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:54.290> actually<00:02:54.770> seems<00:02:55.010> very<00:02:55.190> metal<00:02:55.670> as

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
here this actually seems very metal as

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.370 
here this actually seems very metal as
well<00:02:56.570> with<00:02:57.440> all<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> other<00:02:58.340> little

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
well with all the other little

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.050 
well with all the other little
connections<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:03.019> MIT<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.459> nylon<00:03:04.910> material

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
connections the MIT the nylon material

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.680 
connections the MIT the nylon material
itself<00:03:06.050> seems<00:03:06.440> pretty<00:03:06.680> strong<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:08.030> know<00:03:08.570> our

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
itself seems pretty strong you know our

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.960 
itself seems pretty strong you know our
core<00:03:09.380> use<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:09.950> bake<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.489> don't<00:03:10.730> think

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
core use and that bake so I don't think

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.710 
core use and that bake so I don't think
she's<00:03:11.450> going<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.600> be<00:03:11.660> breaking<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:13.720> think

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
she's going to be breaking this think

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.820 
she's going to be breaking this think
that's<00:03:14.840> going<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.019> do<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.290> for<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.560> unboxing

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
that's going to do it for this unboxing

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.090 
that's going to do it for this unboxing
