help<00:00:24.679> us<00:00:24.800> with<00:00:24.949> halt<00:00:25.130> Turing<00:00:25.369> bridling<00:00:25.910> and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
help us with halt Turing bridling and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.759 
help us with halt Turing bridling and
also<00:00:26.300> for<00:00:26.449> the<00:00:26.509> horse<00:00:26.689> that's<00:00:26.839> fearful<00:00:27.289> to

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
also for the horse that's fearful to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.130 
also for the horse that's fearful to
help<00:00:27.949> calm<00:00:28.189> them<00:00:28.339> down<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.359> what<00:00:29.929> we're<00:00:30.080> gonna

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
help calm them down so what we're gonna

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.920 
help calm them down so what we're gonna
do<00:00:30.380> is<00:00:30.529> again<00:00:30.679> we're<00:00:30.830> going<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.009> take<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.930> the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
do is again we're going to take that the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.420 
do is again we're going to take that the
rein<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.440> we're<00:00:34.040> just<00:00:34.100> going<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:34.310> apply

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
rein and we're just going to apply

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.430 
rein and we're just going to apply
pressure<00:00:34.990> until<00:00:35.990> the<00:00:36.050> head<00:00:36.230> goes<00:00:36.410> the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
pressure until the head goes the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.840 
pressure until the head goes the
direction<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.070> want<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.430> go<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.790> then

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
direction we want it to go and then

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.910 
direction we want it to go and then
we're<00:00:38.030> going<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.180> release<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.720> pressure<00:00:38.920> and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
we're going to release the pressure and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.800 
we're going to release the pressure and
release<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.430> pressure<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:41.480> release<00:00:41.600> the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
release the pressure and release the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.300 
release the pressure and release the
pressure<00:00:41.990> until<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.470> horse<00:00:42.620> learns<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.130> keep

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
pressure until the horse learns to keep

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.600 
pressure until the horse learns to keep
his<00:00:43.460> head<00:00:43.610> down<00:00:43.880> there<00:00:45.130> when<00:00:46.130> you're<00:00:46.280> teaching

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
all the way down now for bridling this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.140 
all the way down now for bridling this
is<00:01:11.600> obviously<00:01:12.380> very<00:01:12.680> helpful<00:01:13.130> what<00:01:14.000> we're

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
is obviously very helpful what we're

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.910 
is obviously very helpful what we're
also<00:01:14.300> going<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.630> do<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.290> we're<00:01:15.620> going<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.800> teach

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
also going to do is we're going to teach

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.270

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
the horse to lower his head to our hand

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.140 
the horse to lower his head to our hand
pressure<00:01:19.580> here<00:01:20.200> yes<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.350> are<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.370> what<00:01:22.880> we<00:01:23.000> do

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
pressure here yes we are so what we do

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.300 
pressure here yes we are so what we do
is<00:01:23.360> we<00:01:23.540> put<00:01:23.770> our<00:01:24.770> hand<00:01:25.100> up<00:01:25.250> here<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:27.250> apply<00:01:28.250> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
is we put our hand up here and apply the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.070 
is we put our hand up here and apply the
pressure<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.790> same<00:01:28.970> way<00:01:29.150> just<00:01:29.570> push<00:01:29.780> just

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
pressure the same way just push just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.130 
pressure the same way just push just
just<00:01:30.800> don't<00:01:31.729> push<00:01:31.940> down<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.210> him<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:33.020> a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
just don't push down on him just a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.260 
just don't push down on him just a
little<00:01:33.290> slight<00:01:33.470> bit<00:01:33.620> of<00:01:33.710> pressure<00:01:34.180> until<00:01:35.180> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
little slight bit of pressure until the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.790 
little slight bit of pressure until the
horse's<00:01:35.630> head<00:01:35.750> goes<00:01:35.990> down<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:36.620> we're<00:01:36.710> gonna

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
horse's head goes down then we're gonna

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.830 
horse's head goes down then we're gonna
release<00:01:37.510> down<00:01:38.510> release<00:01:39.700> down<00:01:40.700> release<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
release down release down release and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.440 
release down release down release and
release<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.890> release<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.550> that<00:01:44.210> way<00:01:44.330> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
release and release and that way the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.170 
release and release and that way the
horse<00:01:44.630> learns<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.979> move<00:01:46.400> his<00:01:46.490> head<00:01:46.700> down<00:01:46.850> to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
horse learns to move his head down to

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.520 
horse learns to move his head down to
the<00:01:47.270> pressure<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.750> crossed<00:01:47.990> his<00:01:48.110> Pole<00:01:48.409> this

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
the pressure that crossed his Pole this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.460 
the pressure that crossed his Pole this
also<00:01:48.770> helped<00:01:49.130> with<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> horse<00:01:49.580> that<00:01:49.760> pulls<00:01:49.970> back

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
also helped with a horse that pulls back
