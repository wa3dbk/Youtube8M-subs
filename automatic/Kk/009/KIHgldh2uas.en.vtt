00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
automatically again but it has typically

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
automatically again but it has typically
if<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> had<00:01:38.040> something<00:01:38.220> else<00:01:38.369> open<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.210> would

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
if I had something else open it would

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
added some apps down here and yeah it's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
added some apps down here and yeah it's
pretty<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.470> an<00:01:46.740> alternative<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
pretty much just an alternative to the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
can see these ones up here we're open

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280 
can see these ones up here we're open
and<00:03:35.639> i<00:03:35.729> can<00:03:35.879> close<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.479> i<00:03:36.599> can<00:03:36.750> snap<00:03:37.109> them

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and i can close it and i can snap them

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.429 
and i can close it and i can snap them
to<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.500> docks<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.949> this<00:03:38.099> they<00:03:38.370> lock<00:03:38.909> their<00:03:39.439> etc

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
to the docks of this they lock their etc

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.800 
to the docks of this they lock their etc
this<00:03:41.189> is<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> very<00:03:41.819> nice<00:03:41.939> tweak<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.540> pretty

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
this is a very nice tweak it's pretty

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.069 
this is a very nice tweak it's pretty
cheap<00:03:42.989> for<00:03:43.049> two<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.859> four<00:03:44.400> dollars<00:03:44.639> 99<00:03:44.939> and<00:03:45.329> if

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
cheap for two to four dollars 99 and if

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.479 
cheap for two to four dollars 99 and if
you're<00:03:46.229> in<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.379> UK<00:03:46.590> i<00:03:46.799> think<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.159> adds<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.459> to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
you're in the UK i think the adds up to

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.309 
you're in the UK i think the adds up to
about<00:03:47.609> two<00:03:47.970> pounds<00:03:48.150> fifty<00:03:48.629> so<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.870> mean<00:03:49.109> that's

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
about two pounds fifty so I mean that's

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.259 
about two pounds fifty so I mean that's
like<00:03:49.439> the<00:03:49.680> price<00:03:49.859> of<00:03:50.009> your<00:03:50.099> sandwiches<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.909> mean

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
like the price of your sandwiches I mean

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.599 
like the price of your sandwiches I mean
and<00:03:51.449> you're<00:03:51.989> getting<00:03:52.349> pretty<00:03:53.009> nice<00:03:53.250> dock

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
and you're getting pretty nice dock

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.030 
and you're getting pretty nice dock
which<00:03:53.909> is<00:03:54.359> it's<00:03:55.139> quite<00:03:55.319> lightweight<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:55.889> well

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
which is it's quite lightweight as well

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.759 
which is it's quite lightweight as well
as<00:03:56.099> surprisingly<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.639> mean<00:03:56.879> it's<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:58.049> maybe

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
as surprisingly I mean it's a maybe

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.920 
as surprisingly I mean it's a maybe
maybe<00:03:58.859> takes<00:03:59.370> up<00:03:59.579> probably<00:04:00.030> not<00:04:00.120> even<00:04:00.359> 10<00:04:00.689> meg

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
maybe takes up probably not even 10 meg

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.110 
maybe takes up probably not even 10 meg
less<00:04:01.409> than<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.919> it's<00:04:02.159> complete<00:04:02.819> like

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
less than that and it's complete like

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.360 
less than that and it's complete like
it's<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.840> lot<00:04:04.019> faster<00:04:04.290> than<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> multitasking

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
it's a lot faster than the multitasking

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.280 
it's a lot faster than the multitasking
that<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.150> get<00:04:06.299> default<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.900> mean<00:04:07.049> look<00:04:07.079> how

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
that you get default I mean look how

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.879 
that you get default I mean look how
long<00:04:07.409> this<00:04:07.470> takes<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.889> load<00:04:09.530> yeah<00:04:10.530> exactly

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
long this takes the load yeah exactly

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.800 
long this takes the load yeah exactly
that's<00:04:11.310> that's<00:04:11.909> how<00:04:12.060> long<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.389> takes<00:04:12.419> for<00:04:12.750> that

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
that's that's how long it takes for that

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.509 
that's that's how long it takes for that
Molly<00:04:13.079> talking<00:04:13.439> to<00:04:13.530> load<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.949> this<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.250> haven't

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
Molly talking to load and this I haven't

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.789 
Molly talking to load and this I haven't
actually<00:04:14.579> opened<00:04:14.759> out<00:04:15.060> before<00:04:15.419> today<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.380> it's

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
actually opened out before today so it's

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.080 
actually opened out before today so it's
not<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.220> actually<00:04:17.459> had<00:04:17.609> time<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:17.820> load

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
not like it's actually had time to load

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.849 
not like it's actually had time to load
before<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.659> that's<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.440> open<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
before and that's it and is open and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.649 
before and that's it and is open and
this<00:04:20.310> yeah<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:20.849> one<00:04:20.970> now<00:04:21.150> loads<00:04:21.389> quicker

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
this yeah that one now loads quicker

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.500 
this yeah that one now loads quicker
plus<00:04:21.959> if<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.139> open<00:04:22.440> before<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:23.120> yeah<00:04:24.120> as<00:04:24.389> you

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
plus if I open before but yeah as you

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.290 
plus if I open before but yeah as you
can<00:04:24.599> see<00:04:24.779> it's<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.200> lot<00:04:25.349> faster

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
can see it's a lot faster

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.550 
can see it's a lot faster
see<00:04:26.509> that<00:04:26.659> has<00:04:26.750> been<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.930> doc<00:04:27.110> tweak<00:04:27.379> from
