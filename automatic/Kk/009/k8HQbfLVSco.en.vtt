00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
there because they define a pine forest

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.340 
there because they define a pine forest

beyond this regular oak forest that did

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.020 
beyond this regular oak forest that did
a<00:04:57.380> lot<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.740> farming<00:04:58.220> as<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:58.520> can<00:04:58.640> see<00:04:58.820> my

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
a lot of farming as you can see my

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.030 
a lot of farming as you can see my
efficiency<00:04:59.780> for<00:05:00.680> unbreaking<00:05:01.400> 3<00:05:01.430> acts<00:05:02.090> is

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
efficiency for unbreaking 3 acts is

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.930 
efficiency for unbreaking 3 acts is
greatly<00:05:04.040> damaged<00:05:04.910> all<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.220> farming<00:05:07.220> Way<00:05:07.400> and
