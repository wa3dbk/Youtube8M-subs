fine-tuning on that but I'm in the car I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.200 
fine-tuning on that but I'm in the car I
keep<00:01:48.980> saying<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.340> over<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.550> over<00:01:49.670> it's<00:01:49.910> really

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
keep saying it over and over it's really

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.670 
keep saying it over and over it's really
fun<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.540> drive<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:50.780> mean<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:51.260> why<00:01:51.380> they<00:01:51.500> call

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
fun to drive I mean that's why they call

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.130 
fun to drive I mean that's why they call
me<00:01:51.710> ultimate<00:01:52.160> driving<00:01:52.310> machines<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.180> sound

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
me ultimate driving machines and sound

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.690 
me ultimate driving machines and sound
m3<00:01:54.650> this<00:01:54.830> year<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.040> think<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.370> looks<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.610> lot

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
m3 this year I think it looks a lot

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.340 
m3 this year I think it looks a lot
better<00:01:55.880> than<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.240> m6<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:56.840> my<00:01:56.990> personal

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
better than the m6 just my personal

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.830 
better than the m6 just my personal
opinion<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.850> new<00:01:58.970> track<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.270> mean<00:01:59.630> for

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
opinion so the new track I mean for

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.150 
opinion so the new track I mean for
these<00:01:59.960> cars<00:02:00.170> doesn't<00:02:00.620> really<00:02:00.860> make<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.070> big

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
these cars doesn't really make a big

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.469 
these cars doesn't really make a big
difference<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.910> know<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.270> drive

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
difference you know you can drive

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.480 
difference you know you can drive
anywhere<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.050> bank<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.500> won<00:02:03.650> I<00:02:03.950> think

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
anywhere on the bank and you won I think

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.890 
anywhere on the bank and you won I think
it<00:02:04.580> looks<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.820> lot<00:02:04.940> better<00:02:05.180> being<00:02:05.450> all<00:02:05.600> black

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
it looks a lot better being all black

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.930 
it looks a lot better being all black
and<00:02:06.200> brand<00:02:06.410> new<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.580> know<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.820> pretty

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
and brand new but you know it's pretty

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.639 
and brand new but you know it's pretty
much<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.179> same<00:02:08.420> old<00:02:08.690> tracks<00:02:09.050> last<00:02:09.350> year

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
much the same old tracks last year

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.620 
much the same old tracks last year

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
except smoother me now we have a new

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.360 
except smoother me now we have a new
engineer<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.200> board<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.830> alternator<00:02:13.310> has

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
engineer on board and the alternator has

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.280 
engineer on board and the alternator has
always<00:02:13.670> had<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.820> really<00:02:14.030> strong<00:02:14.360> team<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.720> he's
