there<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.470> throwing<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> bit<00:02:49.740> off<00:02:49.860> six

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
there and throwing it a bit off six

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
there and throwing it a bit off six
organs<00:02:50.490> are<00:02:50.640> moving<00:02:50.910> out<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.150> field<00:02:51.330> just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
organs are moving out in the field just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.390 
organs are moving out in the field just
drawing<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.560> probe<00:02:52.800> away<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.070> looks<00:02:53.250> like

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
drawing that probe away it looks like

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.100 
drawing that probe away it looks like
that<00:02:53.550> drone<00:02:54.390> might<00:02:54.570> end<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.840> getting

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
that drone might end up getting

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.650 
that drone might end up getting
slaughtered<00:02:55.730> let's<00:02:56.730> see<00:02:56.880> Oh<00:02:57.120> does<00:02:57.450> end<00:02:57.630> up

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
slaughtered let's see Oh does end up

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270 
slaughtered let's see Oh does end up
getting<00:02:57.900> slaughtered<00:02:58.170> poof<00:02:58.560> blood<00:02:59.130> all<00:02:59.250> over

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
getting slaughtered poof blood all over

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.760 
getting slaughtered poof blood all over
the<00:02:59.459> ground<00:02:59.670> nice<00:03:00.060> nice<00:03:00.660> job<00:03:00.990> quick<00:03:01.500> like

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
the ground nice nice job quick like

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.100 
the ground nice nice job quick like
reach<00:03:02.010> /<00:03:02.370> by<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.880> by<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.690> probe<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.050> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
reach / by that by that probe and it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.390 
reach / by that by that probe and it
looks<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.410> we're<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.740> see<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> third

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
looks like we're going to see a third

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.250 
looks like we're going to see a third
hatch<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.880> follow<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.420> probe<00:03:06.780> also<00:03:07.110> going

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
hatch to follow that probe also going

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.560 
hatch to follow that probe also going
that's<00:03:08.070> actually<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.610> be<00:03:08.670> close<00:03:08.880> drone

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
that's actually going to be close drone

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.880 
that's actually going to be close drone
going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.810> twelve<00:03:10.080> o'clock<00:03:10.260> location<00:03:10.709> but

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
going to twelve o'clock location but

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.590 
going to twelve o'clock location but
probe<00:03:11.130> almost<00:03:11.550> going<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.820> there<00:03:12.060> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
probe almost going to be there that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.000 
probe almost going to be there that
looks<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.900> shuttles<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.440> get<00:03:13.560> really

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
looks like shuttles going to get really

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.410 
looks like shuttles going to get really
good<00:03:14.250> use<00:03:14.459> out<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.850> probe<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.240> probe

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
good use out of this probe this probe

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.790 
good use out of this probe this probe
has<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> little<00:03:16.110> bit<00:03:16.230> more<00:03:16.380> careful<00:03:16.680> now

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
has to be a little bit more careful now

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.840 
has to be a little bit more careful now
though<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.400> little<00:03:17.610> bit<00:03:17.700> low<00:03:17.820> on

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
though because it's a little bit low on

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.120 
though because it's a little bit low on
health<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:19.050> it's<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.350> absolutely

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
health you can see it's just absolutely

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.610 
health you can see it's just absolutely
doing<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.820> beautiful<00:03:21.120> job<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.900> harassing

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
doing a beautiful job of harassing

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.140 
doing a beautiful job of harassing
shines<00:03:22.860> economy<00:03:23.280> making<00:03:23.459> sure<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.970> shine

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
shines economy making sure that shine

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
shines economy making sure that shine
this<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.450> what<00:03:24.570> I'm<00:03:24.660> talking<00:03:24.690> about<00:03:25.019> there's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
this is what I'm talking about there's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.080 
this is what I'm talking about there's
the<00:03:25.290> pylon<00:03:25.620> block<00:03:25.830> which<00:03:26.280> candle<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.850> that

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the pylon block which candle I that

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.750 
the pylon block which candle I that
third<00:03:27.300> hatchery<00:03:27.660> even<00:03:28.019> longer<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:29.580> things

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
third hatchery even longer so things

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.130 
third hatchery even longer so things
really<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.239> well<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.570> shuttle<00:03:30.810> thus<00:03:30.930> far

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
really going well for shuttle thus far

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.259 
really going well for shuttle thus far
he<00:03:32.040> hasn't<00:03:32.250> he<00:03:32.610> had<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.820> place<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> two

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
he hasn't he had to place the two

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.550 
he hasn't he had to place the two
cannons<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.780> looks<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.110> little<00:03:34.320> bit<00:03:34.410> later

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
cannons it looks like a little bit later

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.380 
cannons it looks like a little bit later
but<00:03:34.709> knows<00:03:34.920> our<00:03:35.040> glee<00:03:35.190> pressured<00:03:35.550> thus<00:03:35.670> far<00:03:35.850> so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
but knows our glee pressured thus far so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.910 
but knows our glee pressured thus far so
six<00:03:36.660> servings<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.200> delayed<00:03:37.470> hatcheries<00:03:37.920> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
six servings to delayed hatcheries and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920 
six servings to delayed hatcheries and
he's<00:03:38.730> really<00:03:38.880> rolling<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.510> looks<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:39.780> he

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
he's really rolling that looks like he

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
he's really rolling that looks like he
also<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.680> now<00:03:40.800> placed<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.220> gateway<00:03:41.430> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
also just now placed that gateway and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.370 
also just now placed that gateway and
yeah<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.360> looks<00:03:42.540> like<00:03:42.660> he<00:03:42.750> managed<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.110> keep<00:03:43.230> up

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
yeah it looks like he managed to keep up

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.500 
yeah it looks like he managed to keep up
with<00:03:43.410> his<00:03:43.620> economy<00:03:43.800> as<00:03:44.040> well<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:45.150> little<00:03:45.330> bit

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
with his economy as well so a little bit

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.390 
with his economy as well so a little bit
of<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.630> rocky<00:03:45.780> start<00:03:45.989> there<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:46.500> Chinese<00:03:46.830> no<00:03:46.980> by

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
of a rocky start there for Chinese no by

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.470 
of a rocky start there for Chinese no by
no<00:03:47.430> means<00:03:47.760> out<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.239> match<00:03:48.450> but

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
no means out of this match but

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.759 
no means out of this match but
definitely<00:03:49.140> has<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.440> be<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> little<00:03:49.680> bit

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
definitely has to be a little bit

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.650 
definitely has to be a little bit
flustered<00:03:50.040> now<00:03:50.280> walking<00:03:50.730> into<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.970> let's<00:03:51.540> see

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
flustered now walking into it let's see

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.210 
flustered now walking into it let's see
if<00:03:51.720> he<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:51.870> at<00:03:52.050> least<00:03:52.260> stop<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.709> second<00:03:53.010> probe

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
if he can at least stop the second probe

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.770 
if he can at least stop the second probe
scout<00:03:53.489> he's<00:03:53.640> got<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.850> lot<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.120> zerglings<00:03:54.450> out

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
scout he's got a lot of zerglings out

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.820 
scout he's got a lot of zerglings out
there<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.140> almost<00:03:55.230> feel<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:55.680> you're

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
there and almost feel like if you're

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.080 
there and almost feel like if you're
going<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.010> invest<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.430> six<00:03:56.640> Earthlings<00:03:56.940> you

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
going to invest the six Earthlings you

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.759 
going to invest the six Earthlings you
need<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.570> managed<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.170> kill<00:03:58.320> one<00:03:58.350> probe

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
need that we managed to kill one probe

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.190 
need that we managed to kill one probe
but<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> might<00:03:59.459> as<00:03:59.580> well<00:03:59.700> go<00:03:59.880> second<00:04:00.660> one<00:04:00.780> then

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
but you might as well go second one then

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.660 
but you might as well go second one then
we're<00:04:01.380> already<00:04:01.590> seeing<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.980> tech<00:04:02.250> d'Oleron

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
we're already seeing a tech d'Oleron

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.580 
we're already seeing a tech d'Oleron
again<00:04:03.330> what<00:04:03.510> we've<00:04:03.660> seen<00:04:03.900> well<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:04.500> I've

a and a good position to kind of throw
that<00:04:41.540> around<00:04:41.690> let's<00:04:42.020> see<00:04:42.140> if<00:04:42.200> he<00:04:42.260> places<00:04:42.500> down

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
that around let's see if he places down

that around let's see if he places down
a<00:04:42.800> fourth<00:04:43.070> hatchery<00:04:43.310> momentarily<00:04:43.730> or<00:04:44.270> if<00:04:44.510> he

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
a fourth hatchery momentarily or if he

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.600 
a fourth hatchery momentarily or if he
if<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.020> start<00:04:45.350> saving<00:04:45.710> larva<00:04:46.040> after<00:04:46.340> he<00:04:46.400> puts

this<00:05:35.600> oftentimes<00:05:36.320> what<00:05:36.620> you'll<00:05:36.770> see<00:05:36.980> is<00:05:37.040> he

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
this oftentimes what you'll see is he

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.160 
this oftentimes what you'll see is he
just<00:05:38.150> kind<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.330> a<00:05:38.420> hidden<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.050> is

just kind of a hidden and this is

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.630 
just kind of a hidden and this is
usually<00:05:39.380> where<00:05:39.680> you'll<00:05:39.800> see<00:05:39.980> it<00:05:40.070> as<00:05:40.190> it'll<00:05:40.550> be

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
usually where you'll see it as it'll be

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.910 
usually where you'll see it as it'll be
hidden<00:05:40.760> at<00:05:40.970> that<00:05:41.090> natural<00:05:41.480> expansion<00:05:41.920> away

these<00:06:43.910> scourge<00:06:44.180> let's<00:06:44.510> see<00:06:44.630> if<00:06:44.690> he's<00:06:44.810> going<00:06:44.900> to

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
these scourge let's see if he's going to

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
corsair back there actually I could see

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.060 
corsair back there actually I could see
scourge<00:07:08.080> cannon<00:07:09.080> not<00:07:09.260> warped<00:07:09.590> in<00:07:09.740> looks<00:07:09.920> like

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
scourge cannon not warped in looks like

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.830 
scourge cannon not warped in looks like
the<00:07:10.160> scourge<00:07:10.400> didn't<00:07:10.760> saw<00:07:11.030> the<00:07:11.090> can<00:07:11.420> warping

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
the scourge didn't saw the can warping

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.600 
the scourge didn't saw the can warping
in<00:07:11.930> but<00:07:12.110> didn't<00:07:12.350> see<00:07:12.380> that<00:07:12.470> corsair<00:07:12.950> I<00:07:13.190> think

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
in but didn't see that corsair I think

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.800 
in but didn't see that corsair I think
they<00:07:13.670> could<00:07:13.820> have<00:07:13.910> actually<00:07:14.030> suicide<00:07:14.600> dived

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
they could have actually suicide dived

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.360 
they could have actually suicide dived
there<00:07:15.080> but<00:07:15.320> really<00:07:15.770> seeing<00:07:15.950> what<00:07:16.070> they<00:07:16.160> wanted

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
there but really seeing what they wanted

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.640 
there but really seeing what they wanted
to<00:07:16.490> see<00:07:16.640> seen<00:07:16.940> the<00:07:17.060> three<00:07:17.240> gateways<00:07:17.600> I<00:07:17.870> think

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
to see seen the three gateways I think

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.410 
to see seen the three gateways I think
they<00:07:18.770> saw<00:07:18.920> that<00:07:18.950> temple<00:07:19.370> archives<00:07:19.700> and<00:07:20.090> the

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.420 
they saw that temple archives and the

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.120 
they saw that temple archives and the
weapons<00:07:20.720> one<00:07:20.900> spinning<00:07:21.200> so<00:07:21.500> looks<00:07:22.070> like

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
weapons one spinning so looks like

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.710 
weapons one spinning so looks like
shuttles<00:07:22.520> actually<00:07:22.850> playing<00:07:23.090> this<00:07:23.210> a<00:07:23.270> lot

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720

like<00:07:24.530> the<00:07:24.830> last<00:07:25.220> era<00:07:25.550> and<00:07:25.730> we'll<00:07:25.880> see<00:07:26.060> if<00:07:26.090> this

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
like the last era and we'll see if this

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.300 
like the last era and we'll see if this
works<00:07:26.480> out<00:07:26.690> for<00:07:26.960> them<00:07:27.050> really<00:07:27.920> in<00:07:28.040> there<00:07:28.130> sigh

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
works out for them really in there sigh

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.500 
works out for them really in there sigh
first<00:07:28.550> our<00:07:28.670> temple<00:07:28.940> that<00:07:29.030> will<00:07:29.150> protect<00:07:29.300> him

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
against again some of these short-term

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.390 
against again some of these short-term
interim<00:07:32.150> attacks<00:07:32.450> but<00:07:32.720> ultimately<00:07:33.200> it<00:07:34.040> still

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
interim attacks but ultimately it still

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.490 
interim attacks but ultimately it still
it<00:07:35.030> doesn't<00:07:35.330> help<00:07:35.390> his<00:07:35.510> problem<00:07:35.840> which<00:07:35.960> is<00:07:35.990> how

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500 
it doesn't help his problem which is how

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.770 
it doesn't help his problem which is how
do<00:07:36.560> you<00:07:36.680> get<00:07:36.800> a<00:07:36.830> third<00:07:37.100> base<00:07:37.340> and<00:07:38.330> how<00:07:38.570> do<00:07:38.630> you

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:38.780 
do you get a third base and how do you

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.510 
do you get a third base and how do you
stay<00:07:39.290> economically<00:07:39.740> head<00:07:39.950> in<00:07:40.010> a<00:07:40.100> tantrum<00:07:40.430> out

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 
stay economically head in a tantrum out

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.950 
stay economically head in a tantrum out
of<00:07:40.610> those<00:07:40.670> five<00:07:41.030> hatch<00:07:41.330> fees<00:07:41.600> you<00:07:41.720> can<00:07:41.750> produce

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
of those five hatch fees you can produce

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.570 
of those five hatch fees you can produce
a<00:07:42.170> lot<00:07:42.320> of<00:07:42.350> drones<00:07:42.650> a<00:07:42.800> lot<00:07:42.920> of<00:07:43.040> ground<00:07:43.250> units

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.580 
a lot of drones a lot of ground units

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.430 
a lot of drones a lot of ground units
basically<00:07:44.540> whenever<00:07:44.690> you<00:07:44.900> want<00:07:45.170> and<00:07:45.380> you

and<00:07:47.510> it<00:07:47.570> looks<00:07:47.750> like<00:07:47.960> his<00:07:48.260> answer<00:07:48.620> to<00:07:48.650> this<00:07:48.800> is

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:48.980 
and it looks like his answer to this is

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.120 
and it looks like his answer to this is
to<00:07:49.070> go<00:07:49.430> dark<00:07:50.210> archons<00:07:50.690> so<00:07:51.080> we've<00:07:51.470> definitely
