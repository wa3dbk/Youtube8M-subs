00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
with that and so I'm the strap that came

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.160 
with that and so I'm the strap that came
with<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.970> not<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> best<00:01:27.570> quality

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
with it not really the best quality

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.050 
with it not really the best quality
strap<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.619> mean<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.829> looks<00:01:29.040> good<00:01:29.630> but<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.049> not

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
strap I mean it looks good but it's not

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
strap I mean it looks good but it's not
it<00:01:33.060> feels<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:33.960> break<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.130> metal

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it feels like it might break the metal

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.289 
it feels like it might break the metal
is<00:01:35.520> super<00:01:36.180> super<00:01:36.540> thin<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.299> probably

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
is super super thin as you can probably

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
is super super thin as you can probably
see<00:01:39.650> they're<00:01:40.650> super<00:01:41.280> thin<00:01:41.490> metal<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.649> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
see they're super thin metal so it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
see they're super thin metal so it
doesn't<00:01:44.100> feel<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:45.540> good<00:01:45.780> quality<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
doesn't feel that good quality so I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
doesn't feel that good quality so I
ordered<00:01:46.799> another<00:01:46.920> strap<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.060> actual
