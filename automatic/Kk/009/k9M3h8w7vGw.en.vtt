00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
certain melodies I take that same

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.280 
certain melodies I take that same
concept<00:02:59.370> into<00:02:59.760> dense<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> lot<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.959> times

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
concept into dense so a lot of times

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.039 
concept into dense so a lot of times
when<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:01.620> dancing<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:03.180> only<00:03:03.480> happened

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
when I'm dancing and it's only happened

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.250 
when I'm dancing and it's only happened
about<00:03:04.290> puppy<00:03:04.850> two<00:03:05.850> years<00:03:06.150> where<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> completely

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
about puppy two years where I completely

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.039 
about puppy two years where I completely
completely<00:03:08.040> feel<00:03:08.370> comfortable<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.940> doing

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
completely feel comfortable in doing

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.750 
completely feel comfortable in doing
doing<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.170> where<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:11.760> see<00:03:12.450> myself<00:03:12.480> as

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
doing this where I see myself as

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.370 
doing this where I see myself as
basically<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.850> percussionist<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:15.930> dancing

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
basically a percussionist as I'm dancing

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.140 
basically a percussionist as I'm dancing
so<00:03:16.680> everything<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.670> more<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.970> just

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so everything is more of just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.910 
so everything is more of just
improvising<00:03:19.280> with<00:03:21.019> being<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.200> sync<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.739> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
improvising with being in sync with the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.360 
improvising with being in sync with the
music<00:03:23.269> overall<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.450> mean<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.810> had<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> long<00:03:25.370> long
