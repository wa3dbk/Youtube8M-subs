00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
short stories by nathan englander the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.840 
short stories by nathan englander the
globe<00:03:20.769> at<00:03:20.950> least<00:03:21.100> stories<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.430> pretty<00:03:21.640> vague

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
globe at least stories is pretty vague

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.850 
globe at least stories is pretty vague
but<00:03:22.120> from<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.660> title<00:03:22.840> i'm<00:03:23.019> assuming<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.590> has

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
but from the title i'm assuming that has

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.280 
but from the title i'm assuming that has
Jewish<00:03:24.489> undertones<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.870> says<00:03:26.019> that<00:03:26.049> it's

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
Jewish undertones and it says that it's

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.949 
Jewish undertones and it says that it's
deep<00:03:26.410> tragedy<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.100> comedy<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.570> think<00:03:28.720> it's

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
deep tragedy and comedy so I think it's

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.479 
deep tragedy and comedy so I think it's
going<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.110> be<00:03:29.230> really<00:03:29.380> interesting<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.160> so

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
going to be really interesting and so

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.250 
going to be really interesting and so
