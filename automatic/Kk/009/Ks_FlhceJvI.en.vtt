00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:32.329
 It's the mistress we posted here more 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:36.340
 once in the devotional channel the week we 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.840
 we now know the three doors 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.579
 related in apocalypse 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.260
 Can you keep up with this reading? 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.800
 with me and apocalypse 3 in verse 8 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.649
 I know his works and put 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.360
 before you an open door that 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.809
 no one can close 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.480
 Behold, I stand at the door and knock if anyone 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.430
 listen to my voice and open the door 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.829
 I will enter this one with him and he with me 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.350
 after these things I looked and before 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:13.040
 I was an open door in the sky 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.639
 this first port that is reported 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.619
 here apocalypse is jesus is a door that 

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.179
 people usually say that it is 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.799
 easy to find 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.579
 I'll tell you it's the other way around. 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.420
 it is very difficult to find and imagine 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.789
 that you were in the dark place 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.810
 people to say so against the bustle 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.319
 the end of the tunnel but actually who is 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.529
 In the dark she thinks nothing until she 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:46.759
 will be fumbling and found the 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:47.719
 door and that door exploring tenth 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.540
 year inside 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.490
 This door is Jesus. 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.220
 who is in the dark does not really 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.010
 Can you find this door? 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.310
 I'll tell you the door in the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.200
 exact sequence you can not 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.870
 jump a door you have to shape 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.810
 Exactly the first door goes through the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.090
 second door and then it will be now 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.370
 that's when we found this first 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.160
 door 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.520
 We stood under the door and stood 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.150
 I do not go in here or I stay here on the side of 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.440
 out 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.660
 I stay here under the spider 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.630
 usually when people found 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.270
 the track but do not know the house of God 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.520
 she knows the house of God completely 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 rate from below the stop 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.360
 if I come to your house to be under 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.000
 door stop 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.090
 I'll get to know I delayed 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.970
 I can not even see but I will not go into the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.910
 forced and the room of the house of God 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.190
 means that it symbolizes the refreshment that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.250
 we need it in our everyday lives 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 if we stand under the stop we 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.959
 we do not have God's refreshment 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.060
 maybe in your house you can not 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.170
 to see what your kitchen is like 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.100
 door and if I stay under the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.250
 stop 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.690
 I will not arrive until I know your 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.700
 house and what next symbolizes the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.610
 symbolizes the place of food in the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.560
 God's house in the father's house 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.569
 we have a place to satiate our 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.379
 hunger and our city 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.689
 and also has the bedroom the room symbolizes 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.810
 the dog of intimacy 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.879
 How many of us find Christ the most? 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.790
 we did not get out of the way 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.450
 others did not even enter the house of 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.750
 God 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:48.120
 there is simply exit and back to the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.129
 darkness to the world of darkness today 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.060
 know more the house of god seth part 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.030
 of the stop 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.219
 participate more in what 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.260
 God has for you and God has gospel 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:03.849
 we want intimacy with cds want 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.500
 sides want to feed as long as you stay 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.189
 under the fence just looking at things 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.419
 happening in the house of God you will not 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.629
 to participate 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:16.100
 what is best in the house of God 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.550
 I just want to talk on the second door. 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.370
 when we meet jesus then we 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.830
 We need to invite Jesus to live in 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.260
 our home 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.940
 this second port is interesting that 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.180
 she has a lock on the side of 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:37.460
 inside because Jesus when he arrives and 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:40.180
 not enough to break into your house he does not 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.730
 he knocks on the door 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.700
 then you open the door does not allow 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.850
 He comes to dwell in your life is 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.440
 You who make the choices are you that 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.430
 accepts 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.610
 He is in your house and make an address. 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.180
 think of it today let Jesus enter 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.640
 Your house is knocking on the door. 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.190
 maybe you know the house of God today 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.690
 you already know but jesus does not have it yet 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:16.700
 made dwelling in his life at his home in 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:20.960
 your daily life that is very important to 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.350
 third door is new jerusalem in the world 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.390
 said in the beginning there is no such thing as you 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.160
 skip one of the doors 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.130
 first you know the crisis you 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.170
 Do you know your father's house? 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.129
 then you open the door of your house and 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.199
 allow him to make an address 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:42.419
 and so you know the new jerusalem 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:45.899
 place where Christ was informed so that 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.300
 this or that adopts the spirit and 

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:49.969
 Truth maybe for so long you're 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.029
 converted 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:57.199
 You've never heard of this. 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:59.719
 the end of the other side you and God are 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.179
 looking at this message the first time 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.069
 I want to say to you, Jesus, and 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.469
 midazolam 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.779
 he wants to change his story and that 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.449
 rewrite your story 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:14.089
 maybe everything is wrong today is 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.939
 complicated you no longer know 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:22.039
 where you have to even think about taking the 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:24.019
 own life do not allow this delivery 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.169
 Your List Life 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:31.479
 It will change your story today. 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:36.289
 found in the door of light units of them 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:39.259
 nor enter the house of God 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:43.189
 know that it allows you to enter your 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:49.239
 life and that from today you can 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:49.239
 live a new life in christ jesus
