00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.780

 raising the mayor link to the group in the description 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.289
 hello everyone with you madder and in this video 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.350
 I want to show you how the beginning of the game 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.779
 very easy to do sebe for puja if 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.599
 you play for rating then go to the bottom 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 rune and log on a certain tree of themes 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.520
 most we create a cage for the enemy 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.800
 further take a position so that we 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.559
 perfectly seen the runes and waiting for the appearance 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.440
 runes when the enemy goes to take the runes 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.170
 but it is very easy to layer it in a cookie 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 the fact that we know the trajectory of motion 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 opponents when he tries to take his hand 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.100
 another plus of this idea is the effect 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.320
 surprises even if the opponent 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.020
 wants to put a standard ward 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.719
 points you simply simply will not be seen 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.750
 because of the trees and when you have his kitchen he 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.670
 not a little can probably get confused yet 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.040
 It is worth considering that you will have two or 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.119
 three even if your opponent tries 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.159
 travel trees 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.680
 trying to escape you can still 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.439
 kill him extremely quickly due to your 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.600
 abilities when playing dyr we create 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.939
 better trap which will 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.100
 impossible to get out with the help of the Tungus 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.320
 only if the opponent has a blink but 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 if you will be next in the allies 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 having a camp or a sleigh then you are hooks 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.500
 opponents they are using their 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.479
 abilities will not allow the enemy to tie 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.790
 blink and you kill him easily 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.070
 This interesting start has become available since 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.880
 a patch in which the puja greatly increased 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.670
 equal to hook 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.409
 also want to note if you are going 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.200
