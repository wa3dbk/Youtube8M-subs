this<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.910> feel<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.420> they'll<00:00:30.570> still<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this I do feel that they'll still be the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
season-long loans and maybe we need to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.370 
season-long loans and maybe we need to
make<00:00:33.120> better<00:00:33.360> use<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.600> those<00:00:33.899> than<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
make better use of those than the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
make better use of those than the
emergency<00:00:35.130> loans<00:00:35.340> which<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.020> which<00:00:37.020> means<00:00:37.260> a
