00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
videos onto that and play them as long

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.500 
videos onto that and play them as long
as<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.739> live<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.910> that's<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.209> really<00:02:15.239> cool

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
as you live so that's a really cool

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.410 
as you live so that's a really cool
feature<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.050> only<00:02:16.200> problem<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.890> i<00:02:17.130> said

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
feature but the only problem like i said

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.600 
feature but the only problem like i said
is<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.750> no<00:02:18.930> games<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.920> don't<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.489> can

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
is that no games I don't think you can

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.580 
is that no games I don't think you can
save<00:02:20.819> games<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.390> them<00:02:21.660> especially<00:02:22.440> since
