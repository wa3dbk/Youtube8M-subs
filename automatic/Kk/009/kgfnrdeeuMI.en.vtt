scripts<00:01:00.199> into<00:01:00.469> a<00:01:00.680> rough<00:01:00.949> storyboard<00:01:01.519> this

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
scripts into a rough storyboard this

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.850 
scripts into a rough storyboard this
becomes<00:01:02.449> sort<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.079> blueprint<00:01:03.620> for<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
becomes sort of the blueprint for the

becomes sort of the blueprint for the
final<00:01:04.129> cinematic<00:01:05.320> then<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:06.740> compose<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
final cinematic then we compose the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.520 
final cinematic then we compose the
boards<00:01:07.490> into<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.789> rough<00:01:08.090> animatic<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.380> will

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
boards into a rough animatic this will

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.749 
boards into a rough animatic this will
help<00:01:09.619> us<00:01:09.770> figure<00:01:09.950> out<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.250> timing<00:01:10.490> beats

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
help us figure out the timing beats

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:18.859 
help us figure out the timing beats
transitions<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.869> voice<00:01:11.990> over<00:01:12.170> stuff

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.420 

once<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.020> storyboard<00:01:20.439> is<00:01:20.530> approved<00:01:20.890> the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
once the storyboard is approved the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.100 
once the storyboard is approved the
illustrator<00:01:21.909> takes<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.330> from<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.570> sketch<00:01:22.780> and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
illustrator takes it from a sketch and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.990 
illustrator takes it from a sketch and
turns<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.650> into<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.920> awesome<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.460> painted

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
turns it into the awesome and painted

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.270 
turns it into the awesome and painted
illustration<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.600> see<00:01:25.750> em<00:01:25.869> game<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:26.860> I<00:01:26.890> take

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
illustration you see em game so I take

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.440 
illustration you see em game so I take
the<00:01:27.630> storyboards<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.200> I've<00:01:30.070> add<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:31.030> certain

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the storyboards and I've add a certain

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.109 
the storyboards and I've add a certain
amount<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.720> mood<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.229> life<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:33.159> them<00:01:33.430> when<00:01:34.090> I

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
amount of mood and life to them when I

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.120 
amount of mood and life to them when I
paint<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.630> keep<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.110> mind<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.560> keep<00:01:35.590> all<00:01:36.009> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
paint I keep in mind to keep all the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.490 
paint I keep in mind to keep all the
elements<00:01:36.399> separate<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.090> layers<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:38.170> it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
elements separate on layers so it's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
elements separate on layers so it's
easier<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:39.009> all<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.310> animators<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.729> animate

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.880 

once<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.509> painting<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.869> finished<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.649> load

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
once the painting is finished we load

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.710 
once the painting is finished we load
the<00:01:45.009> layers<00:01:45.220> into<00:01:45.549> our<00:01:45.759> proprietary<00:01:46.030> editor

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
the layers into our proprietary editor

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.749 
the layers into our proprietary editor
it<00:01:47.259> was<00:01:47.380> custom<00:01:47.710> designed<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:48.100> let<00:01:48.250> us<00:01:48.369> animate

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
it was custom designed to let us animate

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.359 
it was custom designed to let us animate
and<00:01:48.939> edit<00:01:49.360> 2d<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:49.840> 3d<00:01:49.869> assets<00:01:50.369> something

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
and edit 2d and 3d assets something

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.620 
and edit 2d and 3d assets something
that's<00:01:51.490> pretty<00:01:51.580> cool<00:01:51.789> about<00:01:51.970> our<00:01:52.119> cinematics

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
that's pretty cool about our cinematics

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's pretty cool about our cinematics
is<00:01:52.750> none<00:01:53.319> of<00:01:53.470> them<00:01:53.619> are<00:01:53.710> pre-rendered<00:01:54.250> that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
is none of them are pre-rendered that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.090 
is none of them are pre-rendered that
means<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:55.630> have<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> ability<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.470> show<00:01:56.860> your

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
means we have the ability to show your

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800 
means we have the ability to show your
player<00:01:57.369> character<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.179> how<00:01:58.360> are<00:01:58.509> painted
