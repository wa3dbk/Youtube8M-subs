00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
healthy stuff let's go ahead and look at

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.740 
healthy stuff let's go ahead and look at
the<00:00:12.030> back<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:12.349> or<00:00:13.349> both<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.490> our<00:00:14.759> ground

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the back here or both this is our ground

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.750 
the back here or both this is our ground
beef<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.170> our<00:00:16.350> bison<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> can

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
beef this is our bison and as you can

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.140 
beef this is our bison and as you can
see<00:00:17.940> here<00:00:18.119> our<00:00:18.150> bison<00:00:18.630> has<00:00:19.520> 11<00:00:20.520> grams<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.910> fat

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
see here our bison has 11 grams of fat

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.750 
see here our bison has 11 grams of fat
850<00:00:22.140> milligrams<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.769> cholesterol<00:00:22.890> 60

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
850 milligrams of cholesterol 60

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810 
850 milligrams of cholesterol 60
milligrams<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.330> sodium<00:00:25.189> here<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.519> more

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
milligrams of sodium here we have more

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
milligrams of sodium here we have more
17<00:00:27.449> grams<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.779> fat<00:00:27.930> 6<00:00:28.260> grams<00:00:28.500> more<00:00:28.769> 80

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
17 grams of fat 6 grams more 80

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.269 
17 grams of fat 6 grams more 80
milligrams<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.449> cholesterol<00:00:31.140> instead<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> 50

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
milligrams of cholesterol instead of 50

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.799 
milligrams of cholesterol instead of 50
so<00:00:32.460> 30<00:00:32.730> milligrams<00:00:33.149> more<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.890> 75<00:00:34.940> sodium<00:00:35.940> so

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so 30 milligrams more and 75 sodium so

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.069 
so 30 milligrams more and 75 sodium so
15<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.440> only<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.710> 60<00:00:38.129> over<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> it's

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
15 we only at 60 over here so it's

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
15 we only at 60 over here so it's
basically<00:00:40.739> less<00:00:41.070> fat<00:00:41.309> less<00:00:41.430> cholesterol<00:00:41.879> less

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
basically less fat less cholesterol less

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.229 
basically less fat less cholesterol less
sodium<00:00:42.660> than<00:00:43.050> ground<00:00:43.950> beef<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.730> supposed

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
sodium than ground beef so it's supposed

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
sodium than ground beef so it's supposed
to<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.750> healthier<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.800> for

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to be a little healthier and good for

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.240 
to be a little healthier and good for
you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
you
the<00:00:47.640> downside<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> usually<00:00:48.719> does<00:00:48.899> cost<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the downside is it usually does cost a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
the downside is it usually does cost a
little<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:49.920> than<00:00:50.460> ground<00:00:50.700> beef<00:00:50.910> because

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
little bit more than ground beef because

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150 
little bit more than ground beef because
it's<00:00:51.300> less<00:00:51.420> available<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.739> there's<00:00:52.920> another

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it's less available but there's another

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420 
it's less available but there's another
great<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:55.649> actually

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
great thing about it and it actually

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this a little bit it is true federal

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.349 
this a little bit it is true federal

on<00:01:03.600> bison<00:01:04.250> one<00:01:05.250> nice<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.670> bison<00:01:06.180> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
on bison one nice thing about bison is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.770 
on bison one nice thing about bison is
they<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.020> less<00:01:08.180> manufacturer<00:01:09.180> than<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> as

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
they are less manufacturer than that as

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100 
they are less manufacturer than that as
Bulkeley<00:01:10.470> manufactured<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.280> cows<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> there

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
Bulkeley manufactured as cows so there

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
Bulkeley manufactured as cows so there
