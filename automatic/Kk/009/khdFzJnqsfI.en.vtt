00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.719 

okay<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.900> second<00:00:04.290> test<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.740> testing<00:00:05.310> for<00:00:05.340> the

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:05.729 
okay the second test is testing for the

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:07.839 
okay the second test is testing for the
amount<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.359> vinegar<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:07.019> the<00:00:07.109> wine<00:00:07.319> and

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
amount of vinegar and the wine and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.250 
amount of vinegar and the wine and
winemakers<00:00:08.849> don't<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.389> turn<00:00:09.599> vinegar<00:00:10.080> so

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
winemakers don't like to turn vinegar so

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.320 
winemakers don't like to turn vinegar so
we<00:00:10.410> call<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.740> volatile<00:00:11.340> acidity<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.120> this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
we call it volatile acidity and this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.650 
we call it volatile acidity and this
apparatus<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.680> a<00:00:14.040> cash<00:00:14.550> still<00:00:14.970> for<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
apparatus here is a cash still for a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.730 
apparatus here is a cash still for a
volatile<00:00:16.049> acidity<00:00:16.379> or<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:17.250> BA<00:00:17.670> still<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.320> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
volatile acidity or a BA still so it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.089 
volatile acidity or a BA still so it
distills<00:00:20.339> the<00:00:20.699> sample<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:22.259> this<00:00:22.409> beaker<00:00:22.919> and

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
distills the sample into this beaker and

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.669 
distills the sample into this beaker and
again<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.519> try<00:00:23.699> trade<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.329> in<00:00:24.749> order<00:00:25.079> to<00:00:25.409> find

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
again we try trade it in order to find

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.800 
again we try trade it in order to find
out<00:00:25.859> how<00:00:25.890> much<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.909> first<00:00:27.119> thing<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
out how much so the first thing we do is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.009 
out how much so the first thing we do is
we<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.739> this<00:00:29.039> case<00:00:29.310> 10<00:00:29.989> milliliters<00:00:30.989> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
we use in this case 10 milliliters of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.360 
we use in this case 10 milliliters of
the<00:00:31.259> wine<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> pull<00:00:34.949> out<00:00:34.980> 10

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the wine so I'm going to pull out 10

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:46.479 
the wine so I'm going to pull out 10
valves<00:00:35.760> here

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.569 

and<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.670> put<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.970> into<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> stell

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.690 

and<00:00:55.239> then<00:00:55.930> we'll<00:00:56.140> add<00:00:56.320> just<00:00:56.350> a<00:00:56.890> little<00:00:57.309> bit<00:00:57.520> of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
and then we'll add just a little bit of

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.840 
and then we'll add just a little bit of
0.3%<00:01:00.059> hydrogen<00:01:01.059> peroxide<00:01:01.270> just<00:01:01.989> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
0.3% hydrogen peroxide just to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.820 
0.3% hydrogen peroxide just to
counteract<00:01:03.850> any<00:01:04.210> so2<00:01:04.750> that's<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.530> line

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.760 

so<00:01:12.370> by<00:01:13.180> knowing<00:01:13.510> how<00:01:13.780> much<00:01:13.960> wine<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.590> we're

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
so by knowing how much wine that we're

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.200 
so by knowing how much wine that we're
testing<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.580> then<00:01:15.730> what

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
testing and then what

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.430 
testing and then what
how<00:01:16.570> much<00:01:16.840> solvent<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.680> takes<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.400> to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
how much solvent it takes to to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.510 
how much solvent it takes to to
terminate<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.680> wine<00:01:21.300> we<00:01:22.300> end<00:01:22.540> up<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:24.130> then<00:01:24.370> we

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
terminate the wine we end up we then we

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.850 
terminate the wine we end up we then we
can<00:01:24.700> determine<00:01:25.030> how<00:01:25.240> much<00:01:25.540> vinegar<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
can determine how much vinegar is in the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:35.999 
can determine how much vinegar is in the
wine

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.740 

so<00:01:36.549> now<00:01:36.729> we'll<00:01:36.969> turn<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:40.509> will

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
so now we'll turn this on and it will

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.990 
so now we'll turn this on and it will
you<00:01:41.680> don't<00:01:41.860> need<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.159> heat<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.369> this<00:01:42.700> water

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
you don't need to heat up this water

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.550 
you don't need to heat up this water
bath<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.689> it'll<00:01:43.869> take<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.049> little<00:01:44.289> while<00:01:44.530> and

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
bath and it'll take a little while and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.830 
bath and it'll take a little while and
it'll<00:01:45.009> start<00:01:45.340> bubbling<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.030> it'll<00:01:46.270> distill

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it'll start bubbling and it'll distill

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.709 
it'll start bubbling and it'll distill
off<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.500> sample<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.100> will<00:01:48.310> titrate<00:01:48.909> into

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
off the sample that will titrate into

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.639 
off the sample that will titrate into
this<00:01:49.869> Erlenmeyer<00:01:50.409> flask<00:01:55.079> okay<00:01:56.079> now<00:01:56.319> we're

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
this Erlenmeyer flask okay now we're

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.569 
this Erlenmeyer flask okay now we're
ready<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.670> test<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.890> vinegar<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.159> wine<00:02:00.310> or

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
ready to test the vinegar in the wine or

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.819 
ready to test the vinegar in the wine or
the<00:02:00.640> volatile<00:02:01.149> acidity<00:02:01.539> this<00:02:02.319> is<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.619> cash

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
the volatile acidity this is the cash

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.249 
the volatile acidity this is the cash
still<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.670> see<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.030> bubbling<00:02:04.509> away

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
still and you can see it's bubbling away

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.910 
still and you can see it's bubbling away
it's<00:02:05.619> distilling<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.939> sample<00:02:07.530> into<00:02:08.530> this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
it's distilling the sample into this

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.850 
it's distilling the sample into this
condenser<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.239> we're<00:02:11.110> picking<00:02:11.500> up<00:02:11.650> what

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
condenser and we're picking up what

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.120 
condenser and we're picking up what
we're<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:13.390> test<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.709> we'll<00:02:14.890> turn

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
we're going to to test so we'll turn

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.050 
we're going to to test so we'll turn
that<00:02:15.370> off<00:02:16.560> we're<00:02:17.560> done<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.549> then

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
that off we're done with that and then

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.809 
that off we're done with that and then
we'll<00:02:19.209> come<00:02:19.390> over<00:02:19.569> here<00:02:20.370> we'll<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.579> little

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
we'll come over here we'll have a little

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.160 
we'll come over here we'll have a little
phenolphthalein<00:02:24.630> which<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> color

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
phenolphthalein which is a color

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.289 
phenolphthalein which is a color
indicator

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
indicator

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.050 
indicator
we'll<00:02:28.299> make<00:02:28.450> sure<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.810> we're<00:02:29.230> at<00:02:29.410> zero<00:02:30.060> on

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
we'll make sure that we're at zero on

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.039 
we'll make sure that we're at zero on
our<00:02:31.120> pi<00:02:31.630> pad<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:33.640> just<00:02:34.299> went<00:02:34.510> over<00:02:34.660> a

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
our pi pad here we just went over a

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.160 
our pi pad here we just went over a
little<00:02:35.260> bit<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.560> we'll<00:02:36.630> head<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.870> little

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
little bit so we'll head out a little

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.000 
little bit so we'll head out a little
bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.259 

titrate<00:02:42.010> actually<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:46.000> we're

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
titrate actually not like that now we're

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.650 
titrate actually not like that now we're
at<00:02:46.420> zero<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.400> then<00:02:48.609> watch<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.239> we're

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
at zero and then watch this we're

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.050 
at zero and then watch this we're
waiting<00:02:50.049> for<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:50.950> want<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.370> titrate<00:02:51.639> it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
waiting for it we want to titrate it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.349 
waiting for it we want to titrate it
until<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.569> turns<00:02:52.870> pink<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:57.220> we<00:02:57.250> had<00:02:57.579> one<00:02:57.880> drop

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
until it turns pink so we had one drop

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.699 
until it turns pink so we had one drop
at<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.720> time<00:03:00.690> let's<00:03:01.690> see<00:03:01.870> where<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.079> turns<00:03:02.290> pink

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
at a time let's see where it turns pink

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.039 
at a time let's see where it turns pink
and<00:03:03.100> then<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.310> goes<00:03:03.489> away<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.329> it<00:03:04.450> turns<00:03:04.720> pink

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
and then it goes away and it turns pink

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.860 
and then it goes away and it turns pink
then<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.040> goes<00:03:06.250> away<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.079> mixes<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.870> when

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
then it goes away as it mixes so when

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.500 
then it goes away as it mixes so when
it's<00:03:11.049> when<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.680> stays<00:03:12.100> pink<00:03:12.700> for<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> couple<00:03:13.450> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
it's when it stays pink for a couple of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.289 
it's when it stays pink for a couple of
seconds<00:03:14.109> then<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:14.980> know<00:03:15.609> we<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:16.030> what<00:03:16.180> we

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
seconds then we know we have what we

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.479 
seconds then we know we have what we
want<00:03:16.480> which<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.900> right<00:03:17.170> there<00:03:17.200> see<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.280> it's

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
want which is right there see now it's

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.960 
want which is right there see now it's
not<00:03:18.579> going<00:03:18.940> back<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:20.109> clear<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.639> one

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
not going back to clear and this is one

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.920 
not going back to clear and this is one
point<00:03:22.450> zero<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.730> multiply<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.630> point

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
point zero and we multiply one point

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.150 
point zero and we multiply one point
zero<00:03:27.900> by<00:03:28.900> point<00:03:29.560> zero<00:03:30.209> six<00:03:31.680> sorry<00:03:32.739> which<00:03:33.010> is

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
zero by point zero six sorry which is

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.159 
zero by point zero six sorry which is
our<00:03:33.310> constant<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.150> end<00:03:34.359> up<00:03:34.480> with<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.720> VA<00:03:35.019> a

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
our constant and we end up with a VA a

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.089 
our constant and we end up with a VA a
point<00:03:35.620> zero<00:03:36.040> six<00:03:37.109> which<00:03:38.109> is<00:03:38.139> where<00:03:38.560> most<00:03:38.739> red

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
point zero six which is where most red

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.970 
point zero six which is where most red
wines<00:03:39.430> are<00:03:39.700> bottled<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.750> at<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> point<00:03:41.290> zero

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
wines are bottled it's at a point zero

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.819 
wines are bottled it's at a point zero
