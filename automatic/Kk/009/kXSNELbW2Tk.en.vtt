00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.620
 I'm going to make you an owner today . 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.299
 Congratulations, you're the sweetest owner. 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.860
 I've done in my life a candy of 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.860
 milk on top will look perfect 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.270
 to make the pasta of my owner that I 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.280
 I'll start mixing in the mixer 20 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.060
 ml whole milk with a spoonful of 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:33.050
 honey soup and half a yeast tablet 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.970
 biological flash on if you 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.580
 You want to double that recipe, it's just you. 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.540
 use an entire tablet and 15 grams of 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.540
 arrow yeast 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.660
 Now I'm going to leave this little 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.699
 rest for 5 minutes for our pasta 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.699
 It gets much cuter, hottie. 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.820
 in the sequence I'll add an egg two 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.699
 egg yolks a teaspoon of salt or five 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.900
 grams of salt 25 grams of sugar 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.240
 200 ml of coconut milk and 55 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.920
 grams of melted butter but it does not 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.200
 It can be hot, she has to be more or 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.299
 less in the temperature to see more liquid is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.060
 when all liquids are 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.369
 mixed you add 400 grams of 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.200
 flour for bread if you use bogeyman is 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.390
 much better because she has more blue has 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.039
 Your donation will be more cuddly. 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.840
 but if you dont have no problem 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.909
 can use plain cake flour 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.829
 then just hit this dough for 10 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.829
 minutes with a mixer hook 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.970
 you let them wando enough to it 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.950
 look very cute and turn a ball 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.720
 completely homogeneous if you do not 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.850
 can do with the hook you can 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.560
 do this in hand following covers a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.060
 bowl with a little oil place 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.760
 cover inside with plastic 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.910
 film and take to the refrigerator for six 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.910
 hours

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.170
 now just open the dough with 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.209
 about half a centimeter up 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.189
 of a completely floured table 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.689
 with the eight-centimeter cutter you 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.689
 cut the balls of its owner 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.170
 then you can use a cap one 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.060
 piping nozzle to make a small hole 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.100
 In the middle I used a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 16mm to make this ball 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.630
 then you put the brand of its owner 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.030
 on top of a floured copper shape 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.370
 with a loaf of bread and let it 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.060
 time with the very chubby and grown pasta 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.600
 you warm up the oil of a cruel and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.630
 when it's hot 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.420
 approximately 180 degrees you put the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.080
 its owner and fried zones of the two 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.690
 sides 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.640
 He has to turn golden afterwards. 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.280
 place on absorbent paper to 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.680
 excess oil now happier in life 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.200
 You will pass on your sugar owner. 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.880
 of delicious pastries and then 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.600
 serve with a little milk candy for 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.410
 The top is so tasty. 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.410
