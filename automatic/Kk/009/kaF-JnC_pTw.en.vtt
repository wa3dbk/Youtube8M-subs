 and today I'll be studying for you how you can do to stop 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.739
 the sin of a kubica who's game 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.119
 and when you do it on the internet it came by weed 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.960
 point one gcm better saying in extension point gcm 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.259
 it's very simple 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.390
 emphasis too 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 What are you going to do? You're going to rename it right. 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.569
 I'm back gcm 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.300
 With all that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.570
 this will not change in anything will make us abate you will simply 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.880
 rename it the version for all this 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.070
 better pointing pointed out that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.520
 and these two is that only here that is here on earth what I do with them 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 usually these two listeners 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.430
 I have been together with you with what you have marked 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.410
 so these two is what I will have are files with information from the person who 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.320
 not only the club on the internet, it's ok 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.400
 are files s sds 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 what are the information 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.530
 the more important you are to rename 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.980
 the gcm file for that point 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.370
 and re-record 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.470
 your backup and your doctor 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.740
 in my case I had version 2 0 6 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.020
 because the version I consider faster 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 It's the best for me too. 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.310
