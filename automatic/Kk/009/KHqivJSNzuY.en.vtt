00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.170
 I slept 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:28.539
 with pillows of dreams in which 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:33.480
 I was talking about that little girl has to live 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:37.809
 using challenges to get to the end for the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.100
 advertiser I lost all the certainty that 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.699
 help the grudge were marked in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.470
 presences 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.380
 a nightmare can not be true 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.850
 who is who 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.140
 where rubÃ©n 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.140
 I begin to say 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.320

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.300

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.720
 I lied 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.509
 then in my face reflection betray 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.380
 in front of the ghost your good tired voice 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.950
 because I because it's because I'm 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.390
 asking answers we want not only 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.649
 over time it will be a laziness you will not 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 it can be true 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.049
 to slide 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 if they are removed 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.570
 Mix 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.569

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.610
 if you walk 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.770
 when he only listens 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:45.870
 found in ideas 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.049
 my assistant 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.060
 to the full force 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.060
 walking 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.550

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.620

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.740
 Y 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.970

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.970
 of the mind 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.709

 it 's ready, you're not missing 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.550
 absolutely nothing I want to tell you something 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.820
 when you came to the casting you sang 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.759
 wonderful you sang cute but what 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.349
 you are the improvement that I see today is 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.630
 amazing and I want to thank the 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.449
 teachers of the academy who have been 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.650
 working with you and I'm sure 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.590
 I'm sure that you 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.130
 improvement is due to them also you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.560
 I congratulate only I have to tell you 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.210
 repeat you are ready to leave 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.160
 running and burn your disk I have a 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.570
 ask more than you and your band do 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 I hate when I made the comment the other 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.300
 day a little bit they called me static 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.490
 they called is not true but then if 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.460
 you do not want a solo career 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.990
 because it comes alone 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:10.320
 for this would be monster 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:13.750
 I do not want to tell her that she's alone 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.340
 Holds the stage up without a band and 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.260
 without music you are suddenly a layer of 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.830
 people 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.470
 go forward very well the truth 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.240
 is that I find it super versatile 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.250
 incredible its activity as improvements every 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.300
 day and I think that's the scenario are not 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.100
 the teachers that is also the 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.260
 stage to be every day here is a 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.970
 wonderful training and good the 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.240

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.190
 contestant I'll tell you 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.690
 fundamentally because I what I have 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.520
 lived with everyone is that everyone has had 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.290
 At least a week of suffering 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.590
 frightening that you have really questioned 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.820
 your needs his desire to be here you 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:00.400
 you drink it with soda and that, so if 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.010
 you are a great great great interpreter 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.860
 because in truth life you take it with 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.610
 humor and humor is sunny and humor 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.400

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.960
