00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.020
 Good afternoon. Welcome to the workshop. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.180
 open the mech 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 here we have a problem in the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.030
 vehicle 206 206 if engine here at 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.859
 feature of it is that the uniforms 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.630
 occurs when the car reaches up to 1,800 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.140
 rpm can be seen that a failed 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.269
 acceleration up to that engine speed 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.400
 we conclude that we should have 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 disassembled collector for 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.420
 tpi 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.500
 the unit of oil enters the form of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 causing a small fault 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 we have seen here the point to run 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.770
 Synchronism absorbs valve control 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.219
 a crankshaft the point is correct 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.110
 some failure can also be obtained 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 nozzle cleaning has taken place 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 now let's check a cleaning that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.890
 was made here in your baby and today she 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.510
 placed it is installed inside the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.000
 collector from the intake manifold to the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.450
 intake manifold and that part 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.380
 putting closure because now 6 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.930
 silver and is called butterfly body 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.540
 It was installed some components of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.670
 air pressure sensor 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 along with it also has one that the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.790
 butterfly here 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 Actually, I'm going from error if I 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.960
 butterfly flame air intake 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 as soon as the vehicle receives a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.009
 acceleration and the butterfly opens in 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.509
 because the goal can rain 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.509
 a little better to preview 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.140
 the ground class ab at the time of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.910
 acceleration it opens 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.900
 if the fuel is injected more 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.460
 fuel needs more air intake 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.290
 the fuel becomes more agile if 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.590
 burn according to the air mixture 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.520
 we have already cleaned the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.850
 square 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.100
 in this piece you see here it rains 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:09.190
 a little because then this black part 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.270
 is the drive mechanism of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.580
 acceleration in case the function of it is to open 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 the butterfly for its due to 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.570
 federation 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.490
 because then this people here he arrived 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.490
 here with a constant failure 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.430
 already been passed modules was passed a 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.920
 on the module whose 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.100
 management was passed by the computer and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.709
 the whole system accuses coke but 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.680
 suggests it will not detect so we opted 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.600
 for dismantling this game by the wing 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.110
 valve cap where the beautiful ones go 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.230
 ignition coil sounds cable 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.890
 You also see that you are seeing my hand. 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.710
 here o 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.610
 the ignition coil 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.070
 also a whip as a connection with 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.790
 these parts are you that are connected to the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.880
 tpi and it 's there inside the port goes there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.880
 inside the collector's country 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.640
 here we have the battery disconnected from the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.860
 disconnected battery it is used to 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.600
 prescribe the module if the module will receive 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.730
 an error message 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.590
 so we left him for at least two hours 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.350
 off and make the connection small 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.920
 It is possibly the will that will exist 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.100
 shall be made after the checks 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.380
 hole cleaning is where the 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.900
 module is seeing every day here 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.300
 this part was used is a module going 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 inside the collector 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.130
 he then said that there is personal 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.570
 hopeful that it is terrible that you 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.100
 find fault with it was a is a head 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.280
 A rusty nail for you has to 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.200
 clean it 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.420
 may then here we talk to the workshop 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.290
 open the mec only small houses that the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.000
 People show you the way I think. 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.340
 who will now be very satisfied 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.450
 when the car is good even up 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.480
 the woman in the car can not be talking 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.340
 the woman who falls perfect condition 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.410
 staff leaving from here already 11 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.079
 big hug to everyone who checked the 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.730
 footage that may possibly have a 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.730
 vehicle when doing these problems 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.750
 Thank you, everyone has a good time. 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.750
 Night and a good rest to everyone.
