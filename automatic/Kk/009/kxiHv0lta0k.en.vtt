Wrestlemania<00:01:00.580> right<00:01:00.730> on<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.210> it<00:01:02.020> says<00:01:03.089> big

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
Wrestlemania right on it and it says big

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.190 
Wrestlemania right on it and it says big
show<00:01:04.950> Triple<00:01:05.950> H<00:01:06.480> John<00:01:07.480> Cena<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:07.870> Randy<00:01:07.960> were

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
show Triple H John Cena and Randy were

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.960 
show Triple H John Cena and Randy were
and<00:01:08.350> Daniel<00:01:08.620> Bryan<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.640> return<00:01:09.910> of

and Daniel Bryan and the return of

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.720 
and Daniel Bryan and the return of
adista<00:01:10.960> so

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
adista so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.240 
adista so
I<00:01:13.790> think<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.810> will<00:01:14.960> actually<00:01:15.290> return<00:01:15.770> at

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
I think that it will actually return at

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.710 
I think that it will actually return at
the<00:01:16.280> Royal<00:01:16.610> Rumble<00:01:16.700> because<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.360> world<00:01:17.480> was

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
the Royal Rumble because the world was

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.840 
the Royal Rumble because the world was
in<00:01:17.990> 26<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.530> January<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:19.310> that's<00:01:19.550> not<00:01:19.670> too<00:01:19.730> far

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
in 26 in January so that's not too far

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.210 
in 26 in January so that's not too far
off<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.510> think

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
off I think

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.700 
off I think
that's<00:01:21.610> like<00:01:21.790> all<00:01:22.480> right<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:22.720> that's<00:01:22.840> 26<00:01:23.440> that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
that's like all right so that's 26 that

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.399 
that's like all right so that's 26 that
means<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.040> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
means it's the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.540 
means it's the
fifth<00:01:26.060> second<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.469> ninth

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
fifth second and then the ninth

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.840 
fifth second and then the ninth
so<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.330> only<00:01:30.390> three<00:01:30.750> weeks<00:01:30.780> after<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> world

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
so it's only three weeks after the world

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
so it's only three weeks after the world
so<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.420> obviously<00:01:34.020> he's<00:01:34.440> not<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so he was obviously he's not going to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.650 
so he was obviously he's not going to
return<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> house<00:01:35.310> show<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.360> picking

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
return on a house show so I'm picking

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.240 
return on a house show so I'm picking
out<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:36.990> picking<00:01:37.470> him<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.740> return<00:01:38.010> at<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
out so I'm picking him to return at the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.140 
out so I'm picking him to return at the
rumble<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.200> think<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
rumble I think that this would be the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.820 
rumble I think that this would be the
same<00:01:42.390> time<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.810> Lesnar<00:01:43.170> comes<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> at

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
same time that Lesnar comes back is at

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.940 
same time that Lesnar comes back is at
the<00:01:43.920> problem<00:01:44.250> too<00:01:44.510> because<00:01:45.770> that's<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> only

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the problem too because that's the only

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
the problem too because that's the only
opponent<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.730> can<00:01:47.910> see<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> facing<00:01:48.600> at

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
opponent that I can see the facing at

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
opponent that I can see the facing at
WrestleMania<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.620> is<00:01:50.070> Brock<00:01:50.940> Lesnar<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.800> mean

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
WrestleMania is is Brock Lesnar I mean

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
WrestleMania is is Brock Lesnar I mean
there's<00:01:54.360> no<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.659> else<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.930> he<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.140> really

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
there's no one else that he could really

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.350 
there's no one else that he could really
feud<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.040> he<00:01:56.340> already<00:01:56.579> faced<00:01:56.850> Cena<00:01:57.149> at

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360

definitely<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:02.080> ceiling<00:03:03.080> real<00:03:03.260> bro<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:03.950> many

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
definitely and ceiling real bro so many

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.589 
definitely and ceiling real bro so many
opponent<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.700> they<00:03:04.910> could<00:03:05.060> have<00:03:05.180> one<00:03:05.420> right

now<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:07.010> don't<00:03:07.520> think<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.880> would<00:03:07.970> come<00:03:08.060> back

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209

now so I don't think it would come back
to<00:03:08.270> face<00:03:08.480> right<00:03:08.720> back<00:03:08.870> either<00:03:10.120> two<00:03:11.120> or<00:03:11.150> more

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450
