much<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> start<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.920> competitive<00:02:05.509> did<00:02:06.509> not

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
much at the start so competitive did not

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.889 
much at the start so competitive did not

sprint<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.579> know<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:18.510> sprint<00:02:18.900> does<00:02:19.500> take

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
the way of mechanic that you know makes

the way of mechanic that you know makes
it<00:02:22.140> competitive<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.489> used<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.849> a

it competitive but it can be used in a
different<00:02:24.359> way<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.439> we'll<00:02:25.650> begin<00:02:26.159> that<00:02:26.400> down

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
different way so we'll begin that down

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.629 
different way so we'll begin that down

to that last topic soon armor abilities

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.709 
to that last topic soon armor abilities
does<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:30.030> away<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.420> feel<00:02:31.079> or<00:02:31.549> competitive

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
does take away a feel or competitive

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
and armor abilities a power weapon more

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.530 
and armor abilities a power weapon more
likely<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.129> halo<00:03:38.669> reach<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.030> did<00:03:39.269> see<00:03:39.510> that

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
likely and halo reach you did see that

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.929 
likely and halo reach you did see that
and<00:03:39.900> some<00:03:40.199> maps<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.799> armor<00:03:41.189> ability<00:03:41.579> would<00:03:41.729> be

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
and some maps the armor ability would be

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.210 
and some maps the armor ability would be
a<00:03:42.090> power<00:03:42.569> weapon<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.349> would<00:03:43.409> be<00:03:43.620> advantage

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
a power weapon it would be advantage

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.890 
a power weapon it would be advantage
because<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.759> could<00:03:44.970> actually<00:03:45.150> sprint<00:03:45.720> across

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
because you could actually sprint across

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.020 
because you could actually sprint across
map<00:03:46.229> and<00:03:46.500> get<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:46.979> shot<00:03:47.370> off<00:03:47.400> because<00:03:47.879> you

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
map and get that shot off because you

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.210 
map and get that shot off because you
would<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.329> only<00:03:48.359> player<00:03:48.689> to<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.109> or<00:03:49.259> you

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
would be the only player to do it or you

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.069 
would be the only player to do it or you
had<00:03:50.400> thruster<00:03:50.879> pack<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.540> were<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.049> only

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
had thruster pack and you were the only

two<00:04:26.580> weapons<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.090> would<00:04:27.360> be<00:04:27.509> more<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.900> mine

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
two weapons that would be more in mine

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.159 
two weapons that would be more in mine
would<00:04:28.560> be<00:04:28.680> Adam<00:04:29.009> or<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.490> br<00:04:29.789> if<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.449> return<00:04:30.600> of

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
would be Adam or and a br if a return of

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.189 
would be Adam or and a br if a return of
a<00:04:31.380> SMG<00:04:32.250> would<00:04:32.610> turn<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.120> would<00:04:33.300> be<00:04:33.449> probably<00:04:33.690> an

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
a SMG would turn it would be probably an

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.330 
a SMG would turn it would be probably an
SMG<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.949> map<00:04:35.130> somewhere<00:04:36.650> there<00:04:37.650> was<00:04:37.830> very

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
SMG on the map somewhere there was very

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.370 
SMG on the map somewhere there was very
big<00:04:38.610> competitive<00:04:39.180> stuff<00:04:39.449> coming<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.900> for<00:04:40.169> halo

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
big competitive stuff coming on for halo

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.550 
big competitive stuff coming on for halo
5<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:41.310> they<00:04:41.580> kept<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.000> beyond<00:04:42.300> EMR<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.870> PBR

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
5 and they kept the beyond EMR the PBR

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.129 
5 and they kept the beyond EMR the PBR
and<00:04:43.590> DMR<00:04:43.979> would<00:04:44.400> have<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.759> load<00:04:44.940> outs<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.479> halo

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
and DMR would have to load outs in halo

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.010 
and DMR would have to load outs in halo
5<00:04:46.410> competitive<00:04:47.009> it<00:04:47.520> would<00:04:47.669> have<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.850> br<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.810> a

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
5 competitive it would have a br and a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.980 
5 competitive it would have a br and a
DMR<00:04:49.440> I<00:04:49.500> would<00:04:49.680> say<00:04:49.889> if<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.610> guys<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.840> would

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
DMR I would say if you guys it would

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.439 
DMR I would say if you guys it would
really<00:04:52.380> change<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.889> aspect<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.550> halo<00:04:53.910> 5<00:04:54.120> I

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
really change the aspect of halo 5 I

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.480 
really change the aspect of halo 5 I
believe<00:04:55.139> this<00:04:55.320> is<00:04:55.380> how<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.620> could<00:04:55.889> make<00:04:56.280> halo

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
believe this is how you could make halo

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.730 
believe this is how you could make halo
5<00:04:56.789> show<00:04:56.970> competitive<00:04:57.570> because<00:04:58.080> if<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.530> have

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
5 show competitive because if you have

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.360 
5 show competitive because if you have
the<00:04:59.009> two<00:04:59.340> precise<00:05:00.330> weapons<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.470> were<00:05:02.130> in

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
the two precise weapons that were in

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.180 
the two precise weapons that were in
halo<00:05:02.729> reach<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.240> halo<00:05:03.599> 3<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.349> you<00:05:04.770> take<00:05:05.009> them

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
halo reach and halo 3 and you take them

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.770 
halo reach and halo 3 and you take them
and<00:05:05.430> clean<00:05:05.610> them<00:05:05.669> this<00:05:06.090> could<00:05:06.300> make<00:05:06.479> a<00:05:06.509> very

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
and clean them this could make a very

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.900 
and clean them this could make a very
competitive<00:05:07.080> game<00:05:07.470> including<00:05:08.430> having<00:05:08.729> the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
competitive game including having the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.330 
competitive game including having the
armor<00:05:09.300> buildings<00:05:09.630> as<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.870> power<00:05:10.349> weapon<00:05:10.740> would

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
armor buildings as a power weapon would

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.310 
armor buildings as a power weapon would
be<00:05:11.460> even<00:05:11.820> more<00:05:11.940> better<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.419> make<00:05:12.870> sure<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.199> go

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
be even more better and make sure you go

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.230 
be even more better and make sure you go
back<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.650> halo<00:05:13.889> reach<00:05:14.099> design<00:05:14.580> sniper

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
back to the halo reach design sniper

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.490 
back to the halo reach design sniper
rifle<00:05:15.599> because<00:05:15.660> that<00:05:15.960> thing<00:05:15.990> is<00:05:16.289> amazing

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
rifle because that thing is amazing

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.080 
rifle because that thing is amazing
because<00:05:16.800> i<00:05:16.979> was<00:05:17.099> on<00:05:17.190> halo<00:05:17.460> reach<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.759> i<00:05:17.849> hit

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
because i was on halo reach and i hit

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.360 
because i was on halo reach and i hit
some<00:05:18.300> no<00:05:18.479> scope<00:05:18.750> was<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:18.990> another<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.530> also

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
some no scope was that another and also

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.279 
some no scope was that another and also
other<00:05:21.030> things<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.870> we're<00:05:22.050> going<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.199> be

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
other things that we're going to be

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.510 
other things that we're going to be
talking<00:05:22.410> about<00:05:22.590> is<00:05:22.800> going<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.979> be<00:05:23.099> later<00:05:23.340> in

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
talking about is going to be later in

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.800 
talking about is going to be later in
videos<00:05:23.940> about<00:05:24.479> halo<00:05:24.720> 5<00:05:24.960> competitive<00:05:25.560> but<00:05:26.810> they

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
videos about halo 5 competitive but they

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.990 
videos about halo 5 competitive but they
say<00:05:28.020> about<00:05:28.199> a<00:05:28.349> br<00:05:28.770> nadeem<00:05:29.099> or<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.639> difference

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
say about a br nadeem or the difference

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.719 
say about a br nadeem or the difference
is<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.210> one<00:05:30.630> has<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.840> longer<00:05:31.110> scope<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:32.039> how

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
is that one has a longer scope so how

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.990 
is that one has a longer scope so how
does<00:05:32.789> that<00:05:32.970> change<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.229> DMR<00:05:35.039> say<00:05:35.490> two

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
does that change so a DMR say two

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.510 
does that change so a DMR say two
players<00:05:36.300> let's<00:05:37.080> say<00:05:37.199> four<00:05:37.470> before<00:05:37.620> two

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
players let's say four before two

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.670 
players let's say four before two
players<00:05:38.789> are<00:05:38.970> on<00:05:39.150> BR<00:05:39.510> two<00:05:39.810> players<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.260> DMR

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
players are on BR two players on DMR

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.950 
players are on BR two players on DMR
that<00:05:41.010> means<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.940> your<00:05:42.180> players<00:05:42.449> can<00:05:42.690> sit<00:05:42.930> back

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
that means to your players can sit back
