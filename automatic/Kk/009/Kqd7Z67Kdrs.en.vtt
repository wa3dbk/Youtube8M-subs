face seen her twice and lost and then

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.290

seen it moved on to Mark Henry so
hopefully<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:22.320> doesn't<00:02:22.590> pull<00:02:22.950> Ryback<00:02:23.400> out

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
hopefully this doesn't pull Ryback out

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.890 
hopefully this doesn't pull Ryback out
of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.910> championship<00:02:24.660> matchup<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:26.900> I'm

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
of the championship matchup but I'm

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
of the championship matchup but I'm
hoping<00:02:28.290> he<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.550> back<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.209> because

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
thing and I mean I really would like to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.330 
thing and I mean I really would like to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
see Ryback his champion the only thing I

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.720 
see Ryback his champion the only thing I
don't<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.730> right<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.300> about<00:02:40.200> Ryback<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
don't like right like about Ryback is

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.710 
don't like right like about Ryback is
his<00:02:42.090> mic<00:02:42.420> skills<00:02:42.630> aren't<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.200> greatest<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.690> I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
his mic skills aren't the greatest so I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.050 
his mic skills aren't the greatest so I
don't<00:02:45.930> know<00:02:46.080> if<00:02:46.380> he<00:02:46.860> was<00:02:47.070> champion<00:02:47.640> how<00:02:47.760> long

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
don't know if he was champion how long

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.090 
don't know if he was champion how long
he<00:02:48.330> would<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.660> champion<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.350> mean<00:02:49.770> that's<00:02:49.920> one

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
he would be champion I mean that's one

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.600 
he would be champion I mean that's one
thing<00:02:50.280> Cena<00:02:50.640> has<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.239> Mark<00:02:51.930> Henry<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:53.370> mean

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
thing Cena has and Mark Henry and I mean

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.030 
thing Cena has and Mark Henry and I mean
even<00:02:53.850> Jericho<00:02:54.330> their<00:02:54.989> mic<00:02:55.260> skills<00:02:55.650> are

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
even Jericho their mic skills are

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.199 
even Jericho their mic skills are
excellent<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:58.310> Ryback<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.340> kind<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.790> gets<00:03:00.060> on

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
excellent so Ryback just kind of gets on

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.830 
excellent so Ryback just kind of gets on
there<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.570> he<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:00.930> rambles<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.840> don't

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
there and he just rambles on I don't

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.750 
there and he just rambles on I don't
think<00:03:04.019> he's<00:03:04.170> got<00:03:04.410> very<00:03:05.130> good<00:03:05.220> mic<00:03:05.459> skills

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
think he's got very good mic skills

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
think he's got very good mic skills
maybe<00:03:06.450> someone<00:03:06.780> else<00:03:06.810> does<00:03:07.140> i<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:07.470> know<00:03:07.560> but

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
maybe someone else does i don't know but

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.650 
maybe someone else does i don't know but
i<00:03:08.180> think<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:10.290> matchup<00:03:10.830> has<00:03:10.950> nothing<00:03:11.660> for

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
i think this matchup has nothing for

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.590 
i think this matchup has nothing for
Ryback<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:14.190> really<00:03:14.790> does<00:03:15.030> nothing<00:03:15.420> for

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
Ryback it really does nothing for

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.990 
Ryback it really does nothing for
Jericho<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.140> mean<00:03:16.470> he's<00:03:16.739> he's<00:03:17.549> not<00:03:17.760> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.910> be

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
Jericho I mean he's he's not going to be

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.320 
Jericho I mean he's he's not going to be
champion<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.980> they're<00:03:20.910> not<00:03:21.030> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> give

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
champion like they're not going to give

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.699 
champion like they're not going to give
him<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.510> championship<00:03:22.049> like<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.320> gave<00:03:22.470> rock

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
him the championship like they gave rock

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.780 
him the championship like they gave rock
the<00:03:22.890> championship<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:25.250> think<00:03:26.250> they<00:03:26.370> gave<00:03:26.549> rock

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the championship I think they gave rock

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.009 
the championship I think they gave rock
the<00:03:26.940> championship<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:27.810> he<00:03:27.900> had

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
the championship is because he had

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.370 
the championship is because he had
movies<00:03:28.380> coming<00:03:28.620> out<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.810> he's<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> big<00:03:31.110> draw

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
movies coming out and he's a big draw

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.729 
movies coming out and he's a big draw
for<00:03:31.730> Wrestlemania<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.850> all<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.180> stuff

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
for Wrestlemania and all that stuff

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.830 
for Wrestlemania and all that stuff
Jericho's<00:03:34.739> always<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> big<00:03:35.220> draw<00:03:35.489> as<00:03:35.549> well<00:03:35.940> but

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
Jericho's always a big draw as well but

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.180 
Jericho's always a big draw as well but
I<00:03:38.269> just<00:03:39.269> don't<00:03:39.600> think<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.170> he's<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
I just don't think that he's in the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.449 
I just don't think that he's in the
running<00:03:41.549> for<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.269> title<00:03:42.709> mainly<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.370> know

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
running for that title mainly you know

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.920 
running for that title mainly you know
he<00:03:44.700> wasn't<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> either<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.630> money<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
he wasn't in either of the money the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.960 
he wasn't in either of the money the
bank<00:03:46.140> matches<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:47.040> now<00:03:47.160> he's<00:03:47.370> facing<00:03:47.640> off

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
bank matches and now he's facing off

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.310 
bank matches and now he's facing off
against<00:03:48.269> Ryback<00:03:48.980> we<00:03:49.980> might<00:03:50.220> see<00:03:50.610> some<00:03:51.320> more

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
against Ryback we might see some more

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.800 
against Ryback we might see some more
matches<00:03:52.769> between<00:03:52.950> Ryback<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.760> Jericho<00:03:54.209> we

and someone vs jericho and someone else

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.780 
and someone vs jericho and someone else
I'm<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.210> roles<00:04:00.540> but<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:02.160> i<00:04:02.310> said<00:04:02.340> i'm<00:04:02.730> not

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I'm on roles but like i said i'm not

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.280 
I'm on roles but like i said i'm not
seeing<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.630> big<00:04:03.990> feud<00:04:04.920> here<00:04:05.630> between<00:04:06.630> these<00:04:07.050> two

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
seeing a big feud here between these two

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.559 
seeing a big feud here between these two
gentlemen<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:08.069> I<00:04:08.310> do<00:04:08.640> think<00:04:09.000> Ryback<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.450> going

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
gentlemen so I do think Ryback is going

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.449 
gentlemen so I do think Ryback is going
to<00:04:09.630> get<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> win<00:04:10.080> this<00:04:10.620> will<00:04:10.830> help<00:04:10.920> push<00:04:11.190> him<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
to get the win this will help push him a

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.670 
to get the win this will help push him a
little<00:04:11.490> bit<00:04:11.730> further<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.120> think<00:04:12.240> into<00:04:12.810> possibly

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
little bit further I think into possibly

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.559 
little bit further I think into possibly
that<00:04:13.950> heavyweight<00:04:14.520> championship<00:04:15.090> bracket

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
that heavyweight championship bracket

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.560 
that heavyweight championship bracket
maybe<00:04:16.049> over<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.590> Smackdown<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.430> not<00:04:17.579> sure<00:04:17.820> but

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
maybe over on Smackdown I'm not sure but
