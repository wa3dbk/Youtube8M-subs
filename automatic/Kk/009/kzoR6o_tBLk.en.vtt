00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
an eye thing in the handle so it must be

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.780 
an eye thing in the handle so it must be
Fred<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.729> George's<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> next<00:01:14.040> wand<00:01:14.430> is

Fred or George's want the next wand is
the<00:01:15.270> vine<00:01:15.509> carved<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:17.119> its<00:01:19.700> Hermione's<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the vine carved one its Hermione's one

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.030 
the vine carved one its Hermione's one
from<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.020> most<00:01:22.259> recent<00:01:23.060> movies

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.930 

probably<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.190> they<00:01:29.430> change<00:01:29.760> the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
probably because they change the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.520 
probably because they change the
director<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> them<00:01:31.050> I<00:01:32.330> like<00:01:33.330> it's<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
director of them I like it's just a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.690 
director of them I like it's just a
straight<00:01:34.890> shaft<00:01:35.310> vines<00:01:36.560> but<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:38.220> thing<00:01:38.490> about

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
straight shaft vines but one thing about

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.400 
straight shaft vines but one thing about
this<00:01:38.880> wand<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.380> has<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.800> number<00:01:44.370> 10<00:01:44.760> at<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:46.170> end

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
this wand it has a number 10 at the end

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.640 
this wand it has a number 10 at the end
of<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.180> know<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.390> can't<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.500> it's

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
of it I know you can't see it but it's

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.270 
of it I know you can't see it but it's
there<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.510> hopefully<00:01:51.510> I'll<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.830> video<00:01:53.040> on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
there and hopefully I'll make a video on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.530 
there and hopefully I'll make a video on
it<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> reason<00:01:54.960> why<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.970> did<00:01:57.330> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it now the reason why it did that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.830 
it now the reason why it did that
because<00:01:58.230> the<00:01:59.220> Alamance<00:01:59.640> master<00:02:00.210> lawmakers

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
because the Alamance master lawmakers

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.070 
because the Alamance master lawmakers
themselves<00:02:02.300> likes<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.540> leave<00:02:03.750> their

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
themselves likes to leave their

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.170 
themselves likes to leave their
signature<00:02:04.800> marks<00:02:05.160> so<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.520> number<00:02:05.790> tends

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
signature marks so this number tends

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.270 
signature marks so this number tends
like<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.840> wand<00:02:07.590> makers<00:02:08.010> signature<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.920> next

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
like the wand makers signature the next

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.650 
like the wand makers signature the next
