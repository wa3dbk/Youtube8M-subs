00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
needs and that means that I don't feel

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.740 
needs and that means that I don't feel
like<00:02:06.409> he's<00:02:07.409> missing<00:02:07.890> anything<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:09.390> actually

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
like he's missing anything I actually

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
like he's missing anything I actually
can't<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.259> think<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> anything<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.039> guy

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
can't really think of anything this guy

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.500 
can't really think of anything this guy
would<00:02:11.459> need<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.879> side<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.450> know

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
would need that side of I don't know

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.880 
would need that side of I don't know
maybe<00:02:12.660> some<00:02:12.900> common<00:02:13.349> hands

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
maybe some common hands

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
maybe some common hands

calm<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.680> dude<00:02:16.860> was<00:02:17.069> fired<00:02:17.880> up<00:02:18.150> that's<00:02:18.390> why<00:02:18.510> he

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
calm the dude was fired up that's why he

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600 
calm the dude was fired up that's why he
was<00:02:18.720> able<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.959> tame<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.590> spirit<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.160> 'get<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
core or something I just made that up

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.540 
core or something I just made that up
um<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> SH<00:02:25.680> figures<00:02:26.040> by<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.190> way<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
um with the SH figures by the way on the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.550 
um with the SH figures by the way on the
wrists<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:27.030> kind<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.209> interesting<00:02:27.420> how<00:02:27.630> due

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
wrists it's kind of interesting how due

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.199 
wrists it's kind of interesting how due
to<00:02:28.709> how<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.830> wrist<00:02:29.100> joint<00:02:29.250> works<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
to how the wrist joint works you

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.400 
to how the wrist joint works you
actually<00:02:30.480> sort<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.990> do<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.260> bit

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
actually sort of have to do a little bit

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.510 
actually sort of have to do a little bit
of<00:02:31.470> work<00:02:31.680> especially<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:32.430> holding

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
of work especially when you're holding

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.790 
of work especially when you're holding
bladed<00:02:33.030> weapons<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.570> alter<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.440> way<00:02:34.560> this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
bladed weapons to alter the way this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.490 
bladed weapons to alter the way this
swivel<00:02:35.070> works<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.209> goes<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.900> down<00:02:37.140> like

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
swivel works so it goes up and down like

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.300 
swivel works so it goes up and down like
this<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.490> once<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.230> reach<00:02:41.010> up

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
this but once you do you can reach up

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.330 
this but once you do you can reach up
and<00:02:41.489> take<00:02:41.730> hold<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> blades<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.280> go<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and take hold of the blades and go to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.790 
and take hold of the blades and go to
work<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> other<00:02:46.080> weaknesses<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
work now one of the other weaknesses of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.210 
work now one of the other weaknesses of
this<00:02:47.459> sculpt<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.060> will<00:02:48.300> admit<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:49.140> more<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.920> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
this sculpt I will admit is more so of a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.640 
this sculpt I will admit is more so of a
structural<00:02:50.820> bit<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.780> stability<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.500> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
structural bit of stability and that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.630 
structural bit of stability and that
would<00:02:52.830> be<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.370> shoulder<00:02:53.700> pads<00:02:53.940> themselves

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
would be the shoulder pads themselves

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.949 
would be the shoulder pads themselves
the<00:02:56.640> thing<00:02:56.790> about<00:02:56.970> them<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.330> they're<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> little

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the thing about them is they're a little

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.960 
the thing about them is they're a little
bit<00:02:58.080> floppy<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.830> especially<00:02:59.670> when<00:02:59.880> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
bit floppy and especially when the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.310 
bit floppy and especially when the
blades<00:03:00.239> are<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.540> them<00:03:00.720> they<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:00.989> sometimes

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
blades are on them they can sometimes

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.530 
blades are on them they can sometimes
just<00:03:01.350> pop<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.160> at<00:03:02.340> very<00:03:02.519> inopportune<00:03:02.970> times

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
just pop up at very inopportune times

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.300 
just pop up at very inopportune times
and<00:03:03.900> when<00:03:04.380> there's<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> blade<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.040> just

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and when there's a blade on there just

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.500 
and when there's a blade on there just
sticking<00:03:05.519> all<00:03:05.700> over<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> place<00:03:06.269> it's

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
sticking all over the place it's

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.880 
sticking all over the place it's
