00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.280
 let's see someone explain to me 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.090
 since when halloween is celebrated in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.750
 Spain 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.140
 it is never the day of all the saints 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.100
 and has to watch videos on youtube of recipes 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.500
 A) Yes 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.010
 since when we in all 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.250
 saints we eat cupcakes I'm fed up 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.400
 to see cupcakes muffins brownies 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.950
 decorated with a grave with a ghost 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.790
 with a living dead a donut 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.790
 dripping blood 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.920
 but if that does not get here because 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.660
 we already have carnival though 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 I also understand that we 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.090
 we aim at any bombing and for 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.780
 that's me here to put a solution 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.610
 to this madness that is leaving us now 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.290
 of the hands so let's do what 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.790
 that truly eats the day of 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.810
 all the saints at least here in 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.880
 catalonia that are panellets and for that 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.369
 I have the best company that is my mother 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.070
 That's me, they're very good at 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.440
 the packages and ice cream with milk 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.050
 it was red 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.490
 and she learns very well also 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.560
 well you will see that it is very easy 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.920
 that although it carries some ingredients like that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.240
 for example potato and it looks like it's going to be 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 something 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 with a pout 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.030
 the truth that they are sweet because they carry 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.880
 but they carry more sugar than that and it's the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.400
 mom makes them and I the cases more or less 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.160
 it's been like that and it's what you usually 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.460
 eat here traditionally and wi-fi 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.460
 years 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 go figure 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.290
 what I'm going to eat here for the 31 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.290
 then 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.560
 for the dough we will need a potato 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.720
 medium 200 grams of sugar and 250 of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.970
 ground almonds and to decorate alone 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.480
 we're going to need almond nuts 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.849
 chopped coconut grated and an egg 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.860
 first and foremost of everything is to cook the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.870
 potato and let it cool down a 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.260
 I 'm just a little bit so that later it will be easier for us 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.840
 peel it and do not burn it I say it for 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.849
 your good I have to tell you that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.910
 we knew two potatoes but that 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.739
 finally we only use one because of 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.170
 a medium sized potato came out 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.170
 about thirty panellets 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.190
 and let's get down to the mass 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.750
 to smear the potato very well with a 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.600
 fork 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.210
 next we are going to add the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.040
 ground almond and let's continue 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.810
 mixing everything very well let's go 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 adding in just a little bit at a time 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.770
 and finally we are going to add the sugar 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.880
 that this is going to make the mass 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.850
 soften lose that crumb effect and you 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.190
 so you see your compact 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.440
 and now we have our mass ready 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.940
 to make the panellets simply 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.560
 we have to let it cool because 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.870
 the colder the easier it is going to be 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.550
 work it and we put it in the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.920
 fridge and we use it the day after 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.920
 but you do not have to wait that long either 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.190
 and the mechanism is very very simple 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.390
 we just take a small portion 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.630
 we give it a rounded shape 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.730
 we bathe in the clear and then we can 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.220
 start hitting on the pine nuts of a 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.220
 It is a bit cute for a cookie 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.860
 and to prevent the panel from sticking 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.000
 to the tray we are going to put a little 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.000
 of flour at the base 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.260
 and that's how beautiful they are simply 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.910
 we have to repeat the same process in 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.490
 the case of the almonds we are going to 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.830
 give it the shape of a croquet and there what 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.510
 we go back to bathe in the clear 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.720
 and the batter in the almond 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.190
 we put back a little flour 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.190
 at the base so that it does not stick 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.170
 and for coconut we will give you the 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.240
 shape of a pacifier or a nipple 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.270
 It depends on how hot 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.100
 your mind go back to bathe it in the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.100
 clear and we lower it in the coconut 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.030
 and we will use a flat brush where 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.490
 synthetic hair 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.440
 and with this brush that said then we are going to 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.530
 start painting all the panellets with 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.060
 the egg yolk let's leave for 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.540
 at the end the coconut panellets because yes 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.030
 you are not going to pringar all the brush 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.490
 and we take them to the oven about 180 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.770
 degrees in grill mode for about 10-15 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.320
 minutes just to be gild 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.470
 because remember that the potato was already 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.440
 cooked 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.570
 and that's how nice they look good 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.540
 it has not been my mother I can you 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.950
 ensure that they are delicious and I hope 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.270
 that you put them into practice and that you 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.100
 stop so many cupcakes 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.530
 and if you have any doubt, leave it 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.840
 down in the comments that mom does not 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.300
 what is going to solve it, mom goes happy 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.010
 will put the laptop and will answer 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.370
 to all the questions yeah well I 'll 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.800
 I said she and she 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.520
