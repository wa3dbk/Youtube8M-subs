00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899 
when it ends and if it ends it's going
to<00:01:03.690> end<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> pile<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.280> he's<00:01:05.760> in

believe that they will be their favorite
this<00:01:12.030> week<00:01:12.180> against<00:01:12.450> Arizona<00:01:13.040> clean<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.130> on

the<00:01:14.310> jet<00:01:14.490> standpoint<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.060> mean<00:01:15.240> they<00:01:15.330> still<00:01:15.570> can

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the jet standpoint I mean they still can

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.140 
the jet standpoint I mean they still can
finish<00:01:16.020> believe<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.939> least

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
finish believe it or not with a at least

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.730

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
i think a lot of it has to do with how

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.530

they finish here towards the end of the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.540 
they finish here towards the end of the
season<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.110> looks<00:02:43.320> as<00:02:43.440> if<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.890> team<00:02:44.400> has

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
season if it looks as if the team has

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.280 
season if it looks as if the team has
given<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.120> him<00:02:45.330> much<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290

on<00:02:48.690> Andy<00:02:49.440> Reid<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.680> think<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.160> owners<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.640> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
on Andy Reid I think the owners got to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.220 
on Andy Reid I think the owners got to
make<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> decision<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.750> whether<00:02:51.990> or<00:02:52.170> not

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
