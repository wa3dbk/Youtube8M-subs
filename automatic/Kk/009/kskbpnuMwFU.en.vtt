00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and you will need to take caution as to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
and you will need to take caution as to
how<00:01:38.939> far<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> explore<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.170> could<00:01:40.320> run<00:01:40.470> out

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
how far you explore as you could run out

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
how far you explore as you could run out
of<00:01:40.619> water<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.729> squad<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.299> wind<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
of water for your squad or wind up in a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920 
of water for your squad or wind up in a
radioactive<00:01:43.680> zone<00:01:43.860> which<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.399> kill<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.930> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
radioactive zone which will kill you you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
radioactive zone which will kill you you
will<00:01:45.960> run<00:01:46.259> into<00:01:46.320> Oasis<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.220> though<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
will run into Oasis as though as you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.999 
will run into Oasis as though as you
walk<00:01:48.329> around<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.899> give<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.350> chance<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
walk around which give you a chance to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.679 
walk around which give you a chance to
refill<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.850> squad<00:01:51.030> members<00:01:51.450> water

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
refill all of your squad members water

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.200 
refill all of your squad members water
so<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.470> travel<00:01:52.710> further<00:01:53.119> once<00:01:54.119> you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so you can then travel further once you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
so you can then travel further once you
reach<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.540> location<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.320> pop<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
reach a location it will pop up and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
reach a location it will pop up and
offer<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> chance<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.700> enter<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> area

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
offer you the chance to enter the area

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
offer you the chance to enter the area
now<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.740> said<00:01:58.770> before<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.460> combat<00:01:59.850> is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
now like I said before the combat is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.780 
now like I said before the combat is
turn-based<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> style<00:02:01.619> I'm<00:02:01.950> very

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
turn-based so it's not a style I'm very

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.690 
turn-based so it's not a style I'm very
used<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.990> enjoy<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.619> each<00:02:05.369> character

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
used to but I do enjoy it each character

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
used to but I do enjoy it each character
