the<00:01:11.010> Canadian<00:01:11.610> market<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.320> gonna

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the Canadian market I think it's gonna

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.980 
the Canadian market I think it's gonna
bring<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> other<00:01:14.220> players<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.630> even

bring the other players to be even

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
bring the other players to be even
better<00:01:16.110> also<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> think<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
better also so I think it's going to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.660 
better also so I think it's going to
create<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> lot<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> dynamic<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.170> great<00:01:20.070> positive

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
create a lot of dynamic a great positive

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
create a lot of dynamic a great positive
dynamic<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> industry<00:01:21.930> we've<00:01:22.710> been

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
dynamic in the industry we've been

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.410 
dynamic in the industry we've been
saying<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> while<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.330> going

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
saying for a while that there was going

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
saying for a while that there was going
to<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.540> consolidation<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> market<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to be consolidation in the market and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.620 
to be consolidation in the market and
and<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.430> what's<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and this is one of the what's one of the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
and this is one of the what's one of the
one<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> signs<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
one of the signs that that that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
one of the signs that that that
constellation<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.900> happening<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.500> there's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
constellation is happening there there's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.240 
constellation is happening there there's
probably<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.479> but

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
probably going to be more I will see but

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
probably going to be more I will see but
but<00:01:38.250> again<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.909> puts<00:01:39.299> us<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.570> an

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
but again I think it puts us in an

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.200 
but again I think it puts us in an
excellent<00:01:39.930> position<00:01:40.189> in<00:01:41.189> joining<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.000> said

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
excellent position in joining as I said

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.590 
excellent position in joining as I said
to<00:01:43.170> company<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> has<00:01:43.920> similar<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:45.450> of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
more brokers in the market so so so that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.280 
more brokers in the market so so so that
so<00:02:26.880> that's<00:02:27.060> why<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.600> think<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.050> no

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so that's why I think I think we have no

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.390 
so that's why I think I think we have no
intention<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.950> changing<00:02:29.840> our<00:02:30.840> broker<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
intention of changing our broker that

the broker we're dealing with with an

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
attack or with AXA and we will do that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.710 
attack or with AXA and we will do that
as<00:02:37.920> soon<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.460> transition<00:02:39.060> as<00:02:39.210> possible

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
interesting is that it gives really

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.270 
interesting is that it gives really

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
lot of thing to evaluate the operation

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.490 
lot of thing to evaluate the operation
is<00:04:52.110> read<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.770> try<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.010> keep<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.490> best<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.940> both

operations and try to make it one at the
end<00:04:58.440> of<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.620> day<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.490> so<00:05:00.390> our<00:05:00.539> expectation<00:05:01.289> is

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
end of the day so so our expectation is

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.460 
end of the day so so our expectation is
that<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.860> within<00:05:02.520> 18<00:05:03.180> months<00:05:03.570> we<00:05:04.289> will<00:05:04.410> have

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
that in within 18 months we will have

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.870 
that in within 18 months we will have
one<00:05:04.979> system<00:05:05.760> IT<00:05:06.600> system<00:05:07.229> one<00:05:07.530> platform<00:05:07.880> we

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
one system IT system one platform we

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.900 
one system IT system one platform we
will<00:05:08.910> share<00:05:09.680> locations<00:05:10.680> all<00:05:11.340> across<00:05:11.580> the

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
will share locations all across the
