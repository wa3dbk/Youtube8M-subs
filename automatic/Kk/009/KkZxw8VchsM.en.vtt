00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello it 's first I decided to you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.349
 make a video to show you 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.349
 the white edition of psp street 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:22.350
 so here it is the edition 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:33.870
 slice we can see I do not know anymore 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:36.360
 heavy here ice white inside that must 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.540
 to be very simple you have of course the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.379
 booklet with I do not know what 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.379
 the book is in all languages 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.489
 supply 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:12.010
 what a good known as 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:16.210
 this and then of course the thing for 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.660
 which gpc to buy good so here I 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.720
 am correct anyway even one on the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.520
 goods that everything is packed like that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.280
 so here is a view of behind as 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.930
 this so it says psp here I know 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.690
 not if we see it here is this so I 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.369
 will show like all my colleagues 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.150
 there it must be the small catch for 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.410
 connect on the pc is for I do not know 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.140
 what else maybe the camera 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.990
 apparently that's what takes all this 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.340
 here it is here it must be the map 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.650
 memory without which you will not be able 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.620
 not save your parts we're going to 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.190
 turned on the side here are the little ones 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:10.929
 rounded ends as usual here you 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.440
 have food is here this is the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.440
 headphone jack 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.600
 the on off button that's there I have not 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.760
 really feel like it's the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.290
 best place 1 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.060
 that's because the console is there 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.730
 play like that the button on off 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.700
 is right there so like me I 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.180
 tendency to put your hand like that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.849
 would be a bit of a pity 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.519
 So here we went all the way 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.510
 the screen you know well that's who 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.879
 is 10 cm I do not know how much here 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.780
 a small pavement that is slightly going 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:55.670
 say no touch but that's it 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.099
 it's all flat the buttons seeing yes 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.510
 we go but it's a little pressure 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.099
 or which is less well as and 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.829
 measure of time it will go down that goes 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.629
 may have been able to react 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.950
 So here we went tech prod 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.379
 direction that is crystal clear 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.799
 it's transparent what and buttons it's 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.290
 the same 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:22.159
 transparent I find frankly very 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.760
 very beautiful in white that's it changes a 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.799
 little bit of black 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.450
 if like I have a white xbox and I 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.010
 account take a white ps3 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.310
 here I prefer to stay in the head 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.400
 in the old colors with this 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.109
 I took a memory card 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.989
 I saw for a little over 13 euros 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.120
 at micromania de giga it's amply 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.560
 sufficient 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.470
 here and then micromania offers you two 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.510
 games for the purchase of the PSP which is 99 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.379
 euros at home so they offer you 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.349
 normally gran turismo 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.959
 and then when turismo collection a trick 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.379
 like that and then after apparently it's 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.840
 a choice 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.419
 I took this littlebigplanet 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.590
 I liked on ps3 I do not know what 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:14.659
 that it's worth on psp not consider the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.209
 price I get him free with the console 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.400
 gran turismo game the refourguer because 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.300
 I'm not interested in buying myself 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.130
 this at score game 1 this is god of war 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.980
 ghost of sparta 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.500
 here I have not tested at all 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.590
 here I am happy either for 6 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.870
 euros since I was taken in turismo 3 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.690
 euros and some it was my little 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.340
 video for the psp i'm not going to do any 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.060
 test and not worth it no the psp she is 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:52.210
 not out and by day 1a there a few 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:54.810
 years so that will be all over to more 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.810
 late for another video
