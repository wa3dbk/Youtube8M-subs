of<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:39.419> gear<00:04:39.780> here<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:41.310> removal<00:04:41.729> tool

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
of the gear here and the removal tool

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.709 
of the gear here and the removal tool
will<00:04:43.560> be<00:04:43.680> thread<00:04:44.009> it<00:04:44.159> into<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.400> gear<00:04:47.539> we<00:04:48.539> want

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
will be thread it into the gear we want

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.179 
will be thread it into the gear we want
to<00:04:48.780> make<00:04:48.900> sure<00:04:48.930> we<00:04:49.199> turn<00:04:49.439> this<00:04:49.590> down<00:04:49.800> all<00:04:50.069> the

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
to make sure we turn this down all the

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.640 
to make sure we turn this down all the
way<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.340> make<00:04:50.580> sure<00:04:50.759> that<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.240> thread<00:04:52.050> surface

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
way to make sure that the thread surface

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.610 
way to make sure that the thread surface
on<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.370> color<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.210> gear<00:04:54.449> itself<00:04:54.620> are

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
on the color and the gear itself are

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.830 
on the color and the gear itself are
used<00:04:55.919> completely<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:56.669> we're<00:04:56.789> pulling<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.389> all

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
used completely so we're pulling on all

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.020 
used completely so we're pulling on all
threads<00:04:58.349> not<00:04:59.069> to<00:04:59.250> damage<00:04:59.639> them<00:04:59.849> we're

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
threads not to damage them we're

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.480 
threads not to damage them we're
dispersing<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.560> pressure<00:05:01.889> across<00:05:02.190> all

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
dispersing that the pressure across all

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.010 
dispersing that the pressure across all
threads<00:05:02.849> evenly<00:05:03.240> make<00:05:03.449> sure<00:05:03.569> to<00:05:03.629> screw<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:03.960> in

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
threads evenly make sure to screw it in

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.140 
threads evenly make sure to screw it in
all<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.409> way<00:05:06.229> next<00:05:07.229> we're<00:05:07.379> going<00:05:07.469> to<00:05:07.969> turn<00:05:08.969> the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
all the way next we're going to turn the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.700 
all the way next we're going to turn the
bolt<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.659> put<00:05:09.840> pressure<00:05:10.110> on<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:10.440> end<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.620> the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
bolt to put pressure on the end of the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.680 
bolt to put pressure on the end of the
crank<00:05:11.009> against<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.729> crankshaft<00:05:12.120> button

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
crank against that crankshaft button

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.149 
crank against that crankshaft button
which<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.169> very<00:05:13.319> important<00:05:13.770> as<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:13.889> don't<00:05:13.979> want

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
which is very important as we don't want

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:21.860 
which is very important as we don't want
to<00:05:14.219> damage<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.580> crankshaft<00:05:20.479> on<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.629> gear

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
to damage the crankshaft on the gear

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.159 
to damage the crankshaft on the gear
comes<00:05:22.469> off<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.860> end<00:05:22.979> of<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.129> crankshaft<00:05:23.460> and

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
comes off the end of the crankshaft and

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.450 
comes off the end of the crankshaft and
that<00:05:25.169> is<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.379> complete<00:05:25.770> removal<00:05:26.129> of<00:05:26.370> the
