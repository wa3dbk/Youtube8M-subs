 Hello dear friends and welcome 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.570
 to the new review of mods minekravt 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.789
 Today we will see a mod which 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 allow you to grow loot which 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 falls from monsters like this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.600
 but let's go the very beginning and first 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.789
 block you have to craft this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.250
 here with a life style planter crafting 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 he is from bone meal seeds buckets of water and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
 dirt further install it that way 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 so that around it was either grass 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.489
 either the dirt and after a long gap 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.860
 of time, they will turn into such 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 the look of scarlet was worth this kind of light was worth 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 it is impossible not how to craft it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.860
 get only with this process 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.710
 and the process is really debts because 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 these four blocks took me about 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.520
 20 minutes is the grass we have not yet 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.890
 redeveloped so we see that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.079
 have to wait very long but then them 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.789
 you can jump and move for example in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 another place like i did here 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 how can we grow a stalk now 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 First, we need loot which we 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.280
 and we want to grow it in my case 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 will be the bone we approach and pike it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.799
 right click instead of this one 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.020
 brown mixture turns white white 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.030
 spot from which then grows 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 our stem further we take here in such 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 Here is an unusual bob that is crafted from 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.259
 apple bone meal and seed and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.060
 set it here now with 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.310
 the help of bone meal can accelerate growth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.680
 you can just wait but we wait 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.720
 we will and here is such a stalk 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.500
 on which then will be formed 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.360
 women women depend on the loot which 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.909
 you planted before you grow this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.880
 stalk i planted a bone so i have and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.020
 bob grow up with a bone 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 well now let's try 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.329
 smash our women and see what of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.030
 them the first god falls this babes bone 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.890
 and rolls three dice for three let's 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.740
 Immediately all the words they do it quickly 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.469
 and see what attacks us so 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.810
 because the items we drop out 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.659
 we see one to three drops out 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.149
 of items this is somehow random 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.069
 and selected items that are very valuable 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.090
 there is an ender pearl you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.590
 can grow 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 that will help you a lot 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.120
 All this lot I have grown for about 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.800
 20 minutes so every 20 minutes you 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.800
 You can get such valuable ones 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.900
 resources i think is very convenient and mod 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.819
 really good and this is all mod 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.980
 nothing else adds and was with you 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.930
