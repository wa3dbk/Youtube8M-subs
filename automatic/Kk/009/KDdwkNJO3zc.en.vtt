optimized<00:00:18.720> power<00:00:19.020> supply<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:20.100> we've<00:00:20.279> yet

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
optimized power supply that we've yet

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640 
optimized power supply that we've yet
encountered<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> new<00:00:21.869> RM<00:00:22.260> series

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
encountered this is the new RM series

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439 
encountered this is the new RM series
from<00:00:22.890> Corsair<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:24.029> kind<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
from Corsair and it's kind of a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.429 
from Corsair and it's kind of a
replacement<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> TX<00:00:25.949> M<00:00:26.510> v2<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
replacement for the TX M v2 so that is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
replacement for the TX M v2 so that is
their<00:00:28.650> TX<00:00:29.039> modular<00:00:29.699> series<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.420> might

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
their TX modular series so as you might

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.200 
their TX modular series so as you might
expect<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.009> modular<00:00:32.489> power<00:00:32.910> supply

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
expect it is a modular power supply

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
expect it is a modular power supply
which<00:00:33.540> means<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> cables<00:00:34.230> are<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.350> pre

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
which means the cables are not pre

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610 
which means the cables are not pre
attached<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.600> what<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.780> also<00:00:36.989> might<00:00:37.350> not

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
attached and what you also might not

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010 
attached and what you also might not
expect<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.510> Corsair<00:00:39.989> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
expect is that it has what Corsair is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.610 
expect is that it has what Corsair is
calling<00:00:40.500> their<00:00:40.770> hmm<00:00:41.460> 0<00:00:42.149> rpm<00:00:42.809> fan<00:00:43.170> mode<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
calling their hmm 0 rpm fan mode so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
calling their hmm 0 rpm fan mode so
they've<00:00:43.770> brought<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.280> down<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> ax

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
they've brought this down from the ax

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.619 
they've brought this down from the ax
and<00:00:45.629> ax<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.050> Series<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> RM<00:00:47.370> series<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.329> your

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and ax I Series to the RM series so your

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
and ax I Series to the RM series so your
fan<00:00:48.899> actually<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> spin

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
fan actually is not even going to spin

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
fan actually is not even going to spin
up<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.960> until<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> reach<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.190> 40

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
up at all until you reach about 40

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.459 
up at all until you reach about 40
percent<00:00:53.850> load<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.260> typical

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
percent load so this is your typical

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
percent load so this is your typical
power<00:00:55.860> supply<00:00:56.309> fan<00:00:56.550> curve<00:00:56.850> compared<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.780> their

zero<00:00:58.469> rpm<00:00:58.710> fan<00:00:59.219> curve<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
zero rpm fan curve now with all of that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
zero rpm fan curve now with all of that
said<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.100> isn't<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.640> first<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.239> we've

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
said this isn't the first time we've

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
said this isn't the first time we've
ever<00:01:03.600> seen<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.199> feature<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.739> fact<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.220> been

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
ever seen this feature in fact it's been

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160 
ever seen this feature in fact it's been
around<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:06.060> kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> while<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.960> power

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
around for kind of a while the power

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770 
around for kind of a while the power
supply<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.799> system<00:01:08.280> doesn't<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.180> its<00:01:09.540> fan

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
supply in my system doesn't have its fan

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
supply in my system doesn't have its fan
spin<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.260> until<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.549> under<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> fairly

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
spin up until it's under a fairly

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.929 
spin up until it's under a fairly
significant<00:01:13.020> load<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> first<00:01:14.760> time

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
significant load but it's the first time

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.630 
significant load but it's the first time
that<00:01:15.119> we've<00:01:15.570> seen<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> manufacturer<00:01:16.740> optimized

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that we've seen a manufacturer optimized

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.609 
that we've seen a manufacturer optimized
for<00:01:17.880> silence<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.630> way<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> goes<00:01:19.110> beyond

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
for silence in a way that goes beyond

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
for silence in a way that goes beyond
having<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> fan<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:21.030> spin<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.080> we've

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
having the fan not spin so we've

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.260 
having the fan not spin so we've
actually<00:01:22.439> got<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> closed<00:01:23.340> cell<00:01:23.640> foam<00:01:23.670> inside

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
actually got a closed cell foam inside

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
actually got a closed cell foam inside
here<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.750> packaging<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> go

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
here for packaging and we're going to go

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
here for packaging and we're going to go
ahead<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.939> open<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.479> baby<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.290> what

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
ahead and open this baby up so what

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.140 
ahead and open this baby up so what
Corsair<00:01:28.950> has<00:01:28.979> done<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.490> they've<00:01:29.670> optimized

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
Corsair has done is they've optimized

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.560 
Corsair has done is they've optimized
the<00:01:30.390> fan<00:01:30.630> blades<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> 135<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.939> 140

it<00:01:35.009> they're<00:01:35.130> usually<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> same<00:01:35.970> size

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it they're usually around the same size

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.050 
it they're usually around the same size
to<00:01:36.900> reduce<00:01:37.290> turbulence<00:01:37.619> okay<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:38.970> not

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
to reduce turbulence okay so it's not

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.950 
to reduce turbulence okay so it's not
the<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:39.600> we've<00:01:39.750> heard<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the first time we've heard a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
the first time we've heard a
manufacturer<00:01:40.560> say<00:01:40.740> yes<00:01:40.920> optimized<00:01:41.460> fan

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
manufacturer say yes optimized fan

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.630 
manufacturer say yes optimized fan
design<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.450> okay<00:01:42.979> but<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.130> they've<00:01:44.310> really

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
design or okay but what they've really

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
design or okay but what they've really
done<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.479> hand<00:01:46.110> selected<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
done is they have hand selected the

had<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.850> flat<00:03:24.060> cables<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.810> molex<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.620> SATA

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
had the flat cables on molex and SATA

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.600 
had the flat cables on molex and SATA
however<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.770> first<00:03:28.890> time<00:03:29.370> I've

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
however this is the first time I've

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.090 
however this is the first time I've
personally<00:03:30.120> seen<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:31.170> flat<00:03:31.410> cable<00:03:31.650> approach

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
personally seen the flat cable approach

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.410 
personally seen the flat cable approach
taken<00:03:32.580> with<00:03:32.730> 24<00:03:33.510> pin<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:33.959> well<00:03:34.020> as<00:03:34.860> with<00:03:35.280> 6<00:03:35.940> +<00:03:36.150> 2

taken with 24 pin as well as with 6 + 2
C<00:03:36.959> nice<00:03:37.320> flat<00:03:37.890> there's<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.459> 8<00:03:38.610> wires<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
C nice flat there's your 8 wires and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.240 
C nice flat there's your 8 wires and
otherwise<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.020> completely<00:03:40.440> flat<00:03:40.650> as<00:03:40.860> well

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
otherwise it's completely flat as well

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.920 
otherwise it's completely flat as well
as<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> 4<00:03:41.670> +<00:03:41.820> 4<00:03:42.030> pin<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.360> makes<00:03:42.570> cable

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
as the 4 + 4 pin this makes cable

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.960 
as the 4 + 4 pin this makes cable
management<00:03:43.080> easier<00:03:43.770> even<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.760> don't

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
management easier even if you don't

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.610 
management easier even if you don't
happen<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.600> case<00:03:45.959> that's<00:03:46.230> great<00:03:46.440> for

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
happen to have a case that's great for

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.670 
happen to have a case that's great for
cable<00:03:46.920> management<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.730> kudos<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.510> Corsair<00:03:49.170> for

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
cable management so kudos to Corsair for

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.770 
cable management so kudos to Corsair for
thinking<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.760> implementing<00:03:51.660> it

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
thinking of that and implementing it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.050 
thinking of that and implementing it
because<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.620> actually<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.400> easy<00:03:53.640> to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
because it's actually not that easy to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.550 
because it's actually not that easy to
get<00:03:54.150> factories<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.870> things<00:03:55.110> like<00:03:55.320> this

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
get factories to do things like this

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.620 
get factories to do things like this
there's<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.920> lot<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.310> there's<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> lot<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.360> ease

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
there's a lot of there's a lot of ease

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.360 
there's a lot of there's a lot of ease
of<00:03:57.660> assembly<00:03:58.260> stuff<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.890> goes<00:03:59.040> along<00:03:59.190> with

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
of assembly stuff that goes along with

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.340 
of assembly stuff that goes along with
color<00:03:59.730> coding<00:03:59.940> things<00:04:00.330> which<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.989> why<00:04:01.170> they

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
color coding things which is why they

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.870 
color coding things which is why they
like<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.680> color<00:04:01.830> code<00:04:02.130> them<00:04:02.280> at<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.520> factory

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
like to color code them at the factory

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.370 
like to color code them at the factory
and<00:04:02.970> manufacturing<00:04:03.660> level<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.140> there's<00:04:04.320> a

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
sample power supply is the distribution

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.580 
sample power supply is the distribution
of<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.220> rail<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:06.090> single<00:05:06.450> 12<00:05:07.229> volt

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
of the rail so it's a single 12 volt

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.560 
of the rail so it's a single 12 volt
70.8<00:05:08.400> amp<00:05:08.610> rail<00:05:08.850> that<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.060> capable<00:05:09.479> of

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
70.8 amp rail that is capable of

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.260 
70.8 amp rail that is capable of
providing<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.080> entire<00:05:10.440> 850<00:05:11.400> watts<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.880> this

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
providing the entire 850 watts that this

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.450 
providing the entire 850 watts that this
power<00:05:12.479> supply<00:05:12.810> can<00:05:12.870> supply<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:13.830> tells<00:05:14.190> us

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
power supply can supply so that tells us

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.790 
power supply can supply so that tells us
that<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.910> 3.3<00:05:15.540> volt<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.930> 5<00:05:16.169> volt<00:05:16.410> rails<00:05:16.620> are

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
that the 3.3 volt and 5 volt rails are

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.500 
that the 3.3 volt and 5 volt rails are
actually<00:05:17.100> derived<00:05:17.400> from<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.940> 12<00:05:18.150> volt<00:05:18.360> rail

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
actually derived from the 12 volt rail

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.550 
actually derived from the 12 volt rail
this<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:18.840> an<00:05:18.930> approach<00:05:19.200> that<00:05:19.229> we've<00:05:19.530> been

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
this is an approach that we've been

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.770 
this is an approach that we've been
seeing<00:05:19.889> for<00:05:20.460> quite<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.729> while<00:05:20.940> here<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.539> comes

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
seeing for quite a while here it comes

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.240 
seeing for quite a while here it comes
with<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:21.960> five<00:05:22.200> year<00:05:22.229> warranty<00:05:22.440> something<00:05:23.160> I

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
with a five year warranty something I

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.279 
with a five year warranty something I
often<00:05:23.700> forget<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.060> mention<00:05:24.270> in<00:05:24.570> my<00:05:24.600> unboxings

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
often forget to mention in my unboxings

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.590 
often forget to mention in my unboxings
and<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:26.190> think<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.760> pretty<00:05:26.910> much<00:05:27.030> wraps<00:05:27.150> it<00:05:27.479> up

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
and I think that pretty much wraps it up

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.240 
and I think that pretty much wraps it up
