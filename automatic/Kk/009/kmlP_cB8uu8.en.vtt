00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
with the sure as I'm 93 and so that will

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.569 
with the sure as I'm 93 and so that will
be<00:02:18.450> much<00:02:18.870> less<00:02:19.140> noise<00:02:19.409> from<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.860> background<00:02:20.340> I

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
be much less noise from the background I

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.250 
be much less noise from the background I
suppose<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.620> yeah<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.099> how<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.489> sounds

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
suppose and yeah this is how it sounds

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.380 
suppose and yeah this is how it sounds
with<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> little<00:02:25.829> less<00:02:26.340> noise<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
with a little less noise in the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.470 
with a little less noise in the
background<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:29.519> can<00:02:29.700> hear<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.209> have

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
background as you can hear I don't have

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.780 
background as you can hear I don't have
to<00:02:30.569> shout<00:02:30.810> anymore<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.220> noises<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
to shout anymore the noises in the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.899 
to shout anymore the noises in the
background<00:02:32.909> are<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.659> same<00:02:33.870> level<00:02:34.109> though

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
background are the same level though

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.490 
background are the same level though
let's<00:02:35.909> move<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> last<00:02:36.720> spot<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
let's move to the last spot of this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.819 
let's move to the last spot of this
field<00:02:37.769> test<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:39.510> moved<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:39.900> 500<00:02:40.620> meters

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
field test we moved about 500 meters

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.250 
field test we moved about 500 meters
away<00:02:40.950> from<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.370> freeway<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.329> we're<00:02:42.959> still

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
away from the freeway and we're still

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.099 
away from the freeway and we're still
testing<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.980> shirt<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.609> 93<00:02:45.480> microphone

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
testing the shirt as a 93 microphone

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.949 
testing the shirt as a 93 microphone
that<00:02:47.099> is<00:02:47.129> quite<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.879> bit<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> wind<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.599> rustling

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that is quite a bit of wind and rustling

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.500 
that is quite a bit of wind and rustling
leaves<00:02:49.139> but<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.099> think<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.819> microphone

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
leaves but I think this microphone

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.920 
leaves but I think this microphone
actually<00:02:52.079> filters<00:02:52.440> out<00:02:52.530> quite<00:02:52.889> well<00:02:53.599> my<00:02:54.599> voice

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
actually filters out quite well my voice

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.129 
actually filters out quite well my voice
from<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.560> environment<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:57.209> SM<00:02:57.420> 93<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.109> a

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
from the environment the SM 93 is a

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.990 
from the environment the SM 93 is a
great<00:02:58.680> mic<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.099> pick<00:02:59.280> up<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.519> voice<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.849> your

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
great mic to pick up the voice of your

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.629 
great mic to pick up the voice of your
subject<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.139> it<00:03:01.230> performs<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:01.769> well<00:03:02.280> in

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
subject and it performs really well in

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.110 
subject and it performs really well in
outdoor<00:03:02.879> situations<00:03:04.340> but<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.430> also<00:03:05.609> has<00:03:05.939> some

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
outdoor situations but it also has some

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.990 
outdoor situations but it also has some
drawbacks<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.739> Mike<00:03:07.980> cannot<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.489> used<00:03:08.730> to

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
drawbacks this Mike cannot be used to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.050 
drawbacks this Mike cannot be used to
record<00:03:09.420> environmental<00:03:10.260> sounds<00:03:10.700> for<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.849> I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
record environmental sounds for that I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.979 
record environmental sounds for that I
recommend<00:03:12.510> erode<00:03:13.019> stereo<00:03:13.530> videomic<00:03:13.859> pro<00:03:14.989> also

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
recommend erode stereo videomic pro also

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.629 
recommend erode stereo videomic pro also
keep<00:03:16.409> in<00:03:16.530> mind<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.040> need<00:03:17.189> a<00:03:17.220> separate

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
keep in mind that you need a separate

sound recorder when shooting with a DSLR
which<00:03:20.669> also<00:03:21.150> adds<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.569> cost<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.459> finally

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
which also adds to the cost and finally

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.099 
which also adds to the cost and finally
because<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.849> have<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.060> wire<00:03:24.269> up<00:03:24.510> your<00:03:24.629> subject

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
because you have to wire up your subject

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.289 
because you have to wire up your subject
it<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.590> less<00:03:25.859> usable<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.609> running<00:03:27.150> gun
