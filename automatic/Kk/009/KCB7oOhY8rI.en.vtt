00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and stews but basically what you want is

because you won't be taking any damage

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.090 
because you won't be taking any damage
yeah<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> crystal<00:01:03.870> bow<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> drops

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
yeah I use a crystal bow in the drops

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.570 
yeah I use a crystal bow in the drops
even<00:01:05.729> paid<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.020> 900<00:01:07.680> k<00:01:07.860> payment<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.369> made

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
even paid for the 900 k payment I made

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.359 
even paid for the 900 k payment I made
so<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> gets<00:01:10.950> lower

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so and as you know like as it gets lower

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.920 
so and as you know like as it gets lower
and<00:01:11.520> lower<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.119> won't<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> pay<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.900> much

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and lower you won't have to pay as much

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.080 
and lower you won't have to pay as much
for<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.010> crystal<00:01:14.340> though<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.640> it's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
for the crystal though so it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
for the crystal though so it's
definitely<00:01:15.390> worth<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.869> long<00:01:15.930> run<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
definitely worth it in the long run to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
definitely worth it in the long run to
use<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.890> especially<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
use one especially if you have it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
use one especially if you have it
degraded<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.650> 180<00:01:20.159> k<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
degraded all the way to like 180 k to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
degraded all the way to like 180 k to
repair<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:23.030> rune<00:01:24.030> crossbow<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.689> broads

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
repair if not a rune crossbow and broads

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.160 
repair if not a rune crossbow and broads
okay<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.670> 80<00:01:26.939> range<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.570> i<00:01:27.930> would

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
okay if you have say 80 range I i would

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.130 
okay if you have say 80 range I i would
say<00:01:28.470> because<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.850> slow<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.420> i'm<00:01:30.960> at

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
say because it's a little slow at i'm at

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.230 
say because it's a little slow at i'm at
73<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.920> broads<00:01:32.159> yeah<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
73 with broads yeah and it's kind of a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640 
73 with broads yeah and it's kind of a
little<00:01:33.420> slow<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.900> i<00:01:33.990> guess<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> could<00:01:34.409> use

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
little slow but i guess you could use

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.170 
little slow but i guess you could use
like<00:01:34.770> rubies<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.700> case<00:01:35.909> would<00:01:36.119> be

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
like rubies and in that case would be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.380 
like rubies and in that case would be
like<00:01:36.540> pretty<00:01:36.780> fast<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.439> i'm<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.030> go
