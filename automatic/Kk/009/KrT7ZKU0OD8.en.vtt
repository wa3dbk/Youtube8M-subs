00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.420 

this<00:00:48.989> may<00:00:49.170> seem<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> weird<00:00:49.800> time<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> give

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this may seem like a weird time to give

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.170 
this may seem like a weird time to give
a<00:00:50.460> shout<00:00:50.730> out

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it's unusual that the storm would be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.179 
it's unusual that the storm would be
just<00:01:14.760> really<00:01:15.170> compacted<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.290> isolated<00:01:17.009> like

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
just really compacted and isolated like

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.999 
just really compacted and isolated like
that<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> tornado<00:01:19.049> has<00:01:19.380> already<00:01:19.799> touched

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that but a tornado has already touched

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.990 
that but a tornado has already touched
down<00:01:20.509> out<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> half<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.530> hour<00:01:22.619> ago

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
down out of it about a half an hour ago

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.350 
down out of it about a half an hour ago
and<00:01:24.080> anyway<00:01:25.080> I'll<00:01:25.229> keep<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.680> posted<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:27.030> what

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
goes on in in the middle of one of these

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.510 
goes on in in the middle of one of these
