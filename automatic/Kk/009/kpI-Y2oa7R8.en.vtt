 I 'm starting to assemble the prosperous arm It's an advanced ms joint but my arm is 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.939
 It feels like something that is not the same as the previous joint 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.629
 There are joints that the exterior height affects 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.530
 Is wonder if the original issue in Once, however if the 180-degree bend it are 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.640

 Far efficiently rg it because it is north 3 go up quickly assembled to go up to the high accuracy of the split than 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.229
 Thanks to this advanced ms joint, right? 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:40.670
 As for the clothes , the manipulator is remarkable, and three fingers are attached. 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:45.280

 In the back is this I this is why this from the top but it is beam saber sheath Umaｰｰ 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.479
 It is a type of covering 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.560
 Every time I make other things that I am surprised at the fineness, but it is so big 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.520
 Like this 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:22.280

 It 's a sharp part of a cat that is cool 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:58.200
 So if you look at it with a camera but you do n't know how ugly it is, you want it to look real 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.330
 Because it would scattered want this to look real ne real grade

 This is real profile of real grade, isn't it? 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.319
 Certainly master grade is natural in the eye power or something 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:27.099
 Because the scale is large, it is true for high precision 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:32.519
