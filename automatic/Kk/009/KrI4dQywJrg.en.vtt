and then going nowhere and then coming

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.859 
and then going nowhere and then coming
out<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.080> nice<00:01:07.320> case<00:01:08.869> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
out this is actually a very nice case so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
out this is actually a very nice case so
it<00:01:11.180> allows<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:13.080> any<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:13.950> case<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it allows you to as any other case it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.450 
it allows you to as any other case it
allows<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> basically<00:01:16.040> have<00:01:17.040> different

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
allows you to basically have different

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
viewing angles so say i wanted to put it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
viewing angles so say i wanted to put it
in<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> keyboard<00:01:22.890> typing<00:01:23.990> mode<00:01:24.990> i<00:01:25.320> would

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
in like a keyboard typing mode i would

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
in like a keyboard typing mode i would
just<00:01:26.250> take<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.409> little<00:01:28.409> flap<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.280> you

type<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.729> found<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:57.750> useful<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.969> typing

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
type I found this very useful for typing

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.090 
type I found this very useful for typing
although<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.259> type<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
although I'm not much of a type or so I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.490 
although I'm not much of a type or so I
don't<00:02:02.490> use<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:03.170> now<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> other

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
don't use it that much now the other

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.819 
don't use it that much now the other
angle<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> viewing<00:02:05.850> angle<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:07.649> i

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
angle here is a viewing angle so if i

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.220 
angle here is a viewing angle so if i
wanted<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.429> put<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.600 

and<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.530> got<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.680> press<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.280> down<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.430> little

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and you got to press it down a little

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
around it and that is basically at as I

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.060 
around it and that is basically at as I
showed<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.870> guys<00:04:19.079> before<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.799> stuff

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
it's actually a very nice case I think

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.270 
it's actually a very nice case I think
he<00:04:22.169> cost<00:04:22.380> me<00:04:22.469> thirty<00:04:22.800> nine<00:04:22.979> ninety<00:04:23.010> nine<00:04:23.360> from

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
he cost me thirty nine ninety nine from

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.450 
he cost me thirty nine ninety nine from
cyber<00:04:25.550> acoustics<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:27.050> was<00:04:27.170> pretty<00:04:28.160> fast

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
cyber acoustics and it was pretty fast

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.860 
cyber acoustics and it was pretty fast
shift<00:04:28.760> up<00:04:28.910> me<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.120> think<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.360> took<00:04:29.450> three<00:04:29.720> days

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870

feels very very sturdy and strong so I

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.190 
feels very very sturdy and strong so I
give<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.030> like<00:05:23.060> like<00:05:23.389> a<00:05:23.419> five<00:05:23.720> star<00:05:24.020> or

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
give it like like a five star or

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.870 
give it like like a five star or
something<00:05:24.350> because<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:25.010> really<00:05:25.280> is<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.610> good

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
something because it really is a good

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.560 
something because it really is a good
case<00:05:26.150> for<00:05:26.180> $39<00:05:27.169> I<00:05:27.320> i<00:05:27.350> bought<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.280> Smart<00:05:29.150> Cover

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
case for $39 I i bought the Smart Cover

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.240 
case for $39 I i bought the Smart Cover
for<00:05:29.990> thirty-nine<00:05:30.560> dollars<00:05:30.710> i<00:05:31.040> ended<00:05:31.220> up

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
for thirty-nine dollars i ended up

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.530 
for thirty-nine dollars i ended up
returning<00:05:31.610> because<00:05:31.850> it<00:05:32.030> didn't<00:05:32.240> cover<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
returning because it didn't cover the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.320 
returning because it didn't cover the
back<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:33.590> i<00:05:34.010> think<00:05:34.669> this<00:05:34.910> was<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.090> better

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
back so i think this was a better

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.190 
back so i think this was a better
investment<00:05:35.780> quite<00:05:36.560> honestly<00:05:36.880> but<00:05:37.880> i<00:05:38.150> hope<00:05:39.110> you

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200
