00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.400
 thursday 26 february you know that the football ajax comes against fiorentina 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.449
 all to the arena what appears you need support for tickets 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.289
 go to the pint again ajax.nl nasa has no good advice I know 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.289
 no more roj 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.339
 in the first half in Tunisia 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.749
 year was great fun to experience 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.230
 and even then for the first time 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.090
 yes i live part international one 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.170
 yes I have played that few people but 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.330
 am happy to have played the pole for a reason 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.370
 she was also employed in emmen getting the big orange 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.000
 on behalf of the legs of my start cooking and then two boys with ajax 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.490
 year permanent contract 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.750
 but that was a very nice experience beautiful to experience 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.810
 next to his heart and his car what do you think of it 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.559
 we are very eager of course could 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.980
 to win that match and must also simply win 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.440
 not everyone is looking forward to it 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.840
 well i don't put ajax in all pechstein follows at a point that his heart works 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.380
 neither is this the chance to regain some confidence there 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.040
 yes I think that kemper 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.520
 they set this well the valve 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.320
 Trust is back and that the rest of Sudan can do that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.170
 and will not have won the last four games 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.120
 so you do something 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.460
 that is palpable within all levels that is clear 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.230
 we also have 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.810
 be at the top 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.640
 people talked 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.040
 because he is not sufficiently confident 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.890
 and otherwise not 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.580
 and that is not true 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.760
 nice and good 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.410
 does not take that away 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.340
 the confidence of being translated into a good one 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.980
 results and good competitions 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.350
 because of course it is pure in this phase 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.140
 as the Netherlands the World Cup many boys said Pechtold 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.740
 then you can prepare well 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.090
 after half past nine 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.410
 it is a bit difficult because it is not its 6 11 7 so 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 difficult because I play eleven against eleven but 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.769
 maybe it's good too 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.729
 but to have such a quiet week 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.849
 and that might be fine 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.949
 a bit of rest 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.099
 to get 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.099
 of course hectic week has been like that again 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.099
 maybe it's good there must be a sunday 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.659
 have come true it is a different competition period 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.729
 does it matter 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.109
 and no I don't think so 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.699
 at ajax but she is always taking the country match, I think 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.959
 yes both of them are not doing their best I think 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.859
 but we have to be a bit naughty now 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.949
 I can imagine that you are all very keen on the CDA group 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.959
 yes certainly not 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.039
 yes we just want 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.129
 a bit to the line in the negative responses 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 now we have to sit in one 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.629
 continue the line 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.229
 and refine I don't need an extra incentive 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.799
 no I don't think so I think everyone will 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.799
 more than one hundred percent motivated is test driver 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:21.919
 yes i'm sure
