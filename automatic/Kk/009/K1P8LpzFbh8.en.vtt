00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
our point we're going to start off with

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.600 
our point we're going to start off with
the<00:00:33.149> white<00:00:33.480> gold<00:00:33.719> ring<00:00:33.950> it's<00:00:34.950> still<00:00:35.340> in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the white gold ring it's still in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.639 
the white gold ring it's still in
brand-new<00:00:36.030> condition<00:00:36.270> still<00:00:37.050> circular<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
brand-new condition still circular and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.549 
brand-new condition still circular and
we're<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> hit<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> hammer

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
we're going to hit it with a hammer

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:50.660 
we're going to hit it with a hammer
multiple<00:00:40.559> times<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.340> happens

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:02.619 

you

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.660 

so<00:01:03.629> either<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.500> move<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> tungsten

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so either we move on to the tungsten

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
so either we move on to the tungsten
ring<00:01:06.000> itself<00:01:06.290> I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.590> ahead<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
ring itself I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.850 
ring itself I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.369> inside<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:10.729> vise<00:01:11.729> grip<00:01:11.970> pliers<00:01:12.860> give

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
put it inside the vise grip pliers give

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.990 
put it inside the vise grip pliers give
you<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> few<00:01:14.130> whacks<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.550> hammer<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.820> see

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you a few whacks with a hammer and see

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.300 
you a few whacks with a hammer and see
what<00:01:15.119> happens

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.679 

here<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:31.400> have<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.580> white<00:01:31.729> gold<00:01:31.909> ring<00:01:32.090> as<00:01:32.240> you

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
here we have the white gold ring as you

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.060 
here we have the white gold ring as you
can<00:01:32.810> see<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.080> didn't<00:01:33.290> do<00:01:33.380> too<00:01:33.560> well<00:01:33.590> on<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
can see it didn't do too well on the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.760 
can see it didn't do too well on the
hammer<00:01:34.490> test<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.840> softest<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.560> three

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
hammer test the softest of the three

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.320 
hammer test the softest of the three
metals<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.189> we<00:01:37.310> use<00:01:37.490> today<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.909> can<00:01:38.180> see

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
metals that we use today you can see

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.719 
metals that we use today you can see
that<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:38.689> obviously<00:01:39.140> warped<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.830> believe

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
that it's obviously warped and believe

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.800 
that it's obviously warped and believe
we<00:01:40.880> only<00:01:41.030> hit<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.740> three<00:01:42.740> or<00:01:42.770> four<00:01:42.920> times<00:01:43.810> next

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
we only hit it three or four times next

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.380 
we only hit it three or four times next
we<00:01:44.930> have<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.229> titanium<00:01:45.590> ring<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.149> little

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
we have the titanium ring it's a little

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.510 
we have the titanium ring it's a little
bit<00:01:47.509> harder<00:01:47.840> than<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.259> goal<00:01:48.440> itself<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.250> as

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
bit harder than the goal itself but as

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.219 
bit harder than the goal itself but as
you<00:01:49.640> can<00:01:49.789> see<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.149> still<00:01:50.450> did<00:01:50.630> not<00:01:50.659> fare<00:01:50.990> too

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
you can see it still did not fare too

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.830 
you can see it still did not fare too
well<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:52.610> moving<00:01:52.880> along<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.390> can<00:01:53.420> see<00:01:53.720> that

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
well and moving along we can see that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.359 
well and moving along we can see that
the<00:01:53.990> tungsten<00:01:54.229> carbide<00:01:54.619> ring<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.130> still

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
the tungsten carbide ring is still

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.580 
the tungsten carbide ring is still
intact<00:01:56.049> still<00:01:57.049> looking<00:01:57.850> perfect<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.590> it's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.830 
intact still looking perfect and it's
ready<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.039> worn<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:02.420> further<00:02:02.659> illustrate

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
the difference between the metals I'll

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.880 
the difference between the metals I'll
