of the pictures and there's a hell of a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
of the pictures and there's a hell of a
lot<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> scoring<00:02:06.500> there's<00:02:07.500> also<00:02:07.679> that<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.280> you

lot of scoring there's also that if you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.369 
lot of scoring there's also that if you
do<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> hair<00:02:08.789> transplant<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.170> hair

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
follicles can do in time and then the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.390 
follicles can do in time and then the
dip<00:02:12.810> or<00:02:13.019> wherever<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.500> transplants<00:02:14.099> are<00:02:14.220> you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
dip or wherever the transplants are you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.460

too much of a sudden change so some for

too much of a sudden change so some for
me<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:40.049> gay<00:02:40.349> man<00:02:40.380> again<00:02:40.920> what<00:02:41.280> really

me and as a gay man again what really

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.960 
me and as a gay man again what really
works<00:02:41.940> out<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.690> know<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:43.340> proceed<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.489> very<00:02:44.700> loud

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
works out I know we proceed is very loud

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.270 
works out I know we proceed is very loud
but<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.900> really<00:02:46.049> works<00:02:46.349> at<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.769> spin<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.099> very

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
but what really works at is spin is very

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.380 
but what really works at is spin is very
subtle<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.200> tattooing<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.519> short<00:02:51.030> crop

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
subtle and tattooing a very short crop

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.930 
subtle and tattooing a very short crop
is<00:02:52.290> very<00:02:52.560> subtle<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.430> great<00:02:53.670> thing<00:02:53.700> about

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
is very subtle and the great thing about

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.729 
is very subtle and the great thing about
it<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.989> want<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> change<00:02:55.500> it

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
it is is that if you want to change it

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.490 
it is is that if you want to change it
or<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.099> want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> top<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.870> process<00:02:58.110> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
or you want to top it up the process is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.589 
or you want to top it up the process is
that<00:02:58.530> difficult<00:02:58.890> whereas<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> transplant<00:03:00.390> is

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
that difficult whereas the transplant is

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.360 
that difficult whereas the transplant is
more<00:03:00.840> scarring<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.650> more<00:03:01.860> cutting<00:03:02.190> up

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
more scarring it's more cutting up

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.520 
more scarring it's more cutting up
smashing<00:03:02.790> hair<00:03:03.239> point<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.989> much<00:03:04.290> more

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
smashing hair point it's much more

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.789 
smashing hair point it's much more
surgery<00:03:05.389> is<00:03:06.389> it's<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> unknown<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.620> course

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
surgery is it's the unknown so of course

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.170 
surgery is it's the unknown so of course
I'm<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.549> know<00:03:08.790> isn't<00:03:09.030> going

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
I'm going to have you know isn't going

like a plum there's always those kind of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.910 
like a plum there's always those kind of
questions<00:03:12.799> but<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.859> tend<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.700> generally

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
questions but I tend to generally

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.349 
questions but I tend to generally
research<00:03:16.920> anything<00:03:17.310> i'm<00:03:17.670> going<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.880> commit<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
to get to with my I'm thinking of just

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.629 
to get to with my I'm thinking of just
getting<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.840> kind<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.769> cut<00:03:35.099> there<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
getting it a kind of cut there and

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.000 
getting it a kind of cut there and
having<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.660> bit<00:03:36.840> more<00:03:36.959> tapered<00:03:37.319> because<00:03:37.980> I

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
having it a bit more tapered because I

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.920 
having it a bit more tapered because I
think<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.549> is<00:03:38.639> going<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.910> be<00:03:38.970> too<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:39.599> too

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
think it is going to be too like too

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.410 
think it is going to be too like too
rigid<00:03:40.290> it's<00:03:40.889> going<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.250> catch<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.849> eye<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.269> is

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
rigid it's going to catch the eye it is

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.270 
rigid it's going to catch the eye it is
slightly<00:03:42.720> more<00:03:42.870> tapered<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.099> bit

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
slightly more tapered and you it's a bit

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.670 
slightly more tapered and you it's a bit
rough<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.910> cuts<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:46.260> just<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.530> kind

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680
