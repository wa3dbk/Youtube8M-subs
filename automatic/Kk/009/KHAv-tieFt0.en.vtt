this but these are the best ways to make

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
this but these are the best ways to make
sure<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.930> does<00:00:34.110> happen<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.770> game<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.610> the

middle go right at that hoop you can't
do<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> from<00:01:43.740> different<00:01:43.890> angles<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
do it from different angles but that is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.780 
do it from different angles but that is
what<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> found<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> best<00:01:45.869> way<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
what I found is the best way to do it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and once you have that down you're to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.789 
and once you have that down you're to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hold the bat on the right stick but you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380

have<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> hold<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> certain<00:01:54.180> point

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have to hold it back at a certain point

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
have to hold it back at a certain point
which<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> step<00:01:55.020> four<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.549> sure
