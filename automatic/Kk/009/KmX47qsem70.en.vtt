 finish a drop of your own blood 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.180
 if you're playing with several people 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.130
 they will need the same materials for 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.910
 separated and will have to perform the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.520
 steps to follow step number 1 write your 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.540

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.480

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.490
 also on the piece of paper with 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.890
 minus a drop of blood on the paper and 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.370
 allows paper to absorb blood 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.370
 step number 2 turn off all the lights 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.170
 while you perform the ritual go towards 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.540
 some wooden door and place the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.180
 piece of paper with your name and blood 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.640
 in front of the door now take the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.750
 candle light it and place it on top of the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 paper step number 3 hits the door 22 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.990
 Sometimes the time must be midnight 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.540
 end of the last stroke then opens the 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.690
 door blows the candle and closes the door 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.640
 suddenly at that precise moment 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.840
 you will have allowed entry to your home 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.160
 the midnight man step number 4 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.770
 after blowing the candle 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.720
 turn on the immediately it 's 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.600
 It is imperative that you turn it on after 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.390
 having paid for it here is when the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.120
 game starts now you must haunt your 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.489
 completely dark house with candle 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.890
 lit in your hand your goal is to avoid 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.930
 to midnight man at all costs 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.140
 or at least until it's 3 o'clock 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.510
 33 in the morning if your candle is coming 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.510
 to turn that off means that the man of 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.859
 midnight is near you must you 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.069
 relight the candle in the 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.750
 next 10 seconds if you did not succeed 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.969
 when relight the candle and 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.670
 You must immediately create a circle 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:10.189
 of salt on the ground in the event that it does not 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.079
 accomplish is to perform the two actions on 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.329
 midnight man will create a 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.060
 hallucination of your greatest fear and you 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.489
 will pull the guts one by one 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.439
 you will feel it and you will not be able to 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.780
 react to the pain so great that 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.120
 you will feel if you came to do the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.030
 salt circle you must stay there 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.370
 until 333 am not 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.530
 I highly recommend the salt circle and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.169
 that will create your worst fear and will try 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.810
 get out of the circle but believe me it's not going to 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.489
 to attack while you're on it if 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.280
 you managed to relight the candle 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.859
 you can continue with the game you should 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.230
 continue until it is 3 33 of the 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.049
 early morning without being attacked by man 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.240
 from midnight if you were not attacked 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.970
 for him you will have won the game 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.910
 the man will leave your house and you will be 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.340
 except to be able to continue with your day 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.440
 advice if the midnight man 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.560
 is near you will feel that the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.420
 suddenly low temperature 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.180
 you will see a black humanoid 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.580
 through the immense darkness or if 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.459
 you hear a soft whisper coming from 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.870
 any corner where you are 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.760
 means that the midnight man 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.700
 It's close and you should immediately 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.290
 get away from that place do not try to light 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.290
 the lights during the game of the 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.270
 midnight the only thing it would cause is 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.850
 that the lights are broken and the man 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.460
 will kill him do not use a flashlight in the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.800
 midnight game man is not 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.230
 fool if he occupies a flashlight is going to 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.060
 end by shutting down and then you will see the 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.850
 true form of man and will be the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.430
 last thing you see do not fall asleep during 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.590
 the game of midnight in the case 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.290
 end of you getting to sleep 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.780
 Believe me, take it for granted that he is not going to 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.880
 go back to dawn do not try to use the 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.330
 blood of another person with your name on 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.689
 the paper if it comes to perform this trap 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.580
 to happen absolutely nothing at least not 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.460
 I have known of a case that the man of 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.250
 midnight I killed them both not use a 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.949
 lighter as a substitute for the candle 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.379
 will work the candle is necessary to 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.419
 this game if you were to use a 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.699
 lighter as a light source instead 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.669
 of the candle can leave saying goodbye 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.439
 this place and it definitely does not provoke 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.020
 to the midnight man of some 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.629
 way even when the game is over 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.050
 he will always be watching you 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.050
 luck
