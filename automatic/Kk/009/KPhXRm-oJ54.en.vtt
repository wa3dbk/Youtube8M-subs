 red pepper cut large already

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.320
 two teeth play to taste the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 consumer this vegetable base 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 while they are taking coloring 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 while they are finishing a little 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.870
 they will receive the squids but in 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.680
 this case already cuts said as thanks to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.810
 my life as if it were what it would be 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.950
 the magazines understand what you're putting 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.420
 there squid and we are jumping 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.180
 quickly with the vegetables we had 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.950
 seen we hold them the squid has 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.920
 two ideal moments in terms of their 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 cooking point to one is a few 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.410
 minutes of contact with the heat and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.180
 other then from the three 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.030
 minutes and it starts to harden 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.770
 harden and you're going to need at least 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.950
 20 minutes to soften again 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.970
 that always depending on the type of 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.789
 squid that is moving some rings 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.230
 ie very chiquititas is a 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.650
 squid that is not very big then 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.560
 this squid cited that it will be much more 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.200
 quickie we are going to draw 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 squid these cut through 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.760
 be what the abbot would be but without 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.160
 closed with the onion we put 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.030
 green onion also come this 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.690
 the pasta that you take is very fast 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.490
 of water al dente and you put it there for 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.580
 that take the taste of vegetables look 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.820
 How fast is the bottle of oil 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.780
 olive because this is such a paste 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.420
 that olive oil is short 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.630
 onion the squids fast how much 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.790
 you can delay live and how much 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.130
 it took 23 minutes nothing more than that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.650
 obviously you started a pasta that already 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.720
 it is possible 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.260
 that consists of cooking tea with 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.180
 well before al dente and for that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.450
 you put a saucepan with boiling water 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.120
 salted and you remove the pasta pack and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.310
 you get it and cooked it and try and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.859
 when it is well durita that pasta the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.930
 queues and you pass cold water to 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.739
 that to be cut cooking 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.790
 up to one week or one day less in the 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.260
 refrigerator you have those videos al dente 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.819

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.190

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 we did in a few good minutes while 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.780
 we are implanting this delight of these 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.189
