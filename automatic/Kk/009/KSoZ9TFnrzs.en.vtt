not do that and let's just hit play at
this<00:03:09.040> point<00:03:09.370> all<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.849> files<00:03:10.239> are<00:03:10.569> forming

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
this point all the files are forming

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.830 
this point all the files are forming
inside<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.099> folder<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:13.329> doc<00:03:13.480> minecraft

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
inside the folder the doc minecraft

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.780 
inside the folder the doc minecraft
folder<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.680> might<00:03:14.859> take<00:03:14.889> a<00:03:15.099> while<00:03:15.250> because

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
folder so it might take a while because

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.759 
folder so it might take a while because
they<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.180> actually<00:03:16.389> downloading<00:03:17.200> from<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
they are actually downloading from the

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.099 
they are actually downloading from the
side<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.949> depending<00:03:20.949> on<00:03:21.129> your<00:03:21.489> computer<00:03:22.209> speed

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
side so depending on your computer speed

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.180 
side so depending on your computer speed
this<00:03:23.919> might<00:03:24.129> take<00:03:24.459> from<00:03:25.419> 30<00:03:26.169> seconds<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.650> up<00:03:27.129> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
this might take from 30 seconds to up to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.000 
this might take from 30 seconds to up to
like<00:03:27.549> five<00:03:28.000> minutes<00:03:28.379> don't<00:03:29.379> worry<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:29.859> it's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
like five minutes don't worry if it's

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.619 
like five minutes don't worry if it's
taking<00:03:30.340> too<00:03:30.459> long<00:03:30.489> if<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.989> download<00:03:32.769> progress

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
taking too long if the download progress

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.330 
taking too long if the download progress
comes<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.989> end<00:03:35.169> and<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.829> game<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.160> still
