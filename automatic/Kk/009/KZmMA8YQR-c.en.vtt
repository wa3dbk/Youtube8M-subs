critical those guys have done a great

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
critical those guys have done a great
job<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.890> state<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.700> certainly<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.960> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
job in state and certainly we all we all

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
help and contribute with that so I think

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
help and contribute with that so I think
the<00:01:36.210> in-state<00:01:36.570> recruiting<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.470> hugely

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the in-state recruiting is hugely

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.499 
the in-state recruiting is hugely
important<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.640> us<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.060> overall<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
important for us but I think overall is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.560 
important for us but I think overall is
a<00:01:39.600> class<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.579> fill<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
a class you know we fill this just a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200 
a class you know we fill this just a
great<00:01:42.750> class<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.409> covers<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> different

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
great class it covers a lot of different

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
great class it covers a lot of different
positions<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.590> won't<00:01:46.770> hit<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.040> numbers<00:01:47.399> at

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
positions you won't hit your numbers at

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
positions you won't hit your numbers at
different<00:01:47.759> positions<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.479> talked<00:01:48.689> about

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

earlier<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> most<00:01:50.430> part<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
earlier and I think for the most part it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120 
earlier and I think for the most part it

the University of Missouri so in a very

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.179
