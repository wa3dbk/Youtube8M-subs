thought<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:07.170> clever<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
thought it was very clever actually it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.009 
thought it was very clever actually it
has<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> funny<00:02:09.030> ending

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
has a funny ending

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.699 
has a funny ending
I<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:11.280> can't<00:02:11.700> pick<00:02:12.420> apart<00:02:12.900> anything<00:02:13.260> too

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
