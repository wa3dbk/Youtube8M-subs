00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
 Hi this is Colin from GIGABYTE 

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.016
 With the new launch of our new Z68 motherboards 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.020
 We have a new technology called the Intel Smart Response technology 

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:20.500
 What is this really? 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.968
 It allows people to use a lower capacity SSD as a traditional hard drive 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.095
 In order to get a complete system performance 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.043
 As if they use a higher capacity SSD 

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:34.044
 For this I have a new system 

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:36.691
 I just built 

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:37.950
 And I have two hard drives in front of me 

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.700
 The first is an Intel Larson Creek 20GB SSD 

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.934
 And I also have a traditional hard drive 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 What I now want to show is the actual installation of the Intel Smart Response Technology 

00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:54.500
 But as you can see it requires many different steps 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
 And it is a complicated process for most users 

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.578
 For this I have our new GIGABYTE Touch Bios 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 This is our newest program that allows users to make changes to the Windows OS BIOS 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 As you can see here, the system is set up in IDE mode 

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:12.589
 What I'm going to do is get out of here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.457
 I will now try to install the Intel Smart Response Technology 

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:19.137
 As you can see the application started it 

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.400
 But as you can see: "This computer does not meet the minimum requirements" 

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:26.900
 Now that comes as I said because this system is in IDE mode 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 What we need to do now is change this to RAID mode 

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.256
 But as everyone of you knows, who has previously installed RAID 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 You must fully reinstall the operating system to use this new feature 

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:43.270
 Of course this will take you a long time to install the Intel Smart Response technology 

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:45.960
 So what GIGABYTE has done is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.350
 We have created a new utility that actually enables you to set up your system in RAID mode 

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.980
 As well as the automatic installation of Intel Smart Response Technology 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.930
 Simply by clicking on the tool here 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.050
 So now I am going to install this new technology 

00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:04.010
 The system goes through a number of re-boots 

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:09.360
 So the first re-boot goes to the Bios and sets the system in RAID mode 

00:02:10.843 --> 00:02:13.840
 Will restart and install Intel Smart Response Technology 

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:17.770
 So I'm going to do this quickly now and show the process 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.930
 But of course this takes a little time 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.570
 So we're going to speed this up a little bit 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.690
 So as you can see here 

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:29.900
 "The system will be set in RAID mode and will restart the system when it is ready." 

00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:32.940
 So all you have to do is click Continue 

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:10.530
 So there you have it 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.220
 It is now going through the re-boot process 

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.500
 And has now automatically installed Intel Rapid Storage Technology 

00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:17.750
 This now includes Intel Smart Response 

00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:23.790
 As you can see here, the Intel Smart Technology is now set 

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:26.480
 So there you have it 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.500
 GIGABYTE's new Easy Smart Response Technology utility 

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:33.800
 Allows users to quickly set up Intel Smart Response Technology 

00:03:34.668 --> 00:03:37.200
 Without having to reinstall the operating system 

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.900
 So this saves users a lot of time and hassle 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.360
 By setting up their system
