another Games Workshop board set for
customer<00:00:28.760> in<00:00:29.450> the<00:00:29.510> ash<00:00:29.779> waste<00:00:30.080> scheme<00:00:30.800> that<00:00:30.980> I

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
customer in the ash waste scheme that I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.589 
customer in the ash waste scheme that I
did<00:00:31.369> previously<00:00:31.760> so<00:00:32.119> I'm<00:00:32.210> not<00:00:32.270> going<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.449> show

did previously so I'm not going to show
you<00:00:32.690> the<00:00:32.809> entire<00:00:32.930> set<00:00:33.470> you<00:00:33.650> can<00:00:33.770> take<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.280> look

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
you the entire set you can take a look

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.729 
you the entire set you can take a look
at<00:00:34.610> a<00:00:34.670> previous<00:00:34.850> videos<00:00:35.330> to<00:00:36.320> show<00:00:36.470> what<00:00:36.620> that

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
at a previous videos to show what that

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.930 
at a previous videos to show what that
color<00:00:36.949> scheme<00:00:37.190> looks<00:00:37.309> like<00:00:37.550> but<00:00:37.730> he<00:00:37.820> also

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
color scheme looks like but he also

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.930 
color scheme looks like but he also
included<00:00:38.449> two<00:00:38.900> sets<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.680> games<00:00:40.610> workshop

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
included two sets of the games workshop

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.299 
included two sets of the games workshop
craters<00:00:41.330> that<00:00:41.780> he<00:00:41.870> wanted<00:00:42.140> me<00:00:42.290> to<00:00:42.320> paint<00:00:42.650> in<00:00:42.890> a

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
craters that he wanted me to paint in a

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.549 
craters that he wanted me to paint in a
matching<00:00:43.760> color<00:00:44.000> scheme<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.410> just

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
matching color scheme and so I just

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:46.869 
matching color scheme and so I just
wanted<00:00:45.769> to<00:00:45.860> give<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.100> quick<00:00:46.370> peek<00:00:46.610> at<00:00:46.790> how

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
wanted to give you a quick peek at how

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.600 
wanted to give you a quick peek at how
those<00:00:47.090> came<00:00:47.390> out<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.950> for<00:00:49.280> those<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.430> you

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
those came out and and for those of you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.780 
those came out and and for those of you
maybe<00:00:49.820> haven't<00:00:50.120> seen<00:00:50.450> them<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:51.500> person<00:00:52.399> give

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
maybe haven't seen them in person give

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.280 
maybe haven't seen them in person give
you<00:00:52.850> a<00:00:52.910> little<00:00:53.059> sense<00:00:53.270> of<00:00:53.480> their<00:00:53.660> size

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
you a little sense of their size

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.910 
you a little sense of their size
comparison<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.130> know<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.730> miniatures

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
comparison you know to the miniatures

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.100 
comparison you know to the miniatures
yeah<00:00:57.920> sense<00:00:58.190> what<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:58.550> looks<00:00:58.760> like<00:00:58.880> there<00:00:59.270> I

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
yeah sense what that looks like there I

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.959 
yeah sense what that looks like there I
was<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> little<00:01:00.710> bit<00:01:00.800> concerned<00:01:01.250> about<00:01:01.520> how<00:01:01.730> it

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
was a little bit concerned about how it

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.740 
was a little bit concerned about how it
might<00:01:02.059> look<00:01:02.239> with<00:01:03.110> having<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:05.420> know<00:01:05.509> some<00:01:05.720> of

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
might look with having you know some of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.020 
might look with having you know some of
the<00:01:05.869> patchwork<00:01:06.110> that's<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:07.039> the<00:01:07.340> board<00:01:07.580> and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
the patchwork that's on the board and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.820 
the patchwork that's on the board and
with<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.720> know<00:01:08.810> sort<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.259> create<00:01:09.530> sharp

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
with that you know sort of create sharp

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.070 
with that you know sort of create sharp
edges<00:01:10.070> when<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:10.520> lay<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.820> craters<00:01:11.180> down<00:01:11.420> but

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
edges when you lay the craters down but

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.480 
edges when you lay the craters down but
what<00:01:12.259> I<00:01:12.289> did<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.680> carried<00:01:13.039> some<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.340> that

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
what I did is I carried some of that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.120 
what I did is I carried some of that
coloring<00:01:13.910> on<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.600> craters<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.320> couple

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
coloring on to the craters in the couple

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.609 
coloring on to the craters in the couple
patches<00:01:16.340> on<00:01:16.729> every<00:01:16.970> crater<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.470> can

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
patches on every crater here and you can

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.190 
patches on every crater here and you can
see<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.160> know<00:01:19.300> out<00:01:20.300> towards<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.720> edge<00:01:20.869> there

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
see you know out towards the edge there

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.160 
see you know out towards the edge there
and<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:22.520> really<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.360> know<00:01:23.450> too<00:01:23.840> much<00:01:23.990> no

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
and that really you know too much no

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.440 
and that really you know too much no
matter<00:01:24.289> how<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.590> laying<00:01:24.950> down<00:01:25.270> they<00:01:26.270> pretty

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
matter how you laying down they pretty

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.710 
matter how you laying down they pretty
much<00:01:26.709> feel<00:01:27.709> like<00:01:28.039> they<00:01:28.580> match<00:01:28.789> up<00:01:28.819> well<00:01:29.690> with

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
much feel like they match up well with

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.690 
much feel like they match up well with
the<00:01:30.050> board<00:01:30.259> colors<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.340> feels<00:01:31.520> like<00:01:31.670> a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the board colors and it feels like a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.699 
the board colors and it feels like a
pretty<00:01:31.940> natural<00:01:32.149> transition<00:01:32.539> so<00:01:33.050> overall

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
pretty natural transition so overall

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.230 
pretty natural transition so overall
it's<00:01:34.160> pretty<00:01:34.250> happy<00:01:34.670> with<00:01:34.759> how<00:01:34.819> they<00:01:35.030> came<00:01:35.179> out

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's pretty happy with how they came out

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.210 
it's pretty happy with how they came out
and<00:01:35.599> the<00:01:36.259> other<00:01:36.410> thing<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.709> was<00:01:36.860> concerned

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
and the other thing I was concerned

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.650 
and the other thing I was concerned
about<00:01:37.369> was<00:01:37.520> how<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.789> finish<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.209> interiors

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
about was how to finish the interiors

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.260 
about was how to finish the interiors
and<00:01:39.110> whether<00:01:39.319> i<00:01:39.410> should<00:01:39.500> go<00:01:39.649> really<00:01:40.009> dark<00:01:40.369> like

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
and whether i should go really dark like

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.630 
and whether i should go really dark like
a<00:01:41.300> city<00:01:41.950> blackened<00:01:42.950> waste<00:01:43.160> or<00:01:43.399> whether<00:01:43.550> i

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
a city blackened waste or whether i

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.820 
a city blackened waste or whether i
should<00:01:43.789> leave<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.270> as<00:01:44.420> though<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> same

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
should leave it as though it's the same

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.580 
should leave it as though it's the same
colors<00:01:46.160> is<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.300> surrounding<00:01:47.780> material<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.500> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
colors is the surrounding material and I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.870 
colors is the surrounding material and I
really<00:01:48.830> did<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.039> kind<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.369> ended<00:01:49.580> up<00:01:49.670> with<00:01:49.849> a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
really did is kind of ended up with a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.910 
really did is kind of ended up with a
bit<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.209> a<00:01:50.270> compromise<00:01:50.569> where<00:01:51.349> I<00:01:51.380> did<00:01:51.530> black<00:01:51.740> in

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
bit of a compromise where I did black in

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.040 
bit of a compromise where I did black in
the<00:01:52.009> center<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> little<00:01:52.610> bit<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.240> brushed<00:01:53.869> out

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
the center a little bit and brushed out

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.070 
the center a little bit and brushed out
to<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.259> sides<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.310> really<00:01:55.490> gave<00:01:55.759> this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
to the sides and it really gave this

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.990 
to the sides and it really gave this
nice<00:01:57.080> see<00:01:57.709> if<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.920> can<00:01:58.130> get<00:01:58.310> close<00:01:58.550> enough<00:01:58.580> are

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
nice see if I can get close enough are

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.460 
nice see if I can get close enough are
nice<00:01:59.209> crack<00:01:59.810> lecture<00:02:01.179> look<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:02.450> picked<00:02:03.229> up<00:02:03.380> a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
nice crack lecture look it picked up a
