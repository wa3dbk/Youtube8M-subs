00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.820
 The draw took about three weeks and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.490
 couple you already bring it to the end today 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.769
 March 8 is already twenty hours on the clock 19 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.750
 minutes I think everyone was already waiting for me like 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.000
 I can quickly now want this video 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.949

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.949

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.890

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 81 people 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.079
 but again here are the guys I already 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.640

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.090
 this is not a link the link has the form to everyone 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.340

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.689
 person 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.610
 and we in my opinion with the second will give in the second 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.490
 line start so here we write 2 by 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.329

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.579

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.400

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.639
 forged before the start blocked sorry 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.660
