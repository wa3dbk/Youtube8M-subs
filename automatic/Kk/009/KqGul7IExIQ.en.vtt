headphone<00:03:20.670> jack<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.420> general<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:22.260> find<00:03:22.530> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
headphone jack in general I find that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.320 
headphone jack in general I find that
most<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.070> these<00:03:23.190> settings<00:03:23.520> don't<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:24.210> do

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
most of these settings don't really do

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.540 
most of these settings don't really do
any<00:03:24.480> good<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:25.080> do<00:03:25.440> something<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> audio

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
any good they do something to the audio

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.740 
any good they do something to the audio
but<00:03:26.760> they<00:03:26.850> don't<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.090> good<00:03:27.300> things<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
but they don't do good things to the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.660 
but they don't do good things to the
audio<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.260> suppose<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.010> depends<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.430> what

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
audio I suppose it depends on what

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.430 
audio I suppose it depends on what
you're<00:03:29.790> listening<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.450> through<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:30.990> if

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
you're listening to it through so if

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.930 
you're listening to it through so if
you've<00:03:31.740> got<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.190> these<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.580> ahead<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
you've got one of these go ahead and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.370 
you've got one of these go ahead and
give<00:03:33.090> each<00:03:33.210> one<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> shot<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.960> might<00:03:34.140> as<00:03:34.230> well

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
give each one a shot you might as well

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.930 
give each one a shot you might as well
try<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.710> if<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.100> don't<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.520> just<00:03:35.640> turn<00:03:35.820> it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
try it if you don't like it just turn it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.510 
try it if you don't like it just turn it

other music applications you're going to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
other music applications you're going to
find<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.010> they<00:03:41.640> have<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.970> built-in<00:03:42.420> equalizer

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.080 
find that they have a built-in equalizer
already<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:43.950> might<00:03:44.250> find<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.880> that

different fingerprints in here you can

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.279 
different fingerprints in here you can
put<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.240> whole<00:05:27.419> bunch<00:05:27.449> you<00:05:27.810> could<00:05:27.960> put<00:05:28.080> one

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
put a whole bunch you could put one

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.110 
put a whole bunch you could put one
whatever<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.830> feel<00:05:28.949> like<00:05:29.009> it<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.520> usually<00:05:30.060> just

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
whatever you feel like it I usually just

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.850 
whatever you feel like it I usually just
use<00:05:30.240> my<00:05:30.449> index<00:05:30.690> finger<00:05:30.810> because<00:05:31.199> well<00:05:31.650> that's

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
use my index finger because well that's

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.140 
use my index finger because well that's
time<00:05:32.190> holding<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.610> phone<00:05:32.729> and<00:05:32.940> it<00:05:33.000> makes

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
time holding the phone and it makes

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.000 
time holding the phone and it makes
sense<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.449> me<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:34.050> fingerprint<00:05:34.530> can<00:05:34.650> only<00:05:34.800> be

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
sense to me the fingerprint can only be

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.770 
sense to me the fingerprint can only be
used<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.220> unlock<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.729> phone<00:05:35.909> so<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.300> can't

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
used to unlock the phone so you can't

use it for NFC payments since there's no

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.790 
use it for NFC payments since there's no

this<00:05:48.960> advertised<00:05:49.560> by<00:05:49.800> l'a<00:05:49.949> phone<00:05:50.220> for<00:05:50.669> this

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
this advertised by l'a phone for this

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.820 
this advertised by l'a phone for this
specific<00:05:51.090> phone<00:05:51.539> but<00:05:52.139> I<00:05:52.169> couldn't<00:05:52.260> find<00:05:52.710> it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
specific phone but I couldn't find it

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.950 
specific phone but I couldn't find it
anywhere<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.250> settings<00:05:53.580> so<00:05:54.090> we'll<00:05:54.930> just

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
anywhere in the settings so we'll just

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.839 
anywhere in the settings so we'll just
say<00:05:55.320> it<00:05:55.349> doesn't<00:05:55.590> have<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.949> for<00:05:56.190> now<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.669> last

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
say it doesn't have it for now the last

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.219 
say it doesn't have it for now the last
thing<00:05:56.970> is<00:05:57.150> just<00:05:57.270> scheduled<00:05:57.630> power<00:05:57.840> on<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.169> off

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
thing is just scheduled power on and off

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.839 
thing is just scheduled power on and off
so<00:05:58.530> if<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.680> want<00:05:58.860> your<00:05:59.009> phone<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.250> power<00:05:59.699> on

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
so if you want your phone to power on

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.550 
so if you want your phone to power on
and<00:06:00.030> off<00:06:00.090> automatically<00:06:00.780> then<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.199> can<00:06:01.320> go<00:06:01.440> in

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
and off automatically then you can go in

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.409 
and off automatically then you can go in
there<00:06:01.710> it's<00:06:01.860> really<00:06:02.099> self-explanatory<00:06:02.419> we'll

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
there it's really self-explanatory we'll

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.700 
there it's really self-explanatory we'll
just<00:06:03.570> look<00:06:03.630> at<00:06:03.750> a<00:06:03.840> few<00:06:03.990> of<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.139> applications

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
just look at a few of the applications

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.529 
just look at a few of the applications
elephone<00:06:05.009> has<00:06:05.250> on<00:06:05.430> here<00:06:05.639> so<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.330> have<00:06:06.509> your

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
elephone has on here so you have your

elephone has on here so you have your
personalization<00:06:07.530> which<00:06:07.830> is<00:06:07.949> going<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.130> be<00:06:08.190> a

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
personalization which is going to be a

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.180 
personalization which is going to be a
theme<00:06:08.580> support<00:06:09.090> now<00:06:09.659> this<00:06:10.380> is<00:06:10.440> usually<00:06:10.979> pretty

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
theme support now this is usually pretty

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.279 
theme support now this is usually pretty
slow<00:06:11.669> over<00:06:12.090> in<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.330> u.s.<00:06:12.570> it<00:06:12.780> has<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.080> grab<00:06:13.259> it

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
slow over in the u.s. it has to grab it

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.050 
slow over in the u.s. it has to grab it
from<00:06:13.470> Chinese<00:06:13.860> servers<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:14.699> guess<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:15.030> just

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
from Chinese servers and I guess it just

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.760 
from Chinese servers and I guess it just
has<00:06:15.300> to<00:06:15.419> go<00:06:15.509> through<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.780> great<00:06:15.960> firewall<00:06:16.380> or

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
has to go through the great firewall or

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.610 
has to go through the great firewall or
something<00:06:17.099> because<00:06:17.280> it<00:06:17.580> takes<00:06:17.759> forever<00:06:18.090> to

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
something because it takes forever to

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.040 
something because it takes forever to
pop<00:06:19.620> these<00:06:19.770> up<00:06:20.009> to<00:06:20.039> download<00:06:20.580> them<00:06:20.759> in<00:06:21.050> general
