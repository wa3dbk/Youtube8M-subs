hello Marlon hello Tyler how hard is
your<00:00:33.800> thing<00:00:34.129> very<00:00:35.230> let's<00:00:36.230> have<00:00:36.379> a<00:00:36.410> look<00:00:36.590> at<00:00:36.710> it

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.970 

it<00:00:44.580> looks<00:00:44.850> pretty<00:00:45.090> hard<00:00:45.440> what<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it looks pretty hard what is it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.750 
it looks pretty hard what is it
it's<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:47.760> cast<00:00:48.030> iron<00:00:48.240> cockerel

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.970 

is<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.239> made<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.690> stern<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.200> gray<00:00:55.469> iron

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
is it a made of stern as gray iron

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
is it a made of stern as gray iron
which<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:56.460> lower<00:00:56.879> tensile<00:00:57.210> strength<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
which has lower tensile strength and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.780 
which has lower tensile strength and
ductility<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.649> modern<00:00:58.949> engineered<00:00:59.430> irons

ductility the modern engineered irons

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.579 
ductility the modern engineered irons
meaning<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.570> prone<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> fracture

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.430 

well<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.920> looks<00:01:05.190> hard<00:01:05.550> but<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.690> hard<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
well it looks hard but just how hard is

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.969 
well it looks hard but just how hard is
it<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> first<00:01:09.390> test<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.080> impact<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> ton

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it the first test is an impact of a ton

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:11.630 
it the first test is an impact of a ton
of<00:01:11.009> bricks

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of bricks

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870 
of bricks
yeah<00:01:12.060> Ella<00:01:12.450> boys<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.650> cast<00:01:14.009> iron<00:01:14.610> was

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
yeah Ella boys this cast iron was

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.430 
yeah Ella boys this cast iron was
designed<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> stand<00:01:15.659> tall<00:01:16.020> through<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
designed to stand tall through the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.800 
designed to stand tall through the
extremes<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.310> english<00:01:17.670> seasons<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.570> will

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
extremes of the english seasons but will

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
extremes of the english seasons but will
it<00:01:18.899> stand<00:01:19.200> firm<00:01:19.560> against<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.190> ton<00:01:20.399> of<00:01:20.430> bricks

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it stand firm against a ton of bricks

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
it stand firm against a ton of bricks
from<00:01:21.030> 60<00:01:21.540> feet<00:01:21.570> 3

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.390 

it's<00:01:35.340> completely<00:01:36.060> flattened<00:01:36.870> I<00:01:37.280> think<00:01:38.280> we'll

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's completely flattened I think we'll

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.040 
it's completely flattened I think we'll
be<00:01:38.520> lucky<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> even<00:01:38.850> find<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.540> clock<00:01:39.720> after

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
be lucky to even find the clock after

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.190 
be lucky to even find the clock after
that<00:01:40.200> hit<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.850> appalling<00:01:42.540> display

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that hit and this appalling display

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.330 
that hit and this appalling display
earns<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.770> cop<00:01:44.010> just<00:01:44.040> 1<00:01:44.580> out<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> 10

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
earns a cop just 1 out of 10

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220 
earns a cop just 1 out of 10
so<00:01:48.340> far<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.880> cockerel<00:01:49.360> has<00:01:49.570> failed<00:01:49.930> to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
so far the cockerel has failed to

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.680 
so far the cockerel has failed to
impress<00:01:50.680> but<00:01:51.550> will<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.910> do<00:01:52.120> any<00:01:52.390> better

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
impress but will it do any better

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.950 
impress but will it do any better

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.790 

what's<00:02:21.970> left<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.569> Marlins<00:02:23.050> cockerel<00:02:23.620> is
