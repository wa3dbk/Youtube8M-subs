00:00:05.620 --> 00:01:01.859
10) Nike’s swoosh logo was designed for
$35 by graphic design student Carolyn Davidson

00:01:01.859 --> 00:02:02.300
in 1971.
12 years later Nike thanked her with 500 Nike

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:38.450
stocks, now worth an estimated $643,035.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.579
9) The “Just Do It"" slogan was inspired
by killer Gary Gilmore.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.579
His infamous last words before his firing
squad execution was ""Let's do it”.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.579
8) Early Nike shoes were made with a waffle
iron to create the sole of the trainer.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.579
The design was to help athletes grip running
tracks &amp; was patented in 1974.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.579
7) Riots broke out across America in 2011
after a re-release of Air Jordans.

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.579
Police smashed a car window to save 2 toddlers
after their mom abandoned them to buy the

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.579
shoes.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.579
6) Their Kanye West trainer Air Yeezy 2 ‘Red
October’ sold out in 10 minutes.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.579
The retail price was $245; a pair were sold
on eBay for $15,000.

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.579
5) A pimp attempted to sue Nike for $100 million
after being imprisoned for stomping a man

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.579
in the head.
He claimed Nike failed to provide a warning

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.579
that their shoes could be used as dangerous
weapons.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.609
4) A Nike commercial was the first ever YouTube
video to hit a million views.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.609
The 2005 video shows football player Ronaldinho
doing a reality-defying crossbar challenge.

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.609
3) Nike patented an “automatic lacing system”
in 2010 that can open &amp; close shoe straps

00:02:58.609 --> 00:02:59.609
using a motor unit.
They claim the Back to the Future shoes will

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.609
arrive in 2015.

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.609
2) Nike made a commercial translating a Samburu
tribesman as saying “Just Do it” in his

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.230
native language.
They didn’t think anyone would realise the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.230
tribesman actually says “I don’t want
these, give me big shoes”.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.230
1) Michael Jordan earned more annually for
endorsing Nike…

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240
...than the collective 30,000 Indonesian workers
who made the shoes.
