00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.019 

we're<00:00:15.290> building<00:00:15.769> these<00:00:15.919> sequences<00:00:16.609> on<00:00:16.820> the

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
we're building these sequences on the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.390 
we're building these sequences on the
pentatonic<00:00:17.539> scale<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.230> then<00:00:18.680> from<00:00:18.890> there<00:00:19.160> we

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
pentatonic scale and then from there we

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.120 
pentatonic scale and then from there we
add<00:00:19.609> the<00:00:19.939> notes<00:00:20.210> of<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.449> major<00:00:20.570> scale<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:21.590> we

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
add the notes of the major scale so we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.890 
add the notes of the major scale so we
basically<00:00:22.310> end<00:00:22.820> up<00:00:23.000> playing<00:00:23.269> all<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:23.720> notes

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
basically end up playing all the notes

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.480 
basically end up playing all the notes
of<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.109> major<00:00:24.230> scale<00:00:24.590> but<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:24.949> basic

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
of the major scale but the basic

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.269 
of the major scale but the basic
structure<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.330> panettone<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.710> pentatonic

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
structure is panettone the pentatonic

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.269 
structure is panettone the pentatonic
scale<00:00:28.699> is<00:00:28.880> very<00:00:29.240> close<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.599> being<00:00:29.840> a<00:00:30.199> minor<00:00:30.590> 7th

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
scale is very close to being a minor 7th

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.810 
scale is very close to being a minor 7th
arpeggio<00:00:31.849> in<00:00:32.300> fact<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:33.380> is<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.740> minor<00:00:34.100> 7th<00:00:34.490> up<00:00:34.670> at

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
arpeggio in fact it is a minor 7th up at

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.790 
arpeggio in fact it is a minor 7th up at
you<00:00:34.970> with<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.360> addition<00:00:35.900> of<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.200> fourth<00:00:36.500> in

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
you with the addition of the fourth in

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.250 
you with the addition of the fourth in
the<00:00:36.980> scale<00:00:37.220> so<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:37.880> could<00:00:38.120> see<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.600> as<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> minor

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
the scale so you could see it as a minor

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.300 
the scale so you could see it as a minor
7th<00:00:39.890> at<00:00:40.120> 11th<00:00:41.120> arpeggio<00:00:41.630> because<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.620> 11th<00:00:43.130> is

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
7th at 11th arpeggio because the 11th is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.790 
7th at 11th arpeggio because the 11th is
the<00:00:43.610> fourth<00:00:43.940> only<00:00:44.420> one<00:00:44.600> octave<00:00:45.020> higher<00:00:45.050> it

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
the fourth only one octave higher it

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.770 
the fourth only one octave higher it
really<00:00:46.160> doesn't<00:00:46.490> matter<00:00:46.610> what<00:00:47.060> it<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:47.210> the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
really doesn't matter what it is the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.320 
really doesn't matter what it is the
point<00:00:48.080> is<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.440> by<00:00:49.160> using<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.940> pentatonic

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
point is that by using the pentatonic

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.050 
point is that by using the pentatonic
scale<00:00:50.780> for<00:00:51.290> these<00:00:51.410> runs<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:52.190> get<00:00:52.430> more<00:00:52.640> space

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
scale for these runs we get more space

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.420 
scale for these runs we get more space
in<00:00:53.360> between<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.930> notes<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.380> we<00:00:54.950> get<00:00:55.130> a<00:00:55.160> more

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
in between the notes and we get a more

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
in between the notes and we get a more
open<00:00:56.000> more<00:00:56.270> crazy<00:00:57.080> more<00:00:57.620> neurotic<00:00:58.490> sound<00:00:59.030> than

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
open more crazy more neurotic sound than

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.740 
open more crazy more neurotic sound than
if<00:00:59.780> we<00:01:00.200> stuck<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.650> the<00:01:00.770> major<00:01:00.980> scale<00:01:01.540> also<00:01:02.540> the

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
if we stuck to the major scale also the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.990 
if we stuck to the major scale also the
pentatonic<00:01:03.230> scale<00:01:03.680> works<00:01:03.980> very<00:01:04.370> well<00:01:04.519> in<00:01:04.730> a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
pentatonic scale works very well in a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.930 
pentatonic scale works very well in a
blue<00:01:05.269> spaced<00:01:05.690> rock<00:01:06.170> context<00:01:06.980> and<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:07.790> a

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
blue spaced rock context and in a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.110 
blue spaced rock context and in a
melodic<00:01:08.270> rock<00:01:08.690> or<00:01:08.900> pop<00:01:09.230> context<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:10.820> the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
melodic rock or pop context and it's the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.350 
melodic rock or pop context and it's the
most<00:01:11.330> basic<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.110> most<00:01:12.290> widely<00:01:13.130> used<00:01:13.360> soling

it's a really good place to put some
focus<00:01:19.720> now<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.200> probably<00:01:21.530> know<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.190> basic

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
focus now you probably know the basic

focus now you probably know the basic
shapes<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.300> pentatonic<00:01:23.900> scale<00:01:24.380> there<00:01:24.980> are

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
shapes of the pentatonic scale there are

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.520 
shapes of the pentatonic scale there are
five<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.730> them<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.180> they<00:01:26.630> are<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:27.020> very<00:01:27.050> nice

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
five of them and they are a very nice

five of them and they are a very nice
tool<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.130> have<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.430> your<00:01:28.460> toolbox<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:29.420> this

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
tool to have in your toolbox in this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.710 
tool to have in your toolbox in this
program<00:01:30.710> we're<00:01:31.670> not<00:01:31.790> going<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.180> use<00:01:32.210> these

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
program we're not going to use these

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.960 
program we're not going to use these
shapes<00:01:33.170> as<00:01:33.350> we<00:01:33.710> will<00:01:33.860> create<00:01:34.100> some<00:01:34.460> different

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
shapes as we will create some different

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.940 
shapes as we will create some different
ones<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.480> are<00:01:35.570> somewhat<00:01:35.990> harder<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.650> play

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
ones that are somewhat harder to play

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.250 
ones that are somewhat harder to play
but<00:01:37.670> they<00:01:37.970> have<00:01:38.180> some<00:01:38.390> very<00:01:38.450> radical

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
but they have some very radical

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.850 
but they have some very radical
advantages<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.330> a<00:01:41.420> way<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.630> pay<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.530> little

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
advantages so in a way you pay a little

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.890 
advantages so in a way you pay a little
extra<00:01:43.130> by<00:01:43.550> literary<00:01:43.909> stretching<00:01:44.780> yourself

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
extra by literary stretching yourself

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.219 
extra by literary stretching yourself
but<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.890> get<00:01:46.070> tons<00:01:46.580> back<00:01:47.000> instead<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.870> laying

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
but you get tons back instead of laying

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
but you get tons back instead of laying
out<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.740> scales<00:01:49.070> two<00:01:49.700> notes<00:01:50.000> per<00:01:50.210> string<00:01:50.240> and

out the scales two notes per string and
