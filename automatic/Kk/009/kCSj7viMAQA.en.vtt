off with on this application is you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
off with on this application is you
create<00:00:42.690> your<00:00:42.780> layout<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.579> define

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
create your layout you have you define

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.970 
create your layout you have you define
all<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> points<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> routes<00:00:46.800> of

track and all the objects around it and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
track and all the objects around it and
you<00:00:49.020> build<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.649> once<00:00:50.309> you've<00:00:50.460> created

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you build that up once you've created

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
you build that up once you've created
your<00:00:50.879> layout<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.500> your

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
your layout you then put all your

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
your layout you then put all your
locomotives<00:00:53.370> onto<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.210> I've<00:00:54.360> got<00:00:54.539> all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
locomotives onto it so here I've got all

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.369 
locomotives onto it so here I've got all
my<00:00:54.719> engines<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.739> trains<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.910> all

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
my engines of all my trains are all

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.630 
my engines of all my trains are all
specified<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> big<00:00:58.800> list<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
specified in the big list here so the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
specified in the big list here so the
computer<00:01:00.090> knows<00:01:00.120> how<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> control<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
computer knows how to control them and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
computer knows how to control them and
also<00:01:01.920> understands<00:01:02.640> characteristics<00:01:03.420> about

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
also understands characteristics about

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
also understands characteristics about
them<00:01:03.930> which<00:01:04.080> makes<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.100> sensitive<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
them which makes it so sensitive to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.179 
them which makes it so sensitive to
taking<00:01:06.750> trains<00:01:07.049> aways<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.770> standing

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
taking trains aways from a standing

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.600 
taking trains aways from a standing
start<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> operating<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.689> realistic<00:01:10.200> speeds

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
start and operating at realistic speeds

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
start and operating at realistic speeds
so<00:01:11.610> having<00:01:11.909> defined<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.659> engines<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so having defined all your engines the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
so having defined all your engines the
next<00:01:13.530> thing<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.220> inside<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
next thing you have to do inside the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.109 
next thing you have to do inside the
train<00:01:15.180> controller<00:01:15.570> application<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:17.119> define

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
train controller application is define

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.080 
train controller application is define
the<00:01:18.360> logical<00:01:18.979> architecture<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> layout

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the logical architecture of the layout

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
the logical architecture of the layout
you<00:01:21.900> define<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> logical<00:01:23.220> blocks<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you define all the logical blocks that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
you define all the logical blocks that
there<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> layout<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
there are on the layout we have about a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
there are on the layout we have about a
hundred<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:25.979> fifty<00:01:26.220> blocks<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.150> take<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
hundred and fifty blocks that can take a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.899 
hundred and fifty blocks that can take a
full<00:01:27.689> length<00:01:27.900> train<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:29.490> each<00:01:29.579> block

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
full length train and from each block

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
full length train and from each block
there<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> predefined<00:01:31.320> path<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.860> you're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
there is a predefined path that you're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.499 
there is a predefined path that you're
going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> take<00:01:32.430> through<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> series<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.210> points

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
going to take through a series of points

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
going to take through a series of points
to<00:01:33.659> another<00:01:33.930> block<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.710> example<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
to another block for example that this

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.760 
to another block for example that this
here<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.150> platform's<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> Birmingham<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
here is the platform's of Birmingham and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.460 
here is the platform's of Birmingham and
each<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.520> those<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:39.360> different<00:01:39.390> paths<00:01:40.140> out

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
each of those have different paths out

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
each of those have different paths out
of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> station<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> define

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
of the station and you have to define

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
of the station and you have to define
all<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.810> those<00:01:43.079> things<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> computer

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
all of those things so the computer

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.149 
all of those things so the computer
knows<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:45.360> points<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.899> set<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.560> from

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
knows what points to set to get from

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.819 
knows what points to set to get from

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
there you then create things called

now<00:02:14.010> what<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.940> does<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.510> isolation<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.160> it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
now what this does in isolation and it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.220 
now what this does in isolation and it
looks<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.640> bit<00:02:17.670> sort<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> skin<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.080> the

looks a bit sort of skin but this is the
