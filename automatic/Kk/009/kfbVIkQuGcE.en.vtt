a way to clean it up a bit should make

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.460 
a way to clean it up a bit should make
the<00:03:34.560> flowers<00:03:35.100> stand<00:03:35.520> out<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.970> Ibelin<00:03:36.470> without

the flowers stand out of Ibelin without
painting<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.010> because<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.250> don't<00:03:38.520> want<00:03:38.580> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
