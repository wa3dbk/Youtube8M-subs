00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 the quote of the day control of esa 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.660
 that a psychologist and she says pearl 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.139
 Fire needs air and what it means 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.240
 is that passion air needs because 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.539
 You have to experience the passion 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 at the same time give each room and that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.779
 is what we often do not perceive 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.430
 but we imagine that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.960
 Passion means that you always 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.820
 go closer you always more and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 more and more and more must have and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 that one may not deviate from one 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.300
 that you look at yourself always 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.520
 must regularly see for example that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.820
 you can not miss that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.559
 you can not be separated and these 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 Ideas that goes for a bit 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 back what the philosopher awards times 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 he said he always plays 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.350
 this game is black against white and we 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.910
 the idea must be black 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.129
 lose and knows must win 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 but what we do not understand is that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 black can not exist without white 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 and I know without black 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.640
 exist you need the contrast 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.039
 in which 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 and if you spend time in a room 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.930
 if only it would be white where it was not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 black give then you would in a short 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.780
 not perceive anything at all 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.820
 You can be in a short time at all 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.040
 can not see anymore and knows 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.560
 would not exist any more as well 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.060
 aquatic fish does not exist 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 because all the time in the water water 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.229
 lives because he does not have anything against it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.869
 can only compare 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.170
 That's why there is a relationship 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.829
 always from it the fire and air in 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.630
 this scale will move that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.640
 both are always the most in this one 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.890
 Settlement relationship that you on the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 one page of course the proximity to hate 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 Of course, one side has intimacy 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.720
 that you do not take anyone that you 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.329
 you exchange with someone you 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.140
 much time each spends the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.479
 a page 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 but you can only enjoy all that and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.380
 the value of all you can only 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.320
 perceive as long as it is the other 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.299
 are pages that is because the vacuum 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.869
 means that the other person is not there 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.990
 is that you are not available for 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.349
 the other person 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.020
 that you give each other space that 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.540
 you do not always know exactly what the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.510
 Others just do not make 100 percent 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.950
 You know you have both levels 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.720
 you have both levels you have on the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.000
 one side the fire on the other 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.480
 Side had the air and in the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.670
 Instantly where you start the air 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.890
 to give up if you have so much intimacy 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.080
 or have so much intimacy and so on 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.950
 is have a lot near that they never 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.739
 be separated 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.569
 then the point comes where you fire the starting 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.319
 probably work in the fire because oxygen 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.209
 Take and where the relationship ends 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.790
 goes against it just like a flame 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.049
 that's why the cancer is so bad 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.140
 always an interplay you always need 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.360
 both you can not have a fire without 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.060
 that you also have air can not do it 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.190
 have black without whats on it 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.170
 this dance is both 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.819
 if you look at the dance, what is it? 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.799
 Dance dance is not just when you look at yourself 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.989
 holds tight and that was but one 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.090
 Dance gets its intimacy and its 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.489
 just because of this 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.290
 interplay from near and then again 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.030
 push away and then close again and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.680
 then push away again and that this 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.019
 play what the whole thing interesting 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.880
 not only does proximity not only do that 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.720
 otherwise push away this interplay 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.239
 from both 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.840
 and so can you also your relationship 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.250
 Life 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.530
 you do not need to believe you need it 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.350
 you have to commit your own condition 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.150
 cement because of the proximity condition 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.739
 or the state of self-employment 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.840
 you do not have to get stuck 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.350
 otherwise perpetuate straight on the exchange 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.920
 in which 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.440
 this time that is that and that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.480
 this tension is that 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.970
 what you feel that's what the whole 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.290
 makes life alive as well as the quote of the day 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 and see you in the next video
