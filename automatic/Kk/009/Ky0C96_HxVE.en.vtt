hello<00:00:02.520> there<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:02.970> welcome<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.959> time<00:00:04.350> as<00:00:04.529> it<00:00:04.710> is

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello there and welcome to time as it is

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.960 
hello there and welcome to time as it is
what<00:00:06.690> should<00:00:06.899> be<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.400> citizen

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
what should be this is the citizen

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.490 
what should be this is the citizen
equals<00:00:09.269> ela<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.630> equal<00:00:10.110> track<00:00:10.290> movement

equals ela with equal track movement

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.850 
equals ela with equal track movement
which<00:00:11.460> basically<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.599> woman<00:00:13.200> feed<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.679> light

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
which basically the woman feed on light

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.779 
which basically the woman feed on light
any<00:00:14.400> kind<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.700> light<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.809> source<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.230> energy

this has this watch has will be what we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 
this has this watch has will be what we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
will automatically move into this seed

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
will automatically move into this seed
mode<00:00:57.360> whereby<00:00:58.140> during<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:59.399> period<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.230> hand

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
will move instead of every single second

will move instead of every single second
it<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.769> move<00:01:05.390> every<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:07.080> seconds<00:01:07.790> which

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it will move every two seconds which

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.890 
it will move every two seconds which
kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> slow<00:01:09.710> as<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
kind of slow as you can see in this

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.359 
kind of slow as you can see in this
video

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
video

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.539 
video
towards<00:01:14.990> second<00:01:15.990> hands

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
towards second hands

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.170 
towards second hands
it<00:01:17.549> moves<00:01:17.880> every<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:19.080> seconds<00:01:19.880> by<00:01:20.880> doing<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it moves every two seconds by doing that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.850 
it moves every two seconds by doing that
it<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:21.900> conserve<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> energy<00:01:24.860> go

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it actually conserve the energy go

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
it actually conserve the energy go
allowing<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:27.770> last<00:01:28.770> longer

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
allowing it to last longer

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.210 
allowing it to last longer
so<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:33.990> cool<00:01:34.200> features<00:01:35.010> from

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so it's pretty cool features from

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.400 
so it's pretty cool features from
citizen<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:37.190> being<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.310> diaper<00:01:38.580> watch

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
citizen and being a diaper watch

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.830 
citizen and being a diaper watch
especially<00:01:40.410> when<00:01:40.620> considering<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.840> there's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
especially when considering that there's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.400 
especially when considering that there's
a<00:01:42.930> possibility<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.620> will<00:01:43.800> be<00:01:45.410> staying

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
a possibility that you will be staying

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.660 
a possibility that you will be staying
but<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.520> long<00:01:47.910> time<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.750> total<00:01:49.050> darkness<00:01:49.670> that's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
but a long time in total darkness that's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.660 
but a long time in total darkness that's
right<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.150> this<00:01:51.270> watch<00:01:51.480> can<00:01:51.870> actually

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
right here in this watch can actually

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.720 
right here in this watch can actually
accompany<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.300> up<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.750> 300<00:01:55.230> meter<00:01:55.470> diving

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
accompany you to up to 300 meter diving

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.240 
accompany you to up to 300 meter diving
so<00:01:56.730> this<00:01:57.660> kind<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:57.930> features<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.980> really

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so this kind of features will really

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.140 
so this kind of features will really
help<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.610> as<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.570> diver<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.120> now

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
help you as a diver that's all for now

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.200 
help you as a diver that's all for now
thank<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.080> watching
