00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 for a few years now a new 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.850
 transforming brazilian gastronomy 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.220
 chief in the TV celebrities 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.570
 At the same time a phenomenon spread 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.469
 chic restaurants 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:20.820
 the clay counters Watercolor betiza are by 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.769
 this is happening until the beginning 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 of the past decade when talking about 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 Brazil best restaurants soon 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 I was thinking of a house in a 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 supra sumo service of french cuisine 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 or Italian 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.469
 today the scenario is more diversified by 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 three reasons first because the country 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.290
 It got magical and started to eat more outside 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.480
 From home 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 apart from this there was also a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 TV behavior 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.829
 today as well as culinary shows 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.539
 success on the internet and social networks 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 to spread a habit of discovering dishes 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.000
 shoot and share finally have 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.300
 international highlight in 2006 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
 the chef alex ties this restaurant don 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.809
 debuted on the British magazine list 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 restaurant of the 50 best restaurants 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
 of the planet 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 it was enough for more people to spend 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.119
 to accompany the world of new gastronomy 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.330
 Brazilian over time the dow came up 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.479
 positions reached the fourth place in 2012 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.430
 and opened space for a new culture 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 national gastronomy in 2003 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 the four-wheel decorating guide 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 maximum for four restaurants 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 Italians two French and one Portuguese 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.250
 in 2013 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.920
 of the country's six best restaurants 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.880
 four alia traditions ingredients 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.799
 Brazilians 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.470
 the technique of contemporary cooking 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700
 You're better off doing the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.890
 rest runs behind 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.950
 for the first time we bosses are not 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 only by applying consecrated revenues 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.110
 but creating an identity but this does not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 born here came from there even in france 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.570
 in the 1960s a group of chefs 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.710
 french 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.079
 dissatisfied with the refinement of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.329
 techniques of the largest 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.219
 restaurants in the world swerved in 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.780
 towards a kitchen more focused on the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.549
 taste of ingredients 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.560
 the idea was to maintain the essence of 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.410
 French cuisine but one way 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 simple and affordable movement 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.670
 called old 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.100
 yes it was marked by the exchange of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.500
 extreme east european experiences 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.470
 east and south america to enter 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.170
 route of these chefs looking for flavors 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.870
 The wave arrived in Brazil in the 80's with 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.660
 the pain and the pain 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.880
 the pair of merged methods and influenced 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 a generation mainly in the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.290
 valorization of national products 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.820
 while this wave took shape in the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.520
 big capitals 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.820
 another phenomenon arises based on the 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.490
 even context of magic people 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.890
 interested in a food, let's say 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.750
 differentiated the tização of the gun 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.930
 supermarket gondolas 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.300
 the hot boot tables a lot 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.550
 earned its gourmet version the new 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.890
 Brazilian gastronomy and administration 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.590
 are two sides of the coin that help 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.720
 To explain how one eats in Brazil 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.240
 gastronomic revolution of a country if 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.100
 based on three pillars is basically 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.780
 need to have a culture that values 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.760
 eating well 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.459
 a logistical and technological structure 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.290
 to work with this production to 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.209
 dish and a population with money 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.370
 enough to eat out of time 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.320
 while in Brazil as we have seen 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.709
 there was a significant increase in income 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.360
 and the emergence of a generation of chefs 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.290
 willing to value colors and flavors 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.320
 regional 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.330
 culture 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.790
 hunger with the urge to eat more 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.190
 leaving aside know what to eat 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.770
 how much to spend is the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.470
 globalization of everything takes a coxinha 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.600
 metal ossobuco and you will have a quitute 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.300
 not necessarily better but 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.459
 certainly more expensive by the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.470
 consumerism instead of investing in a 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.560
 cuisine and for all 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.590
 to create dishes that conquer 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.000
 One world gives way to attempts to 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.790
 wheel reinvention 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.560
 the gourmet thong is still just a coxinha 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.140
 This is because brazil does not have a 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.840
 strong gastronomic culture despite the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.600
 a rich food base created by all 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.209
 people who arrived here from the indexes to 15 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.820
 thousand years and the Japanese to little more than 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.799
 100 we do not pay much attention to food 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.620
 the first school for chef training 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.030
 the country appeared in 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.660
 194 99 years after the first school 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.880
 world 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.880
 le cordon bleu the renowned institution 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.650
 has subsidiaries in 13 countries in 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.320
 all continents 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.330
 but only in 2011 came the plan to come 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.760
 To Brazil, it 's a very real reality. 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.320
 different from that of another country 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.100
 gastronomy was influenced by nugali 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.340
 cosin the turkey where the food is pride 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.340
 national in Lima people talk about 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.199
 street recipes taxi drivers point out 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.900
 restaurants as if they were attractions 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.240
 and there are social programs 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.289
 to take children off the street and transform 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.930
 in cooks 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.449
 the gastronomy is their football there is a 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.479
 planning for this seven years ago. 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.400
 example was created the biggest fair mix 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.590
 gastronomic outside europe 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.070
 it brings together people from all stages of 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.850
 garden chain the table including the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.889
 public 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.590
 this creates a relation to things between 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.850
 producers and heads united by the same 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.750
 end 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.389
 good food around here difficult access to 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.580
 lack of incentive logistics leaves 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.070
 clear for the boss to have access to 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.450
 and this reflects in the price 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.060
 end of the plate 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.430
 already the goal and turned everyday newspaper 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.740
 daily the state of são paulo raised 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.580
 how many times the word appears in your 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.960

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:53.710
 from the first time in 1901 to the years 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.530
 70 were less than 10 per year 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.960
 in the following decades the rate rose to 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.000
 about 80 times a year 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:09.550
 at the turn of the century soared in 2005 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.460
 1,144 times in 2010 5077 an average of 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.560
 13.9 per 6 per day 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.380
 partly because of the explosion of 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.930
 products with high quality 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.599
 higher than the original but the term 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.760
 so analyzed that it has slipped out of 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.979
 cooking notebooks today you 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.229
 You can take a popsicle to sleep in the queue .

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.410
 the draft on the gourmet balcony in the absence 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.780
 of a solid gastronomic culture 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.240
 brazil shoot everywhere and open 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.070
 much more room for me some banal

 turkey, for example head of 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.210
 engaged producers will not be able to 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.600
 from the night to the day that Brazilian food 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.490
 It has a better treatment but it's a start. 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.280
 Meanwhile, we're on our way to 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.620
 have the best restaurant in the world as

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.020
 So what do you think of the new kitchen? 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.039
