00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you can trim it back to the next leaf

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
you can trim it back to the next leaf
which<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.780> fine<00:01:13.189> now<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.340> far<00:01:14.549> as

which would be fine now as far as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.820 
which would be fine now as far as

a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.479> tricky<00:01:33.960> because

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
a little tricky because

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
a little tricky because

themselves to cool themselves off so
you'll<00:01:44.909> find<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.390> sometimes<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> your

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you'll find out sometimes that your

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
you'll find out sometimes that your
ficus<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.579> dry<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.820> faster<00:01:48.420> than

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
ficus will will dry out faster than

ficus will will dry out faster than
other<00:01:48.750> times<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.829> what<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.130> recommend<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.640> do

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
other times so what we recommend to do

every<00:02:10.860> couple<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.220> weeks<00:02:11.280> would<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.700> plenty<00:02:12.120> of
