00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 On ps4, in general, attacks of 4 thousand each 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.960
 1 x box fatma face from but usually exactly 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 Such arguments are typical package 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.360
 nicknames that ps4 and xbox one shit 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.730
 supposedly there is little pixel and face kintso but 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.010
 appeared on a very interesting news on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 days there was an exhibition of children g and there 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 submitted what do you think 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 gives x12 I'm always pretty calm 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.519
 treated gives x11 x10 even possible 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.300
 say did not think about it for what 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.730
 then etc. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 but in fact it turned out that what gives x12 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 creates some 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.579
 revolution this look at the tests 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890
 video cards that support dx12 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.410
 let's say the same vidyuha time thing in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 In this form, I then we will see what gives 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.480
 x12 almost any vidyuha becomes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.870
 much more powerful if you take a video card 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.660
 r9 290x then it becomes 400 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 percent more powerful at 400 if you take 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 vidyuha ati nvidia then it becomes on 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 200 percent stronger than it is, it turns 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.850
 you can just upgrade goretex 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 and your will become really more powerful and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 faster as you understand gives them 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.689
 created by microsoft 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.119
 they also own and xbox one in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.580
 xbox one costs iron a mt so 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.490
 it is logical that he is x-box one also 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.580
 x12 will appear and it will appear 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.340
 already in November 2015 exactly the same 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.259
 will take place windows 10 who does not know 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 windows 10 go out and xbox one 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.000
 therefore there will appear and support gives 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.119
 x12 as you know now xbox consoles 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.189
 one is a little behind ps4 in quantity 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.170
 pixels so we can go to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.869
 interesting site and see here 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.070
 How far is their xbox one behind in 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.579
 same battlefield on ps4 1600 by 900 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 xbox one 1280 to 720 galdite voice on 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.369
 ps4 1080p x-box one 720 principle such 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 differences are quite common 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.469
 now but as they promise T-shirts 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.020
 they will fix everything and this fall on the xbox 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.409
 one we will see stable 1080p and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.250
 maybe even 60 fps company already 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.320
 declared hit to give x 12 x 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.810
 swan process exactly like xbox one and 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.670
 will be 20 percent more powerful 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.290
 release will finish anything else there 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.220
 will come up tired and by 30 percent 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.320
 more powerful 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.690
 in principle, about as much as x-box one 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.820
 and lags behind the power of ps4 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.730
 so everything goes to the fact that in principle 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.950
 consoles most likely at the end of 2015 in 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.010
 By the beginning of 2016, both consoles will be 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.590
 run everything in 1080p and finally 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.140
 end this whining about what's on 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.080
 consoles there face little pixels this is an accident 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.390
 and people will stop buying ps4 only 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.180
 because there are supposedly more pixels 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.070
 so we are waiting for November in November, we will be shown 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.140
 windows 10 gives x12 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.390
 and it will all be up to their zbox van therefore 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.340
 if all this turns out to be true then what are we 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.010
 now they say in words it will be 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.840
 awesome and xbox one is finally so 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.230
 say not to rise from your knees 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.440
 but 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.690
 will be on a par with ps4 and maybe people 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.760
 it will be easier to decide what to buy x-box one 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 or ps4 then people won't be 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.310
 look purely at pixels and will 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.440
 buy console 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.600
 it is for exclusive where exclusives 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.940
 better that and buy and not as now 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.459
 people are watching and pixels more than that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.110
 console buys it pretty stupid a and 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.030
 I would also like to add that 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.860
 x-box will present you a new gamepad on 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.840
 the exhibition e3 2015 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.120
 supposedly this gamepad is perfect for 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.220
 shooters and if you like anyone in dyuti 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.019
 battlefield then this gamepad you need 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.940
 will buy until nothing is known but 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.890
 basically a xbox one gamepad and so 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.230
 quite perfect he's really big 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.450
 comfortable but if you do even better it 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.489
 it will be cool on this do not forget 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.380
 like this video and of course
