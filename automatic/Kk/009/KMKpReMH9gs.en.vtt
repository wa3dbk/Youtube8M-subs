is very close to his heart hopefully in
10<00:00:39.989> years<00:00:40.140> time<00:00:40.230> we'll<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> much<00:00:41.219> smaller

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
10 years time we'll have a much smaller

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.090 
10 years time we'll have a much smaller
battery<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.600> weighs<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> lot<00:00:43.350> less<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.950> goes

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
battery that weighs a lot less but goes

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.560 
battery that weighs a lot less but goes
twice<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> distance<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.510> more<00:00:45.690> power

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.440 

if<00:00:49.470> we<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.550> improve<00:00:51.270> our

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
if we can do that and improve our

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.080 
if we can do that and improve our
performance<00:00:51.739> via<00:00:52.739> having<00:00:53.460> involvement<00:00:53.940> with

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
performance via having involvement with

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150 
performance via having involvement with
manufactures<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.559> put<00:00:55.980> onto

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
manufactures that can then be put onto

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.570 
manufactures that can then be put onto
the<00:00:56.309> production<00:00:56.730> line<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.900> sold<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
the production line and then sold on the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.640 
the production line and then sold on the
normal<00:00:59.850> roads<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.360> then<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.320> sudden

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
normal roads and then all of a sudden

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.130 
normal roads and then all of a sudden
electric<00:01:02.309> cars<00:01:02.340> look<00:01:02.850> far<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.480> viable<00:01:03.720> for

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
electric cars look far more viable for

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
electric cars look far more viable for
everybody<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> world<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.270> best

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
everybody around the world the best

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
everybody around the world the best
piece<00:01:06.660> of<00:01:06.690> technology<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.920> really

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
piece of technology which I really

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.510 
piece of technology which I really
amazed<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.910> is<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.140> regen<00:01:10.590> paddle<00:01:11.070> we

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
amazed of is the the regen paddle we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
amazed of is the the regen paddle we
always<00:01:11.700> regenerate<00:01:12.509> energy<00:01:13.259> from<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> brakes

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
always regenerate energy from the brakes

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
always regenerate energy from the brakes
but<00:01:14.700> also<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.300> an<00:01:15.420> extra<00:01:15.630> bottle<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
but also we have an extra bottle on the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
but also we have an extra bottle on the
steering<00:01:16.470> wheel<00:01:16.560> where<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.180> when

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
steering wheel where we can use it when

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
steering wheel where we can use it when
you're<00:01:18.720> off<00:01:18.900> power<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.250> regenerate<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you're off power and you regenerate this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
you're off power and you regenerate this
energy<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.990> motor<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.890> very

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
energy on the motor it's very

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.370 
energy on the motor it's very
challenging<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.640> us<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
challenging for us and I think it's a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
challenging for us and I think it's a
way<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> regenerate<00:01:26.490> extra<00:01:27.030> free<00:01:27.300> battery

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
way of regenerate extra free battery

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.850 
way of regenerate extra free battery
from<00:01:27.960> nowhere

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.610 

we<00:01:31.820> are<00:01:31.940> hoping<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.330> performer<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.410> going<00:01:33.560> to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
we are hoping that performer is going to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.910 
we are hoping that performer is going to
appeal<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.670> any<00:01:35.540> generation<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.440> fan<00:01:36.680> but

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
appeal to any generation of a fan but

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.350 
appeal to any generation of a fan but
hopefully<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.430> younger<00:01:37.670> generation<00:01:38.120> of<00:01:38.210> fan

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
hopefully the younger generation of fan

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.990 
hopefully the younger generation of fan
will<00:01:38.510> come<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.920> event<00:01:40.040> see<00:01:40.580> these<00:01:40.730> cars

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
will come to the event see these cars

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.970 
will come to the event see these cars
racing<00:01:41.270> around<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.660> circuit<00:01:42.110> hear<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.770> noise

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
racing around the circuit hear the noise

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.310 
racing around the circuit hear the noise
see<00:01:43.550> these<00:01:43.730> cool<00:01:44.000> cars<00:01:44.270> racing<00:01:44.600> flat<00:01:45.080> out

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
see these cool cars racing flat out

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.469 
see these cool cars racing flat out
really<00:01:45.980> close<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.400> barriers<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.210> think

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
really close to the barriers and think

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.990 
really close to the barriers and think
wow<00:01:47.690> what<00:01:48.620> are<00:01:48.740> these<00:01:48.830> cars<00:01:49.160> they<00:01:49.700> sound

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
wow what are these cars they sound

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.060 
wow what are these cars they sound
really<00:01:50.120> cool<00:01:50.540> their<00:01:51.140> little<00:01:51.380> feature<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.710> stick

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
really cool their little feature a stick

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.630 
really cool their little feature a stick
and<00:01:52.280> that's<00:01:52.640> how<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.970> sort<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.210> starts
