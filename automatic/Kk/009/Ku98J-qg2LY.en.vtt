00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.610
 the possibility of the top and not to break 10 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.410
 points 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.670

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.960
 yourself play such 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.720

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.890

 Here are more large and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580

 which is a beam bedroom indicator that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.350

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.940
