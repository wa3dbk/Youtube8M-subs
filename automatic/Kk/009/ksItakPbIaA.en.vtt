off<00:03:09.319> here<00:03:09.769> no<00:03:10.220> maybe<00:03:10.610> it's<00:03:10.790> because<00:03:10.970> we're<00:03:11.360> so

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
off here no maybe it's because we're so

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.500 
off here no maybe it's because we're so
far<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:12.280> as<00:03:13.280> we're<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.610> far<00:03:13.879> in<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.060> story<00:03:14.299> they

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
far in as we're so far in the story they

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.640 
far in as we're so far in the story they
kind<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.780> made<00:03:14.930> us<00:03:15.049> forget<00:03:15.200> about<00:03:15.470> them

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
kind of made us forget about them

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.860 
kind of made us forget about them
and<00:03:17.890> probably<00:03:18.400> because<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:19.090> think<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.629> story

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and probably because I think this story

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.720 
and probably because I think this story
may<00:03:20.110> have<00:03:20.140> counted<00:03:20.680> out<00:03:20.829> mostly<00:03:21.220> somewhere

may have counted out mostly somewhere

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.520 
may have counted out mostly somewhere
