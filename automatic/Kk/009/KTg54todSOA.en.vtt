super fuel efficient initial readings
are<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.289> 25<00:00:58.920> percent<00:00:59.430> more<00:00:59.579> fuel<00:00:59.820> efficient

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
are about 25 percent more fuel efficient

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
are about 25 percent more fuel efficient
at<00:01:00.359> surf<00:01:00.539> speeds<00:01:00.960> than<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:02.070> previous<00:01:02.309> motor

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
at surf speeds than our previous motor

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
at surf speeds than our previous motor
so<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> fantastic<00:01:04.320> fantastic<00:01:04.890> motor

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so really a fantastic fantastic motor

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
so really a fantastic fantastic motor
that's<00:01:05.670> component<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.299> component<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
surf settings GPS speed control and an

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.170 
surf settings GPS speed control and an
industry-first<00:01:18.950> gyroscope<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
industry-first gyroscope right on the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
industry-first gyroscope right on the
touch<00:01:21.360> screen<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> gyroscope<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
touch screen so with the gyroscope you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.640 
touch screen so with the gyroscope you
can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.939> exactly<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.659> many<00:01:24.720> degrees<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.200> list

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
can see exactly how many degrees of list

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
can see exactly how many degrees of list
left<00:01:25.950> or<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> roll

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
left or right you have in in the roll

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
left or right you have in in the roll
and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.470> course<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> pitch<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> boat

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and then of course the pitch of the boat

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.940 
and then of course the pitch of the boat
as<00:01:29.640> well<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.960> boat<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.380> pitching

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
as well so if the boat is pitching

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.289 
as well so if the boat is pitching
forward<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.610> back<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> gives<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> an

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
forward or back and it gives you an

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
forward or back and it gives you an
exact<00:01:33.630> number<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.950> takes<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
exact number so it takes some of the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.069 
exact number so it takes some of the
voodoo<00:01:35.820> science<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> setting<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.869> your

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
voodoo science out of setting up your

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.499 
voodoo science out of setting up your
surf<00:01:37.799> boat<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:39.150> by<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> numbers

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
surf boat you can just go by the numbers

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
surf boat you can just go by the numbers
give<00:01:40.170> me<00:01:40.259> ten<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.650> two<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.159> we're<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> go

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
give me ten and two and we're good to go

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.179 
give me ten and two and we're good to go
so<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.049> set<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> boat<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.530> exactly<00:01:43.979> how

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
so you can set the boat up exactly how

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
so you can set the boat up exactly how
you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.990> third<00:01:46.229> component

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you want it that way the third component

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.030 
you want it that way the third component
of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.670> AVX<00:01:48.270> surf<00:01:48.479> system<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> the

of the AVX surf system is one of the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.179 
of the AVX surf system is one of the
coolest<00:01:50.399> things<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:52.189> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
coolest things going here we have the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
coolest things going here we have the
convex<00:01:54.060> VX<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.630> came<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> couple<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
convex VX which came out a couple of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.520 
convex VX which came out a couple of
years<00:01:55.590> ago<00:01:55.799> which<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> movable<00:01:58.200> item

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
