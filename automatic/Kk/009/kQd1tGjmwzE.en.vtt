00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 the first cream with which I want you 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 introduce this cream from the firm style 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.160
 crookedly multifunctional is strong any 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 for all skin types and how to write 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.540
 the manufacturer is so universal that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 you can even serve as a base for moisturizing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.460
 Easy to absorb for a luxurious vegan cream 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 that is, completely natural made 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.880
 manually from high quality 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 natural ingredients blended with 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.480
 help couples and you can actually 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.670
 notice it when you do it 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 such as hands and suddenly about something 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 wondered black sea and come back to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.610
 yourself you think i just wanted to deposit 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.039
 or am i already donetsk this cream so 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.170
 he lay down no trace 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.989
 soak in literally 15 seconds 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 as for the smell then its basically 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.970
 no, well, how do you have a smell but he 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.140
 smells like regular cream 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 that is, a cream without additives and at least some 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.689
 there is no aroma honored to use 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.210
 daily throughout the day on yourself in 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.920
 purse or leave it at work at 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 table because the jar is small 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.520
 quite succinctly and to not fit 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.990
 takes up a lot of space in your bag will go to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.759
 the plateau came to why I actually 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.509
 I wanted to buy this cream and that me 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.369
 attracted 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.780
 once wandering the internet I 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.030
 stumbled upon their sites and saw 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.310
 crazy number of multicolored 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 beautiful charming jars 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.150
 of this cream but now it is beginning 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 read the composition of that cream absolutely 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.130
 natural change and even more 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.470
 attracted 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.110
 and honestly returned on 15 stuck to 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.820
 choose my jar that i want cream 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.060
 he will not take it in all the same 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.340
 but also concerns on design there from you can 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 find flags you can find no animals 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.210
 abstract picture a bunch a bunch of everything im 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.070
 it wasn't interesting enough 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.899
 summing up I want to say that this 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.290
 cream in principle i would advise my 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.850
 familiar to those people who do not have something 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.170
 obvious some dryness 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.720
 who is she usually normal 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.860
 skin supplied thought four only from 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.590
 for the fact that this here is ease 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.600
 transparency and quick absorption 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.880
 robin confuses that moisturizer 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.770
 cream in my opinion should at least a little way 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.960
 stories to be thicker 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.840
 well this one seems to have taken the usual 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.230
 cream added this drop of water and such 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.450
 it turns very very easy what-ta 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.760
 texture by the way soon new year and 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.770
 so I think this cream can be 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.330
 A great alternative for the ordinary ones. 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.710
 set in which we give for example 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.320
 colleagues at work so be sure 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.450
 take a look and the next products with 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.570
 whom i want you to introduce this cream 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.020
 and scrub from Israeli brand secret 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.180
 cosmetics of the dead sea and then tell 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.830
 you about them in order in principle years what 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.750
 why so i use we all know what 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.610
 Dead Sea Contains Crazy 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.280
 the number of useful components such 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.700
 as a magician pulp iodine and other ingredients 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.490
 sea ​​water is used in cosmetics 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.660
 dead sea mud and minerals what I want 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.050
 say how oscar 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.390
 my first impression of him was quite 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.900
 unpleasant because I was very embarrassed 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.000
 the design itself and the contents of the jar as 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.090
 you can see the top oil and below 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 salt and all this needs to be mixed and on 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.010
 really not very comfortable is typing 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.290
 so far with this somehow here getting used to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.430
 using it mainly for but what 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.140
 As for the procedures it 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.460
 really cool because with 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.380
 alena grains 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.020
 very gentle gently exfoliates 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.870
 dry skin helps stimulate 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.370
 cell renewal 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.170
 do not scratch at the same time the skin 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.330
 oil residues nourish 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.460
 while the oil is not sticky at all 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.720
 leaves no trace behind 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.820
 you skin and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.860
 effect can be felt 1 1 but it 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.720
 so soft and that 's not the same thing 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.360
 higher after the sauna that is only 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.950
 steamed I do not know how it is very visible 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.560
 that the skin breathes after a while I 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.500
 found a cream with an incredible smell which 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.300
 just fell in love, he resembles a nursery 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.940
 I had a powder in my childhood and I remember 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.780
 powder with powder puff that smelled like that 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.579
 floral light scent 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.590
 To be honest there would be such a perfume, I even 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.330
 perfume bought with such a smell since i 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.290
 I like to use cream for the night 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.180
 fight fatter 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.770
 but it is not olive then it is great 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 time of course to say that this cream 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.639
 very quickly absorbed such as 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.280
 the first one is from sim krim but at the same time 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.880
 some discomfort and or what is there 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.460
 leave the dog filter traces or i 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.830
 going to bed or somehow uncomfortable with 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.810
 this is not very cool either 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.100
 the effect remains for a long time seems to me 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.380
 even more than twenty four hours 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.590
 because I use it every day and 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.800
 before applying I continue happiness 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.560
 how skin is soft and so here 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.900
 it remains very very fresh cosmetics not 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.340
 tested on animals and clinging to 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.710
 registration because it is important to us 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.360
 content I would put this couple 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.650
 the top five 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.560
 Well, the last thing with kimi I want you 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.650
 introduce this here is such a cream karite from 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.260
 l'oxitan for legs how much I would not go 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.650
 past this makeup, how many have I got here 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.389
 resisted without buying and and yet I 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.860
 I went in and bought somehow it was heard about 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.550
 the fact that they have a very cool cream 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.890
 for hands 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.110
 but such problems dry my hands 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.220
 never have been accordingly i think 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.220
 what did they buy there but was with me 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.110
 there was once an ordinary shower gel 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.000
 something more I did not expect problems from them 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.400
 with hands dry hands i don't have 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.169
 just dry my feet 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.490
 present so once i took this 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.890
 cream and so was shocked after 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.479
 the first application because it alone 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:51.850
 consistency cream insanely liquid 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.760
 loose we go how can such a cream 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.160
 to feed a pension is as cool as everyone writes 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.050
 if he is so liquid because I 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.419
 it seemed that for heels you need and without knowing 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.090
 some goose fat to soak up 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.210
 probably ready to advise in everything 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.979
 people of the planet and no one is wrong because 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.680

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.810
 honest i love him he always 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.900
 lying beside my bed on our 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.560

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.370
 quickly, well, I don’t know what cream like 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.380
 what cream in the heels is quickly absorbed 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.550

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.370
