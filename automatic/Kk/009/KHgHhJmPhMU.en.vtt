00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.700 
cheaper get this over with a boots on
TWC<00:01:22.500> copper<00:01:23.250> wire<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.000> cuz<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> don't<00:01:25.140> oh<00:01:25.380> no

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
TWC copper wire I cuz I don't oh no

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
TWC copper wire I cuz I don't oh no
copper<00:01:26.100> cables<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> thought<00:01:27.509> I'd<00:01:27.780> make

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
copper cables so I thought I'd make

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.560 
copper cables so I thought I'd make
myself<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.590> nice<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:29.220> quality<00:01:29.670> copper<00:01:30.150> cable

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
myself a nice good quality copper cable

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.069 
myself a nice good quality copper cable
so<00:01:31.670> that's<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.380> second<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.860> say<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.780> one

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
so that's it second is say this one

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.600 
so that's it second is say this one
makes<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.509> 3.5<00:01:42.509> millimeter<00:01:42.810> cable<00:01:43.619> okay<00:01:44.549> so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
makes the 3.5 millimeter cable okay so

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
makes the 3.5 millimeter cable okay so
let's<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.420> dessert<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.380> also<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.280> move

person okay I thought these were
actually<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.099> same<00:02:23.340> size<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> switch<00:02:24.239> cross

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629

which<00:02:24.900> are<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> much<00:02:25.439> larger<00:02:26.069> that's<00:02:26.310> why<00:02:26.459> I've

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
which are a much larger that's why I've

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.899 
which are a much larger that's why I've
never<00:02:27.079> considered<00:02:28.079> using<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:29.189> before<00:02:29.370> but

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
never considered using it before but

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.429 
never considered using it before but
they<00:02:30.780> are<00:02:31.260> actually<00:02:31.500> very<00:02:32.129> small<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:33.049> i<00:02:34.049> think

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
i will be using this check a lot from

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.319

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
these two cables understanding they

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.289 
these two cables understanding they
change<00:03:37.199> this<00:03:37.560> friend<00:03:38.010> come<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.699> there<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
change this friend come on there and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.530 
change this friend come on there and
they<00:03:39.989> also<00:03:40.199> change<00:03:40.979> how<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> strand<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:42.150> they

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
they also change how to strand is they

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.899 
they also change how to strand is they
that<00:03:42.840> including<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.919> dielectric<00:03:44.519> what<00:03:44.699> this

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
that including the dielectric what this

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.750 
that including the dielectric what this
trains<00:03:45.209> are<00:03:45.419> covered<00:03:45.780> with<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:46.169> war<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.340> let's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
trains are covered with is war so let's

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.270 
trains are covered with is war so let's
have<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:48.000> quick<00:03:48.269> look<00:03:48.299> at<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.069> let<00:03:50.069> me<00:03:50.129> just

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
have a quick look at that let me just

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.379 
have a quick look at that let me just

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
from each okay this the old cable and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.420 
from each okay this the old cable and
it's<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:02.909> new<00:04:03.150> one<00:04:03.419> I<00:04:03.629> kept<00:04:04.379> on<00:04:04.560> being<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:05.129> if

it's the new one I kept on being that if
i<00:04:05.639> look<00:04:05.849> at<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.829> next<00:04:07.829> to<00:04:08.099> each<00:04:08.189> other<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.579> two

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
i look at it next to each other are two

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.749 
i look at it next to each other are two
straight<00:04:09.000> way<00:04:09.180> see<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:10.709> old<00:04:10.949> cable<00:04:11.579> is

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
straight way see the old cable is

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.909 
straight way see the old cable is
actually<00:04:12.239> thicker<00:04:12.810> not<00:04:13.109> what<00:04:13.290> people<00:04:13.500> are<00:04:13.739> big

framing saying

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.640 
framing saying
cable<00:04:15.950> thicker<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.550> the<00:04:17.120> old<00:04:17.390> cable<00:04:17.959> actually

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650

is<00:04:18.950> thicker<00:04:20.019> okay<00:04:21.019> oh<00:04:21.200> so<00:04:21.769> on<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.070> inside<00:04:22.460> was

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
is thicker okay oh so on the inside was

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.880 
is thicker okay oh so on the inside was
on<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> old<00:04:23.330> one<00:04:23.630> they're<00:04:23.990> wise<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.680> made

on the old one they're wise and made

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.510 
on the old one they're wise and made
that<00:04:24.920> like<00:04:25.640> straight<00:04:26.270> okay<00:04:27.170> on<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.710> new<00:04:27.890> one<00:04:28.220> I

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
that like straight okay on the new one I

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.540 
that like straight okay on the new one I
can<00:04:28.700> see<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.090> wires<00:04:29.330> are<00:04:29.600> twisted<00:04:30.550> when

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
can see the wires are twisted when

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.430 
can see the wires are twisted when
they've<00:04:31.790> been<00:04:31.820> laid<00:04:32.180> out<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.660> just<00:04:32.870> twist

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
they've been laid out so I just twist

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.550 
they've been laid out so I just twist
them<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.890> sleeve<00:04:34.190> him<00:04:34.460> basically<00:04:35.140> so<00:04:36.140> does

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
them and sleeve him basically so does

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.830 
them and sleeve him basically so does
heart<00:04:36.770> donatus<00:04:37.400> try<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:37.940> count<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.390> each

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
heart donatus try and count on each

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.690 
heart donatus try and count on each
other<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.260> might<00:04:39.530> be<00:04:39.740> able<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.920> tell<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.430> that

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
out what each one how many strands each

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.290 
out what each one how many strands each
was<00:04:46.190> going<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.900> okay<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.010> that's<00:04:49.010> it<00:04:49.250> guys<00:04:49.300> the
