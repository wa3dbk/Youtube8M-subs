00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
wanted to give you guys a bit of a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.289 
wanted to give you guys a bit of a
snap-in<00:00:12.809> box<00:00:13.170> update<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:14.580> lot<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> new<00:00:15.180> features

snap-in box update a lot of new features

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.410 
snap-in box update a lot of new features
today<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:15.869> let's<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.650> started<00:00:17.100> first<00:00:17.940> off<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
today so let's get started first off the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630 
today so let's get started first off the
new<00:00:18.539> mist<00:00:18.779> peripherals<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.470> out<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.859> along

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
new mist peripherals is out and along

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.939 
new mist peripherals is out and along
with<00:00:20.669> all<00:00:21.000> its<00:00:21.150> new<00:00:21.300> features<00:00:21.689> these<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.619> snap

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
with all its new features these are snap

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.989 
with all its new features these are snap
and<00:00:23.220> boxes<00:00:23.759> new<00:00:23.939> features<00:00:24.890> yeah<00:00:25.970> they<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
and boxes new features yeah they just

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
and boxes new features yeah they just
sit<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:28.339> in<00:00:29.339> the<00:00:29.550> new<00:00:29.759> mist<00:00:30.509> peripherals

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
sit there in the new mist peripherals

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.960 
sit there in the new mist peripherals
chunk<00:00:31.560> loading<00:00:31.710> modules<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.880> bit

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
chunk loading modules got a little bit

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.479 
chunk loading modules got a little bit
of<00:00:33.060> a<00:00:33.120> nerf<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:34.050> no<00:00:34.260> longer<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.890> wireless

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
of a nerf they no longer have wireless

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.940 
of a nerf they no longer have wireless
modules<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> since<00:00:37.260> snap<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> box

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
modules in them and since snap and box

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.550 
modules in them and since snap and box
communicated<00:00:38.580> wirelessly<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
communicated wirelessly that was a

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.210 
communicated wirelessly that was a
little<00:00:40.740> bit<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> problem<00:00:42.980> luckily<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> found

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
little bit of a problem luckily I found

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.400 
little bit of a problem luckily I found
a<00:00:44.340> workaround<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:45.240> gonna<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:45.780> redstone

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
a workaround I'm gonna use redstone

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.120 
a workaround I'm gonna use redstone
signal<00:00:46.680> strength<00:00:47.130> now<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.440> box<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:49.740> put<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
signal strength now so box will put a

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.980 
signal strength now so box will put a
certain<00:00:50.400> signal<00:00:50.850> strength<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.330> behind<00:00:51.750> him

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
certain signal strength out behind him

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.080 
certain signal strength out behind him
snap<00:00:52.560> can<00:00:52.860> read<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.640> front<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.970> him

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
snap can read that from in front of him

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.230 
snap can read that from in front of him
and<00:00:54.530> interpret<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.980> signal<00:00:56.580> means<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
and interpret what that signal means and

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.440 
and interpret what that signal means and
snap<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.110> send<00:00:58.350> his<00:00:58.500> signal<00:00:58.890> back<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.070> box<00:00:59.450> it

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
snap can send his signal back to box it

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.870 
snap can send his signal back to box it
works<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> same<00:01:01.140> principle<00:01:01.740> as<00:01:02.040> redstone

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
works on the same principle as redstone

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.899 
works on the same principle as redstone
signal<00:01:03.300> strength<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.159> 15<00:01:05.610> because

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
signal strength so this is 15 because

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.249 
signal strength so this is 15 because
it's<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.150> next<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> torch<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.049> see

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
it's right next to the torch you can see

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.349 
it's right next to the torch you can see
it's<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.530> bright<00:01:07.830> red<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.999> as<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:09.359 
it's really bright red and then as you

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.569 
it's really bright red and then as you
get<00:01:09.479> further<00:01:09.689> from<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.109> torch<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> zero

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
get further from the torch this is zero

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.190 
get further from the torch this is zero
you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.329> just<00:01:12.539> black<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.810> no

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
you can see it's just black and no

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.340 
you can see it's just black and no
longer<00:01:13.439> glowing<00:01:14.009> so<00:01:14.670> each<00:01:15.570> signal<00:01:16.079> strength

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
longer glowing so each signal strength

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.260 
longer glowing so each signal strength
has<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> different<00:01:16.920> meaning<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.640> depending<00:01:18.179> on

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
has a different meaning and depending on

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.480 
has a different meaning and depending on
the<00:01:18.390> strength<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.899> box<00:01:19.109> receives<00:01:19.590> he'll<00:01:20.249> run

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the strength that box receives he'll run

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.819 
the strength that box receives he'll run
a<00:01:20.520> different<00:01:20.729> program<00:01:22.999> next<00:01:23.999> new<00:01:24.240> feature<00:01:24.829> one

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
a different program next new feature one

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.319 
a different program next new feature one
of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> requested<00:01:26.579> features<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
of the requested features was a

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.120 
of the requested features was a
launching<00:01:27.840> program<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.740> could<00:01:28.950> use

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
launching program so that you could use

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
launching program so that you could use
the<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:29.429> program<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.270> both<00:01:30.539> snap<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.140> box

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the same program for both snap and box

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.260 
the same program for both snap and box
and<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.399> I<00:01:32.429> wanted<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> show<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and so I wanted to show that off a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.319 
and so I wanted to show that off a
little<00:01:33.389> bit<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.100> paste<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:35.789> paste

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
little bit I just paste it in some paste

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.209 
little bit I just paste it in some paste
bin<00:01:36.539> code<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.139> this<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.679> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> video

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
bin code here this will be in the video

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.129 
bin code here this will be in the video
description<00:01:38.369> again<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.539> need<00:01:39.719> it<00:01:39.869> then

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:40.139 
description again so if you need it then

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.410 
description again so if you need it then
just<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:40.560> ahead<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> copy<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.310> there

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just go ahead and copy it from there

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.870 
just go ahead and copy it from there
I<00:01:42.450> recommend<00:01:43.350> calling<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.950> startup<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.819> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I recommend calling it startup for a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.190 
I recommend calling it startup for a
feature<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> I'll<00:01:45.719> talk<00:01:45.899> about<00:01:45.929> a<00:01:46.139> little

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
feature that I'll talk about a little

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.569 
feature that I'll talk about a little
later<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.289> you<00:01:49.289> know<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.499> just<00:01:49.709> run<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> or

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
later so you know you just run it or

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.129 
later so you know you just run it or
it'll<00:01:50.819> run<00:01:50.999> automatically<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.600> reboot<00:01:51.929> and

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
it'll run automatically on reboot and

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.629 
it'll run automatically on reboot and
the<00:01:52.499> first<00:01:52.679> thing<00:01:52.829> they'll<00:01:52.950> ask<00:01:53.069> if<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.459> wish

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
the first thing they'll ask if you wish

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.059 
the first thing they'll ask if you wish
to<00:01:53.670> achieve<00:01:53.850> automatic<00:01:54.569> updates<00:01:55.069> the

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
to achieve automatic updates the

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.849 
to achieve automatic updates the
launcher<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.729> update<00:01:56.880> itself<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.869> snap<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
launcher can update itself and snap and

something you know you never know I try
to<00:02:08.340> put<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.640> code<00:02:08.850> without<00:02:09.090> bugs<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.720> no

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to put out code without bugs but no

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.979 
to put out code without bugs but no
promises<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.629> want<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.840> take

if you wanted to turn them off you could
from<00:02:25.260> there<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.489> then<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.910> beta<00:02:27.120> code

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
from there and then this is beta code

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.080 
from there and then this is beta code
remember<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> may<00:02:28.050> break<00:02:28.230> unexpectedly<00:02:29.090> so

away 3 by 3 3 &amp; 3 now it says waiting
for<00:03:09.269> snap<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.110> let's<00:03:10.290> go<00:03:10.410> over<00:03:10.500> snap<00:03:10.799> we'll<00:03:11.459> run

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
for snap so let's go over snap we'll run

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.470 
for snap so let's go over snap we'll run
the<00:03:11.730> same<00:03:11.940> launcher<00:03:13.459> receive<00:03:14.459> updates<00:03:14.879> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
box is now between the mining well and

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.069 
box is now between the mining well and
the<00:03:30.389> enderchest

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
the enderchest

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.229 
the enderchest
this<00:03:31.799> is<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> next<00:03:32.489> new<00:03:32.700> feature<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.060> I

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
this is for the next new feature that I

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.190 
this is for the next new feature that I
wanted<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.540> show<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.750> guys<00:03:34.049> which<00:03:34.920> is

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
wanted to show you guys which is

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.440 
wanted to show you guys which is
overflow<00:03:37.200> protection<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.880> before<00:03:39.420> I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
overflow protection you know before I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.300 
overflow protection you know before I
had<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.810> ender<00:03:40.019> chest<00:03:40.290> right<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.620> top<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
had the ender chest right on top of the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.129 
had the ender chest right on top of the
mining<00:03:41.639> well<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.329> if<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.599> ender<00:03:42.780> chest<00:03:42.989> was

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
mining well so if the ender chest was

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.569 
mining well so if the ender chest was
full<00:03:43.380> then<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> mining<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:44.160> would<00:03:44.370> just

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
full then the mining well would just

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.400 
full then the mining well would just
spew<00:03:45.000> entities<00:03:45.389> out<00:03:45.569> in<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> world<00:03:46.019> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
spew entities out in the world and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.479 
spew entities out in the world and
everyone<00:03:47.370> hates<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:48.139> now<00:03:49.139> box<00:03:49.829> acts<00:03:50.190> as<00:03:50.459> a

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
everyone hates you now box acts as a

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.879 
everyone hates you now box acts as a
buffer<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.599> for<00:03:51.900> example<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.380> open<00:03:52.709> him<00:03:52.859> up

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
buffer so for example if I open him up

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.250 
buffer so for example if I open him up
oh<00:03:53.250> he's<00:03:53.910> got<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.150> piece<00:03:54.389> of<00:03:54.510> dirt<00:03:54.690> here<00:03:55.079> and

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
oh he's got this piece of dirt here and

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.449 
oh he's got this piece of dirt here and
he's<00:03:55.530> trying<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.829> put<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.099> in<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.250> ender

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
he's trying to put that in the ender

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.520 
he's trying to put that in the ender
chest<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.269> ender<00:03:57.930> chest<00:03:58.139> is<00:03:58.260> full<00:03:58.410> of

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
chest but the ender chest is full of

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.970 
chest but the ender chest is full of
iridium<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.730> won't<00:03:59.910> fit<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.389> dirt<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
iridium so it won't fit the dirt you

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.099 
iridium so it won't fit the dirt you
know<00:04:02.069> if<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.280> take<00:04:02.489> some<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.359> sandstone<00:04:03.870> out

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
know if I take some of the sandstone out

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.970 
know if I take some of the sandstone out
then<00:04:04.560> he<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:04.769> put<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:04.919> dirt<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:06.889> then<00:04:07.889> he

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
then he can put the dirt in and then he

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.309 
then he can put the dirt in and then he
can<00:04:08.130> continue<00:04:08.459> on<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.269> now<00:04:09.480> if<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:09.780> example

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
can continue on so now if for example

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.440 
can continue on so now if for example
this<00:04:10.530> chunk<00:04:10.889> over<00:04:11.250> here<00:04:11.579> gets<00:04:11.760> unloaded<00:04:12.329> with

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
this chunk over here gets unloaded with

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.110 
this chunk over here gets unloaded with
your<00:04:12.630> ME<00:04:12.810> system<00:04:13.319> or<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:14.130> you're<00:04:14.639> me<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.060> you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
your ME system or if you're me and you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.520 
your ME system or if you're me and you
didn't<00:04:15.359> put<00:04:15.480> an<00:04:15.569> ender<00:04:15.780> chest<00:04:15.989> down<00:04:16.139> for<00:04:16.410> some

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
didn't put an ender chest down for some

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.120 
didn't put an ender chest down for some
reason<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:19.500> know<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.650> won't<00:04:19.919> be

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
reason then you know you won't be

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.370 
reason then you know you won't be
putting<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.849> T's<00:04:20.970> into<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.329> world<00:04:21.510> box

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
putting it to T's into the world box

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.050 
putting it to T's into the world box
he'll<00:04:22.560> just<00:04:22.740> sit<00:04:23.010> there<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.250> wait<00:04:23.460> until<00:04:23.880> he

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
he'll just sit there and wait until he

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.490 
he'll just sit there and wait until he
can<00:04:24.210> fill<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.570> chest<00:04:24.780> again<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.110> then<00:04:25.320> move

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
can fill the chest again and then move

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.930 
can fill the chest again and then move
on<00:04:26.930> this<00:04:27.930> also<00:04:28.140> works<00:04:28.440> well<00:04:28.650> because<00:04:28.890> snap<00:04:29.700> and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
on this also works well because snap and

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.970 
on this also works well because snap and
box<00:04:30.120> need<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.479> be<00:04:30.570> right<00:04:30.780> next<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.080> each<00:04:31.140> other

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
box need to be right next to each other

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.100 
box need to be right next to each other
with<00:04:32.250> redstone<00:04:32.580> anyway<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:33.810> kind<00:04:34.080> of

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
with redstone anyway so it's kind of

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
with redstone anyway so it's kind of
like<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.260> dual<00:04:34.470> feature<00:04:34.740> set<00:04:35.070> here<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:38.000> next

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
like a dual feature set here the next

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.230 
like a dual feature set here the next
thing<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.510> wanted<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.780> show<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.020> guys<00:04:40.230> is

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
thing I wanted to show you guys is

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.870 
thing I wanted to show you guys is
resuming<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:43.020> for<00:04:43.290> example<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:44.070> quit<00:04:44.760> the

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
resuming so for example if I quit the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.250 
resuming so for example if I quit the
game<00:04:45.030> right<00:04:45.240> now<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:47.280> go<00:04:47.460> back<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.700> my<00:04:47.970> world

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.840 

and<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.470> open<00:04:52.860> one<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.100> them<00:04:53.220> you'll<00:04:53.490> notice<00:04:53.730> it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
and I open one of them you'll notice it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.610 
and I open one of them you'll notice it
says<00:04:54.030> resuming<00:04:54.510> in<00:04:54.600> five<00:04:54.750> seconds<00:04:55.170> press<00:04:55.410> any

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
says resuming in five seconds press any

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.740 
says resuming in five seconds press any
key<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.950> stop<00:04:56.130> resumed<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:57.360> actually<00:04:57.660> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
key to stop resumed it's actually the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.510 
key to stop resumed it's actually the
Enter<00:04:58.050> key<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.380> have<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.560> press<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:59.070> think<00:04:59.100> I

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
Enter key you have to press I think I

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.560 
Enter key you have to press I think I
messed<00:05:00.060> that<00:05:00.210> up<00:05:00.270> but<00:05:00.920> I'll<00:05:01.920> change<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:03.150> and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
messed that up but I'll change it so and

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.610 
messed that up but I'll change it so and
then<00:05:03.660> they<00:05:03.840> pick<00:05:03.990> up<00:05:04.140> right<00:05:04.320> where<00:05:04.350> they<00:05:04.500> left

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
then they pick up right where they left

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.520 
then they pick up right where they left
off<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:05.880> can<00:05:06.150> see<00:05:06.360> they<00:05:06.540> wake<00:05:06.690> up<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:07.200> then

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
off so you can see they wake up and then

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.160 
off so you can see they wake up and then
they<00:05:07.710> just<00:05:07.890> continue<00:05:08.400> on<00:05:08.930> doing<00:05:09.930> what<00:05:10.080> they

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
they just continue on doing what they

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.250 
they just continue on doing what they
were<00:05:10.230> doing<00:05:11.030> I've<00:05:12.030> tested<00:05:12.540> this<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:12.720> bunch<00:05:13.110> of

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
were doing I've tested this a bunch of

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.880 
were doing I've tested this a bunch of
times<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:14.510> they<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.900> think<00:05:16.230> I<00:05:16.350> got<00:05:16.530> all<00:05:16.740> the

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
times and they I think I got all the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.440 
times and they I think I got all the
states<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.280> they<00:05:17.520> could<00:05:17.670> possibly<00:05:18.030> be<00:05:18.270> in

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
states that they could possibly be in

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.910 
states that they could possibly be in
for<00:05:19.170> this<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.530> you<00:05:20.010> know<00:05:20.130> break<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.210> hopefully

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
for this to you know break so hopefully

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.560 
for this to you know break so hopefully
you<00:05:22.920> know<00:05:22.950> if<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.280> messes<00:05:23.430> up<00:05:23.610> on<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.240> you

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
you know if it messes up on you and you

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.780 
you know if it messes up on you and you
can<00:05:24.720> reproduce<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.320> bug<00:05:25.470> then<00:05:26.070> please<00:05:26.550> let<00:05:26.730> me

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
can reproduce the bug then please let me

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.990 
can reproduce the bug then please let me
know<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.480> way<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.660> can<00:05:28.020> get<00:05:28.110> it<00:05:28.260> fixed<00:05:29.000> they

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
know that way I can get it fixed they

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.460 
know that way I can get it fixed they
take<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> little<00:05:30.390> while<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.630> turn<00:05:30.930> on<00:05:31.110> they<00:05:31.350> take

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
take a little while to turn on they take

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.920 
take a little while to turn on they take
about<00:05:31.590> 15<00:05:32.310> seconds<00:05:32.670> or<00:05:32.790> so<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.030> get<00:05:33.540> back<00:05:33.750> in

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
about 15 seconds or so to get back in

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.130 
about 15 seconds or so to get back in
their<00:05:34.080> rhythm<00:05:36.230> so<00:05:38.210> finally<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.570> last<00:05:39.600> thing<00:05:40.020> I

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
their rhythm so finally the last thing I

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.090 
their rhythm so finally the last thing I
added<00:05:40.320> was<00:05:41.930> turtles<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:43.020> don't<00:05:43.410> need<00:05:43.620> fuel

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
added was turtles that don't need fuel

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.130 
added was turtles that don't need fuel
so<00:05:44.670> if<00:05:44.820> you<00:05:44.940> have<00:05:45.090> fuel<00:05:45.360> turned<00:05:45.630> off<00:05:45.840> in<00:05:46.020> your

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
so if you have fuel turned off in your

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.370 
so if you have fuel turned off in your
world<00:05:46.350> then<00:05:47.300> snap<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.480> box<00:05:48.630> should<00:05:48.840> work<00:05:49.080> fine

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
world then snap and box should work fine

world then snap and box should work fine
and<00:05:49.800> now<00:05:50.550> they<00:05:50.730> shouldn't<00:05:50.940> ask<00:05:51.150> for<00:05:51.300> a

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420

and now they shouldn't ask for a
charging<00:05:51.840> station<00:05:51.960> anymore<00:05:52.500> cuz<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:52.890> guess<00:05:53.070> it

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
charging station anymore cuz I guess it

would ask for a charging station and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.240 
would ask for a charging station and
