 good so today I show you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.490
 how to win at 4.1 million more 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.490
 distant 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.930
 so he gives him first of all 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 troops and a car 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.200
 too bad one of the brought her garage 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.500
 so that his city â€‹â€‹ensures to pose a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500
 beautiful life here 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.679
 8 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.059
 you just have to go to the early launch 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:51.530
 this custom to improve the car 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.530
 costs as much as possible for resale 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.519
 and after also according to the levels and in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.750
 the other car will cost more or less 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.710
 dear because you've unlocked 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 some things at that level 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.780
 So you're ready either 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 shielding everything you can 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.720
 does he report the most on the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 car is the engine 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.730
 suspensions the transmission and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.540
 the turbo then you can also 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.310
 put the suspension we could all m 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.290
 all will bring you back except some stuff 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 that I would not have what to say to you I 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.190
 know some stuff that is reports that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.710
 slab then you have to come out for 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.970
 that it does for her to record the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.890
 changes made us on your 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 car otherwise it does not work that you 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.590
 kidnappings to enter 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.690
 and there is more to sell start 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.610
 online changes players pretty quickly 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.610
 shows good 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.970
 and quite quickly the start online 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.770
 change pasture 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.150
 this is for info there is no need to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.550
 do it super fast 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.770
 it's frankly easy 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.450
 no real risk of losing your car 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.490
 it's a really simple pitch all the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.640
 world can do it there is nothing to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.640
 to fear 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.970
 then you take your character and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.970
 you leave 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.579
 so here I am with 250 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.520
 miles at the start I only had the 140 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.310
 horses 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.020
 for this purpose thomas malthus 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.310
 but what's his locker 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.599
 it's cool and that it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.720
 the village is more than to enter 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.120
 my garage my car is still there I 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.580
 learn everywhere like this custom and I 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.580
 the resale and that kind of empty 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.640
 so here I am against you 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.840
 strongly advises against 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.160
 leach too often not 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 a dog you buy all the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.400
 Car 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.520
 everything is after there is no interest anymore at 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.520
 game so it's a little stupid to you 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.700
 I was yours to see 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.700
 it
