00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.236
 Greetings. 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.818
 If you want to try something new… 

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:09.242
 If you dream about becoming famous… 

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.478
 If you are not afraid to challenge yourself or others ... 

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.370
 Try a new way for Team battles: 

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:16.624
 Ranking! 

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:18.090
 Create your own team. 

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:19.240
 Play together. 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.066
 Succeed and earn unique honors, extra credits and ranking points. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.138
 Every win brings you one step closer to the top of the Ranking! 

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:32.385
 Build your own team and embark on a journey to glory. 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.344
 Just click the button. 

00:00:34.507 --> 00:00:35.570
 Then send invitations. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.895
 The maximum number of players in a team is 12, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.318
 but 7 members are enough to play the ranked battles. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.618
 Each member can be promoted to the rank of officer by the team leader. 

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:50.671
 Officers can send a team to battle. 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.447
 After the team is complete 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.445
 and all members have confirmed that they are ready to start, 

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:57.627
 commander presses "Battle!" 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.286
 and a special sort of battle searches the opponent with the same strength. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.565
 Once a suitable opponent is found, you are redirected to the Force Distribution screen. 

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.006
 Here you can see the map for the upcoming battle 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.858
 and also the points where team member tanks appear. 

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.068
 With this information in mind 

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.935
 every team member can change the vehicle. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.896
 But time is limited. 

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:19.774
 If all players have confirmed that they are ready, 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.071
 they enter battle with the vehicle they chose. 

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:26.490
 If a player doesn't choose a vehicle, 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.277
 he enters the whole team into battle in the originally selected vehicles. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.795
 If your team is complete, but you want to play a normal battle without rating, 

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.852
 you can press the "Unrated Battle" button. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.215
 Of course, of course, you can go back to playing rated battles. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.330
 If there are fewer than 7 players in the team, 

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:49.571
 it can only participate in unrated battles. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.706
 In unrated battles 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.329
 you can always ask legionaries to fill in your team's vacancies. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.593
 It is also a good way to find players 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.731
 who can later be recruited into your permanent team 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.554
 A Legionary is any player who is not a member of the Leaderboard Team 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.034
 but he plays for this team in unrated battles. 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.307
 Every legionary can find a team and expand his ranks. 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.809
 To do so, enter Ranked Battles mode. 

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.331
 In the team list 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.087
 you can only find teams looking for other players. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.260
 Each player can find a team of their own and ask for entry. 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.030
 Remember that you can only apply for one team at a time. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.675
 So if you have applied to another team and found a better choice, 

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:32.467
 you must cancel the first request before sending a new one. 

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.699
 Each team has its own page that includes detailed statistics. 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.330
 Here you can find the team's position in the Leaderboard, 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.360
 the vehicles with which it plays best 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.770
 and maps most often wins. 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.823
 You can also view the personal statistics of each player. 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.138
 You can see teams that are in the same Division. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.525
 On the statistics page 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.872
 You can also see team successes in each season. 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.558
 Ranked battles will be divided into seasons. 

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:03.916
 At the end of each season 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.512
 all participants receive a unique award. 

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:11.397
 At the beginning of the second season there will be even more rewards: 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.242
 The best-ranked teams qualify for the Wargaming.net League. 

00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:21.427
 Put your team together and fight for a place on the top of the Ranking!
