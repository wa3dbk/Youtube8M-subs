00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
of a hook anyway

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.789 
of a hook anyway
pull<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:55.040> right<00:01:56.090> through<00:01:57.090> see<00:01:57.750> how<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.469> did

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
pull that right through see how I did

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.319 
pull that right through see how I did
that<00:01:59.070> the<00:02:00.030> tail<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:02.189> hook<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.000> roots

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that the tail just is my hook the roots

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.410 
that the tail just is my hook the roots
so<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> succulents<00:02:04.320> will<00:02:05.100> grow<00:02:05.520> right

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
so the succulents will grow right

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.789 
so the succulents will grow right

through the glue I'm going to use them

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.850 
through the glue I'm going to use them

of a tail to hold them in place
you<00:02:17.560> can<00:02:17.710> even<00:02:17.890> use<00:02:18.480> different<00:02:19.480> types<00:02:20.170> of

over time and a lot of succulents do and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.940 
over time and a lot of succulents do and
I<00:02:41.710> want<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.010> really<00:02:42.370> glop<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.210> glue<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.950> this

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I want to really glop the glue on this

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.199 
I want to really glop the glue on this
rosette

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
rosette

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.270 
rosette
I've<00:02:46.780> even<00:02:46.900> got<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.320> on<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> leaves<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
I've even got it on the leaves that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:59.900 
I've even got it on the leaves that
ought<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.730> help<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.120> stick

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.450 

I<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.410> amidst<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.780> topiary<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.460> hydrate

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
I like to amidst the topiary to hydrate

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.180 
I like to amidst the topiary to hydrate
the<00:03:06.000> leaves<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.460> last<00:03:08.700> step<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:10.190> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
the leaves and so the last step is to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.320 
the leaves and so the last step is to
trim<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.570> tail<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:14.220> there<00:03:14.640> we<00:03:14.760> have<00:03:14.940> it

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
trim the tail and there we have it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.420 
trim the tail and there we have it
there<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.990> our<00:03:16.140> finished<00:03:17.810> semper<00:03:18.810> bibim

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
there is our finished semper bibim

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:31.230 
there is our finished semper bibim
topiary

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240
