especially if they're not glued in some

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
especially if they're not glued in some
can<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.610> make<00:01:47.820> their<00:01:48.210> way<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.810> there

can actually make their way up in there

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
can actually make their way up in there
it<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> painful<00:01:50.420> look<00:01:51.420> right<00:01:51.659> now

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it can be kind of painful look right now

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.490 
it can be kind of painful look right now
I<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:53.780> somewhere<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I have one somewhere down in there I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.320 
I have one somewhere down in there I
don't<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.610> but

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
don't know but

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.410 
don't know but
with<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.380> glass<00:01:59.950> of<00:01:59.980> drink<00:02:00.640> or<00:02:00.850> something<00:02:01.330> I

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
with a glass of drink or something I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.150 
with a glass of drink or something I
mean<00:02:01.570> it'd<00:02:01.750> be<00:02:01.930> easy<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.380> wash<00:02:02.590> all<00:02:02.830> those<00:02:02.980> old

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
mean it'd be easy to wash all those old

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.750 
mean it'd be easy to wash all those old
particles<00:02:03.910> out<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:05.140> could<00:02:05.320> eat<00:02:05.920> crunchy

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
particles out and you could eat crunchy

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.420 
particles out and you could eat crunchy
corn<00:02:07.270> nuts<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.440> thought<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.160> would

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
corn nuts so I thought that that would

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.850 
corn nuts so I thought that that would
be<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:10.119> little<00:02:10.570> bit<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.840> motivation<00:02:11.590> for

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
be like a little bit of motivation for

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.380 
be like a little bit of motivation for
those<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.430> who<00:02:12.640> are<00:02:12.700> just<00:02:12.910> starting<00:02:13.000> out

that<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.580> don't<00:03:00.820> rely<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.390> heavily<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.960> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
that I don't rely so heavily on the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.229 
that I don't rely so heavily on the
adhesive<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:03.100> eat<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:03.850> that's<00:03:04.030> what<00:03:04.180> I

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
adhesive to eat because that's what I

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.030 
adhesive to eat because that's what I
was<00:03:04.360> doing<00:03:04.660> at<00:03:04.780> first<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.290> would<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.739> eat

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
was doing at first I would not eat

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.890 
was doing at first I would not eat
unless<00:03:06.370> my<00:03:06.670> teeth<00:03:06.880> were<00:03:07.060> glued<00:03:07.360> down<00:03:07.630> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
unless my teeth were glued down and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300 
unless my teeth were glued down and
there<00:03:07.989> was<00:03:08.110> no<00:03:08.350> chance<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.860> them<00:03:09.040> moving

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
there was no chance of them moving

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.030 
there was no chance of them moving
around<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.810> he<00:03:11.020> said<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:11.890> would<00:03:11.980> be

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
around but he said that it would be

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.400 
around but he said that it would be
better<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:13.150> when<00:03:13.390> you're<00:03:13.540> at<00:03:13.660> home<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.230> you
