power management mode to say prefer
maximum<00:01:09.670> performance<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.710> as<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.609> did

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
maximum performance but as you did

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.609 
maximum performance but as you did
already<00:01:12.969> in<00:01:13.179> the<00:01:13.329> global<00:01:13.990> settings<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.439> should

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
already in the global settings it should

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.129 
already in the global settings it should
already<00:01:14.859> work<00:01:15.189> so<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:16.359> if<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.569> doesn't<00:01:16.749> just

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
already work so but if it doesn't just

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.529 
already work so but if it doesn't just
just<00:01:17.439> try<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:17.770> do<00:01:17.889> that<00:01:18.069> same<00:01:18.969> with<00:01:19.149> vertical

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
just try and do that same with vertical

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.010 
just try and do that same with vertical

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.940 
install I mean to fix this error I've
tried<00:01:46.779> loads<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.229> different<00:01:47.350> things<00:01:47.740> I've

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
tried loads of different things I've

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.279 
tried loads of different things I've
tried<00:01:48.159> reinstalling<00:01:49.090> Windows<00:01:50.219> I've<00:01:51.219> tried

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
tried reinstalling Windows I've tried

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.199 
tried reinstalling Windows I've tried
like<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.590> lot<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.100> things<00:01:54.279> reverting<00:01:54.819> back<00:01:54.850> to

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
like a lot of things reverting back to

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.599 
like a lot of things reverting back to
old<00:01:55.389> drivers<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.469> just<00:01:56.799> didn't<00:01:57.130> work<00:01:57.310> out

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
old drivers that just didn't work out

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.999 
old drivers that just didn't work out
and<00:01:57.939> this<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.599> most<00:01:58.810> simple<00:01:59.229> solution<00:01:59.770> and

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
and this is the most simple solution and

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.580 
and this is the most simple solution and
if<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.249> doesn't<00:02:00.549> work<00:02:00.700> then<00:02:01.689> there<00:02:02.409> might<00:02:02.529> be

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
if it doesn't work then there might be

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.279 
if it doesn't work then there might be
some<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:03.189> little<00:02:03.340> problem<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:04.299> might<00:02:04.509> not<00:02:04.929> be

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
some a little problem it might not be

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.060 
some a little problem it might not be
your<00:02:05.499> video<00:02:05.679> card<00:02:06.189> that's<00:02:06.399> causing<00:02:06.939> it<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:08.070> you
