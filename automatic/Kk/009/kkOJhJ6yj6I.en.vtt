00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
everything that she is doing so I think

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.899 
everything that she is doing so I think
that<00:01:28.320> O'Malley<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> sincere<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> he

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that O'Malley is sincere in that he

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.770 
that O'Malley is sincere in that he
wants<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> give<00:01:30.960> her<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.439> debate<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
wants to give her a debate I think that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
wants to give her a debate I think that
it<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.170> difficult<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.829> him<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> actually

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it will be difficult for him to actually

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.280 
it will be difficult for him to actually
execute<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.909> debate<00:01:36.180> okay<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> Amos<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
execute that debate okay and Amos of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
think that there's sort of just a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.270 
think that there's sort of just a
natural<00:03:03.030> hesitation<00:03:03.890> given<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> fact<00:03:05.160> that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
natural hesitation given the fact that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
natural hesitation given the fact that

it's april 2015 we're still a year and a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.950 
it's april 2015 we're still a year and a
half<00:03:07.530> out<00:03:07.980> i<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:08.910> natural<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.750> normal

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
I think this actually helps Rubio

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.710 
I think this actually helps Rubio
because<00:04:08.910> there's<00:04:09.209> going<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.480> lot<00:04:09.660> of

because there's going to be a lot of

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.199 
because there's going to be a lot of
media<00:04:09.959> coverage<00:04:10.200> over<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.620> next<00:04:10.890> 24<00:04:11.340> 36<00:04:11.730> 48

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.930 
husbands were president we hear a lot
about<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.470> Clinton<00:04:28.770> dynasty<00:04:29.129> the<00:04:29.550> bush<00:04:29.699> on<00:04:29.849> to

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
about the Clinton dynasty the bush on to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.570 
about the Clinton dynasty the bush on to
see<00:04:30.090> if<00:04:30.120> Jeb<00:04:30.930> runs<00:04:31.110> again<00:04:31.349> ruba<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.340> little

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
see if Jeb runs again ruba is a little

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.550 
see if Jeb runs again ruba is a little
bit<00:04:32.669> different<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.210> he<00:04:33.569> is<00:04:33.780> younger<00:04:34.349> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
bit different in that he is younger I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.980 
bit different in that he is younger I
mean<00:04:34.710> he's<00:04:35.150> he<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.300> different<00:04:36.509> candidate

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
mean he's he is a different candidate

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.629 
mean he's he is a different candidate
right<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.560> think<00:04:37.860> that's<00:04:37.919> what<00:04:38.129> he<00:04:38.220> has<00:04:38.430> going

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
right I think that's what he has going

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.850 
right I think that's what he has going
for<00:04:38.789> him<00:04:39.090> is<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.389> he<00:04:39.569> still<00:04:39.870> seems<00:04:40.199> fresh

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
for him is that he still seems fresh

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.730 
for him is that he still seems fresh
he's<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.610> younger<00:04:42.259> he<00:04:43.259> doesn't

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
he's a little younger he doesn't

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.309 
he's a little younger he doesn't
necessarily<00:04:44.090> subscribe<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.539> Republican

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
necessarily subscribe to Republican

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.710 
necessarily subscribe to Republican
orthodoxy<00:04:47.129> on<00:04:47.310> every<00:04:47.669> issue<00:04:47.699> but<00:04:48.449> he's<00:04:48.599> also

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
orthodoxy on every issue but he's also

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.839 
orthodoxy on every issue but he's also
gotten<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.110> trouble<00:04:49.289> for<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.680> certainly<00:04:50.460> you

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
gotten in trouble for that certainly you

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.110 
gotten in trouble for that certainly you
know<00:04:50.879> an<00:04:51.000> information<00:04:51.569> on<00:04:51.780> immigration<00:04:52.440> etc

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
know an information on immigration etc

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.309 
know an information on immigration etc
and<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.270> think<00:04:54.539> it<00:04:54.629> would<00:04:54.750> be<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.900> little<00:04:55.110> bit

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
and I think it would be a little bit

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.610 
and I think it would be a little bit
disingenuous<00:04:55.530> for<00:04:56.690> Republicans<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.780> embrace

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
disingenuous for Republicans to embrace

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.159 
disingenuous for Republicans to embrace
him<00:04:58.860> given<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.400> he<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.849> young<00:05:00.659> and<00:05:00.690> youthful

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
him given that he is young and youthful

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.110 
him given that he is young and youthful
and<00:05:01.530> somewhat<00:05:01.830> inexperienced<00:05:02.069> given<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
and somewhat inexperienced given the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.339 
and somewhat inexperienced given the
charges<00:05:03.569> that<00:05:03.599> they've<00:05:03.780> levied<00:05:04.020> against

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
charges that they've levied against

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.950 
charges that they've levied against
Barack<00:05:04.560> Obama<00:05:04.860> for<00:05:05.069> the<00:05:05.159> last<00:05:05.340> eight<00:05:05.580> years<00:05:05.960> so

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
Barack Obama for the last eight years so

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.950 
Barack Obama for the last eight years so
I<00:05:07.229> tend<00:05:08.009> to<00:05:08.159> think<00:05:08.250> just<00:05:08.819> again<00:05:09.599> given<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
I tend to think just again given the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.620 
I tend to think just again given the
fact<00:05:10.319> that<00:05:10.500> he<00:05:11.310> hasn't<00:05:11.520> been<00:05:11.789> much<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.240> part<00:05:12.509> of

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
fact that he hasn't been much a part of

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.990 
fact that he hasn't been much a part of
the<00:05:12.750> conversation<00:05:13.110> even<00:05:13.770> up<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.370> this<00:05:14.639> point

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
the conversation even up to this point

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.379 
the conversation even up to this point
talking<00:05:15.690> about<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.080> 2016<00:05:16.740> races<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:18.120> Hillary

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
talking about the 2016 races the Hillary

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.899 
talking about the 2016 races the Hillary
Clinton<00:05:18.630> would<00:05:18.750> crush<00:05:19.380> him<00:05:19.669> what<00:05:20.669> do<00:05:20.729> you<00:05:20.789> say

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139
