00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 hello again I will remind you that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.060
 me car Renault Logan second 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 generations are the simplest equipment and 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 Today I 'm going to the official dealer for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:32.279
 onboard computer activation like this 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.210
 Now it looks like I donâ€™t have it 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.700
 no expense no residue in 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 kilometers only i can 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.180
 drive so now activates me 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460
 on-board computer 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.920
 I will show you what I have added to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.800
 instrument panels 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.360
 Well, in the official family themselves 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.739
 activated the on-board computer and now 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.930
 I have such functions here 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.990
 on the panel 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.840
 this is the consumption of liters per trip to liters 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.820
 100 kilometers 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 9 and 8 it was me driving in traffic means no 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 previous stage 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 instant consumption here is average consumption 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.920
 liters per 100 kilometers but not yet 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.020
 show because generally drove 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 the fact that up to 13 km you need to go 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.810
 at least 100 kilometers you will start 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.619
 show the distance to refuel 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.990
 dash because here I have 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.030
 lit up or gas station kraz i 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.030
 arrived essentially on an empty tank 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 mileage per trip 13 half 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 kilometers this is what i drove from 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.920
 service average speed of 1221 s 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.360
 half a kilometer per hour and which were 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 mileage and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 such a run which is spotted like this 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.560
 here are new features all this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.390
 It cost 210 clay did not say I think 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.930
 which is a very useful thing especially for 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 that kind of money to all who have no onboard 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.570
 computer recommend flashing off 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.270
 official dealer is not at all 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.550
 expensive plus there is a guarantee for 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.550
 car up to the new video for now
