in<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:24.060> channel<00:02:24.360> there<00:02:24.480> are<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.599> lot<00:02:24.719> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
in the channel there are a lot of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.890 
in the channel there are a lot of
animals<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.319> try<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.360> make<00:02:27.360> themselves<00:02:27.569> look

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
animals that try to make themselves look

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.640 
animals that try to make themselves look
bigger

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
bigger

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.309 
bigger
by<00:02:28.829> creating<00:02:29.239> buys<00:02:30.769> on<00:02:31.769> their<00:02:32.400> bodies<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
by creating buys on their bodies and

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.449 
by creating buys on their bodies and
with<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.379> Styracosaurus<00:02:35.129> they've<00:02:35.310> obviously

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
with the Styracosaurus they've obviously

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.459 
with the Styracosaurus they've obviously
gone<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.480> appearance<00:02:37.019> they've<00:02:37.260> tried

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
gone for that appearance they've tried

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.210 
gone for that appearance they've tried
to<00:02:37.620> put<00:02:37.769> these<00:02:37.920> big<00:02:38.159> eyes<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.640> their<00:02:38.819> frills<00:02:40.220> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
to put these big eyes in their frills to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.589 
to put these big eyes in their frills to
make<00:02:41.370> them<00:02:41.519> look<00:02:41.700> as<00:02:41.879> if<00:02:41.939> they're<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> bigger

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
make them look as if they're a bigger

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.809 
make them look as if they're a bigger
animal<00:02:42.840> than<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:43.379> are<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:44.549> that's<00:02:44.730> an

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
animal than they are and that's an

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.210 
animal than they are and that's an
interesting<00:02:45.359> theory<00:02:45.769> we've<00:02:46.769> seen<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.099> on<00:02:47.159> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
interesting theory we've seen it on a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.390 
interesting theory we've seen it on a
few<00:02:47.549> toys<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> maybe<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:50.189> quite<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
few toys so maybe it's it's quite a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.789 
few toys so maybe it's it's quite a
prevalent<00:02:50.879> theory<00:02:51.329> at<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> moment<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.680> can

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
prevalent theory at the moment you can

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.839 
prevalent theory at the moment you can
see<00:02:52.950> these<00:02:53.099> weathered<00:02:54.090> horns<00:02:55.609> very<00:02:56.609> nice

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
see these weathered horns very nice

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.780 
see these weathered horns very nice
indeed<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:58.170> there's<00:02:58.859> some<00:02:58.980> carrion<00:02:59.459> down

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
indeed and there's some carrion down

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.580 
indeed and there's some carrion down
behind<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.420> frill<00:03:00.689> you<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:00.989> see<00:03:01.139> some<00:03:01.349> lovely

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
behind the frill you can see some lovely

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.479 
behind the frill you can see some lovely
sculpted<00:03:02.370> creases<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.769> some<00:03:05.010> nice<00:03:05.189> hanging

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
the back leg again you can see the

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.890 
the back leg again you can see the
musculature<00:03:46.909> defined<00:03:47.909> all<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.269> way<00:03:48.479> down<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
musculature defined all the way down the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.439 
musculature defined all the way down the
leg<00:03:49.109> very<00:03:49.590> nice<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.639> some<00:03:50.849> nice<00:03:51.030> lines<00:03:51.239> of

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
leg very nice and some nice lines of

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.289 
leg very nice and some nice lines of
compression<00:03:51.989> around<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.319> feet<00:03:52.560> there<00:03:53.299> this

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
compression around the feet there this

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.969 
compression around the feet there this
wash<00:03:54.569> really<00:03:54.870> brings<00:03:55.229> out<00:03:55.440> those<00:03:55.680> creases

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
wash really brings out those creases

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.909 
wash really brings out those creases
brings<00:03:56.489> out<00:03:56.699> all<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:57.169> all<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.319> cracks<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
brings out all the all the cracks and

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.849 
brings out all the all the cracks and
crevices<00:03:58.979> and<00:04:00.019> then<00:04:01.019> as<00:04:01.139> we<00:04:01.260> get<00:04:01.379> towards<00:04:01.799> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
crevices and then as we get towards the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.379 
crevices and then as we get towards the
tail<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.609> see<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.970> color<00:04:03.209> is

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
tail you can see the color is

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.349 
tail you can see the color is
transitioning<00:04:03.989> into<00:04:04.139> this<00:04:04.379> green<00:04:04.709> again

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
transitioning into this green again

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.399 
transitioning into this green again
there's<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.419> little<00:04:06.659> bit<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.989> back<00:04:07.139> of<00:04:07.319> the

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
the way down the tail nice bits of

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.770 
the way down the tail nice bits of
orange<00:04:12.810> here<00:04:13.639> such<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.669> bold<00:04:15.060> color<00:04:15.389> scheme

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
orange here such a bold color scheme

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.479 
orange here such a bold color scheme
quite<00:04:16.199> brave<00:04:16.470> really<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.099> like<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.090> do<00:04:18.239> this

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
quite brave really of like to do this

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.310 
quite brave really of like to do this
and<00:04:20.489> again<00:04:20.609> as<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.120> get<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.509> back<00:04:21.690> leg<00:04:21.930> nice

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
and again as we get to the back leg nice

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.490 
and again as we get to the back leg nice
to<00:04:22.560> find<00:04:22.830> musculature<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:25.110> just<00:04:25.289> see<00:04:25.409> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
to find musculature you can just see the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.379 
to find musculature you can just see the
faint<00:04:25.710> lines<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.310> rib<00:04:26.490> cage<00:04:26.729> coming<00:04:27.150> through

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
faint lines of a rib cage coming through

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.279 
faint lines of a rib cage coming through
