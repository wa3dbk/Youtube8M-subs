nowadays while the wall is going to have
treatments<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.659> worry<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.229> probably

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
treatments so don't worry this probably

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.260 
treatments so don't worry this probably
isn't<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.100> even<00:02:05.520> something<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.090> can

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
isn't going to be even something you can

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
isn't going to be even something you can
easily<00:02:06.450> buy<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.409> look<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.710> how<00:02:07.799> much<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
easily buy but look at how much it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.619 
easily buy but look at how much it
absorbed<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.789> hard<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> be

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
absorbed and how hard that's going to be

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.059 
absorbed and how hard that's going to be
too<00:02:09.750> clean

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
too clean

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.699 
too clean
I<00:02:10.569> would<00:02:11.569> definitely<00:02:11.659> say<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.079> want<00:02:12.409> stain

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
I would definitely say you want stain

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.199 
I would definitely say you want stain
resistant<00:02:13.219> carpet<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.819> that's<00:02:13.939> what<00:02:14.120> I've

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
resistant carpet and that's what I've

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.910 
resistant carpet and that's what I've
got<00:02:14.389> a<00:02:14.420> piece<00:02:14.689> of<00:02:14.719> here<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.319> I'm<00:02:15.739> going<00:02:15.859> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
got a piece of here and I'm going to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920 
got a piece of here and I'm going to
stain<00:02:16.189> it<00:02:16.219> with<00:02:16.670> three<00:02:16.999> different<00:02:17.180> substances

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
stain it with three different substances

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.780 
stain it with three different substances
and<00:02:18.200> try<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.590> take<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.920> off<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.310> my<00:02:19.489> green

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and try and take it off with my green

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.289 
and try and take it off with my green
cleaner<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.420> first<00:02:20.719> there's<00:02:21.409> some<00:02:21.799> red<00:02:22.639> wine

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.640 

then<00:02:26.299> I'm<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.689> to<00:02:26.750> do<00:02:26.930> another<00:02:27.139> one<00:02:27.349> grape

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
then I'm going to do another one grape

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.229 
then I'm going to do another one grape
juice<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> last<00:02:28.639> one<00:02:28.849> I'm<00:02:28.909> going<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> do

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
juice and the last one I'm going to do

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.410 
juice and the last one I'm going to do
is<00:02:29.480> catch<00:02:29.780> up<00:02:30.069> for<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.189> next<00:02:31.459> part<00:02:31.730> which<00:02:32.389> is

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
is catch up for the next part which is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.110 
is catch up for the next part which is
the<00:02:32.900> first<00:02:33.079> step<00:02:33.379> of<00:02:33.590> removal<00:02:34.099> would<00:02:34.819> be<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the first step of removal would be to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.059 
the first step of removal would be to
try<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:35.359> spoon<00:02:35.719> some<00:02:35.989> up<00:02:36.169> if<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.439> could<00:02:36.709> so

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
try and spoon some up if you could so

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.649 
try and spoon some up if you could so
I'm<00:02:37.219> going<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.400> take<00:02:37.579> as<00:02:37.790> much<00:02:37.939> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.239> solid

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
I'm going to take as much of the solid

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.129 
I'm going to take as much of the solid
up<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.079> can<00:02:39.349> and<00:02:39.590> remove<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.840> would<00:02:42.019> be

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
up as I can and remove it this would be

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.170 
up as I can and remove it this would be
for<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.349> pet<00:02:42.590> stain<00:02:42.919> or<00:02:43.579> something<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.120> that

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
for a pet stain or something like that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.270 
for a pet stain or something like that
as<00:02:44.419> well<00:02:44.450> next<00:02:45.200> I'm<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.439> to<00:02:45.500> take<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:46.010> white

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
as well next I'm going to take a white

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.709 
as well next I'm going to take a white
terrycloth<00:02:46.639> this<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> hundred<00:02:47.599> percent

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:47.719 
terrycloth this is a hundred percent

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.020 
terrycloth this is a hundred percent
cotton<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.980> solution<00:02:49.400> i'm<00:02:49.489> going<00:02:49.639> to<00:02:49.699> use<00:02:49.849> is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
cotton the solution i'm going to use is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.140 
cotton the solution i'm going to use is
one-half<00:02:50.449> teaspoon<00:02:50.719> of<00:02:51.549> dishwashing<00:02:52.549> liquid

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
one-half teaspoon of dishwashing liquid

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.959 
one-half teaspoon of dishwashing liquid
green<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:53.900> case<00:02:54.199> to<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:54.889> cup<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.699> warm

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
green in this case to a cup of warm

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.449 
green in this case to a cup of warm
water<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.569> I'm<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.439> to<00:02:57.530> dip<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.919> white<00:02:58.189> cloth

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
water and I'm going to dip a white cloth

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.509 
water and I'm going to dip a white cloth
in<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.469> I'm<00:03:00.469> going<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.680> start<00:03:00.859> working<00:03:01.040> around

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
in and I'm going to start working around

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.860 
in and I'm going to start working around
the<00:03:01.609> stain<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:03.560> one<00:03:03.859> is<00:03:04.449> grape<00:03:05.449> juice

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
the stain and this one is grape juice

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.970 
the stain and this one is grape juice
which<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:06.919> classic<00:03:07.609> problem<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:09.049> I'm<00:03:09.709> going

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
which is a classic problem and I'm going

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.330 
which is a classic problem and I'm going
from<00:03:10.159> the<00:03:10.250> outside<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:12.010> notice<00:03:13.010> what<00:03:13.040> it's

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
from the outside in and notice what it's

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.369 
from the outside in and notice what it's
picking<00:03:13.669> up<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.120> it's<00:03:14.299> working<00:03:14.509> I<00:03:14.930> want<00:03:15.319> to

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
picking up so it's working I want to

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.379 
picking up so it's working I want to
take<00:03:15.530> another<00:03:15.769> cloth<00:03:16.189> on<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.729> and<00:03:17.030> put<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.180> in

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
take another cloth on that and put it in

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.479 
take another cloth on that and put it in
clear<00:03:17.659> water<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:21.049> work<00:03:21.799> that<00:03:21.979> a<00:03:22.040> little<00:03:22.310> more

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
clear water and work that a little more

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.360 
clear water and work that a little more
so<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.180> coming<00:03:23.569> up<00:03:23.720> see<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.769> clear<00:03:24.979> water<00:03:25.189> is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
so it's coming up see the clear water is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.249 
so it's coming up see the clear water is
not<00:03:25.519> picking<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.509> way<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:27.259 
not picking it up the way that the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.439 
not picking it up the way that the
solution<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.370> now<00:03:28.790> what<00:03:28.939> I'm<00:03:29.030> going<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.239> do<00:03:29.329> at

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
solution is now what I'm going to do at

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.499 
solution is now what I'm going to do at
this<00:03:29.599> point<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:30.459> finish<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.639> off<00:03:31.790> with<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
this point is finish it off with the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.979 
this point is finish it off with the
cool<00:03:32.720> water<00:03:32.989> on<00:03:33.259> all<00:03:34.040> three<00:03:34.400> stains<00:03:34.989> starting

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
cool water on all three stains starting

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.599 
cool water on all three stains starting
with<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.229> wine<00:03:36.439> and<00:03:37.069> I'm<00:03:37.189> going<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.370> pull<00:03:37.519> up

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
with the wine and I'm going to pull up

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.759 
with the wine and I'm going to pull up
more<00:03:37.729> pressure<00:03:38.000> on<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:38.840> epicenter<00:03:39.470> where<00:03:39.620> we

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
more pressure on the epicenter where we

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.600 
more pressure on the epicenter where we
seem<00:03:39.979> to<00:03:40.099> have<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.280> problem

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.550 

and<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.390> seems<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:43.930> working<00:03:44.110> for<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
and that seems to be working for that

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.900 
and that seems to be working for that
one<00:03:44.740> as<00:03:44.890> well<00:03:45.180> fact<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.450> one<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:47.910> essentially

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
one as well fact that one is essentially

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.200 
one as well fact that one is essentially
gone<00:03:49.590> well<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.950> result<00:03:51.490> of<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.880> green

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
gone well this is a result of the green

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.080
