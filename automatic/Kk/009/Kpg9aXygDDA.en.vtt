00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.380
 video tutorial on how to start a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.310
 Private browsing on your device in your 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.030
 device that can be the ipad iphone 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.030
 or ipad 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.930
 good hello guys how are you very 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.780
 aligned 95 this time I bring you a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.510
 new video tutorial for about how 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 make a private browsing from 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.470
 safari many times good this is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.590
 important since 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.100
 many times they tell us to download 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.910
 applications of new browsers that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.220
 download google chrome that 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.230
 download something because not this time what 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.840
 let's learn to activate the new the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.210
 private browsing and how to identify if 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.180
 you are with the elevation the navigation 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.840
 Private good before we leave 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.840
 for adjustments 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.530
 we go for adjustments will disappear 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.450
 person then we went down and searched 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.409
 where to go the safari 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.170
 the part where I did the safari there is a 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.049
 option that says privacy in this part 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.179
 says private browsing and as percussed 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.380
 in the supercookies as decisions would have 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:33.110
 which are the ones that allow you to save 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.110
 for example in passwords and so on 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.440
 in good here it says to accept cookies 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.990
 but in the private version 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.680
 same 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 in this part we when 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.149
 we activate we get a message and from 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.399
 close all pages in this part 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.840
 if you want to keep the pages that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.670
 you have open inside your safari 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 example if you had one open 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.360
 page of not being from google that this one 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.659
 you had some kind of truth information 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.849
 and do not want to lose because the NomÃ¡s 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.769
 keep in this part we already have 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.170
 activate private browsing as 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.210
 we identify that we have the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.610
 test navigation activated 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.470
 we go to safari if 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.670
 you look at the color of this is 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.130
 celestial is not like celeste at your side 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.110
 but if we activate navigation 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.600
 private 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 we go to safari and this becomes 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.510
 black this is very useful because sometimes if 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.450
 we good this as it is a place of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.370
 story then imagine yourself suddenly 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.220
 you come and you're looking for something for me and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.690
 suddenly you remember the drag and you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.390
 you agreed that you have to look for it from 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.820
 again then when we go back in 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 here and I will not find it is very 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.370
 important to realize this if you 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.950
 safari is black you're in mode 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.500
 an active version on and if it 's 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.440
 is the style is because the option 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.310
 activated the test animation is 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.379
 deactivated good in theory this would be 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.810
 everything we are going to do a series of tests 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.810
 to see if it really works 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.319
 well here are all the pages ok 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.269
 all my history 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.989
 now let's go to navigation 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.989
 we activate to conserve 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.930
 as I am is in 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:51.280
 in the history because he was not removing it 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.280
 and good to see if we put blogs fort 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.890
 or not 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.470
 let's open this suddenly we come 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.569
 we came out with the explanation 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.460
 let's go 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.890
 ar 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.890
 let's not get this out ok 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.960
 ok we have 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.960
 says pink and we go to blog 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.880
 yes pot 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.810
 dot com 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.680
 I do not know if you can see well, but 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.620
 good 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.290
 94 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.880
 through the test that was achieved 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.860
 see well 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.860
 now we come close this 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.830
 We use the 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.450
 and there we see that if it works 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.639
 and I hope it has served you well 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.159
 well that's mostly for the 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.810
 people that review the iphone or 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.810
 are looking for some information 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.440
 they are not looking for some kind of 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:34.280
 information and you do not want anyone to 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:39.540
 see and it was already if they start to review your 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:44.400
 history and as we see here they are saved 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.290
 if we do it so they are good 95 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.440

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.400
