00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi guys here we are back with a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.390
 new video and as you surely know 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.820
 yesterday 10 September there was the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.370
 apple conference where they were 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.509
 presented the iphone 5 s is the iphone 5 c is 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.940
 but before talking about this 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.000
 conference I wanted to tell you to leave a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.260
 I like it on my facebook page 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.910
 since I changed it because since 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.119
 I could not change my name 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.270
 change the name of the facebook page 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.950
 so I had to make a new one 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.230
 find the link in the description then 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.059
 if you have if you had already put I like it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 to the old facebook page now 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.590
 put it to the new one 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 and if you didn't put it I don't even like it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 the old facebook page then 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 immediately putting on the new one 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.969
 find the link in the description and time 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.890
 let's go to yesterday's conference where 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.680
 main news as I told you before 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.440
 were the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5 c 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.590
 then the main new features of the iPhone 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.000
 5 they are that now there is a sensor 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.010
 that recognizes fingerprints 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 so we can unlock ours 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 device simply by pressing here 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.820
 on the home button 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.610
 this is this fingerprint reader 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.450
 digital will also have other uses ad 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.680
 example we could buy some 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.619
 apps from the app store without anymore 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 put it past but just touch with 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.040
 the titles on the home button and then it was 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.920
 greatly improved the camera 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.650
 pixels have also been added 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 always remained the same 8 megapixel 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.689
 and a flash has been added 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.490
 which governs what they regulate 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.189
 the university and therefore makes it look like the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 our photos even more our photo at 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.490
 dark still more natural and then it was 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.600
 slow mode will be added 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.250
 motion that allows you to make video at 720p 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.289
 with 100 120 fps and I saw a video is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.130
 really a spectacular thing 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.970
 I look forward to coming out and iphone 5s 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.910
 it should be out by December 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.540
 and while in other countries will be released on the 20th 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.739
 September while ios 7 should come out 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.790
 on September 18 and the iPhone 5 will have a 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.360
 will always cost 729 euros in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.410
 theory should be and then we talk about 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.380
 iphone 5 iphone 5 c will always come out within 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.660
 December and we say a half species 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.290
 of iphone 5 because the processor is 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.329
 always the 6 then we have a camera 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.250
 always 8 megapixels 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.950
 but a very beautiful thing and that is 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.359
 available in many six colors 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.209
 different if I'm not mistaken and line up 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:06.890
 always from 4 to 4 inches with retina 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.989
 display and the price should be on 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.319
 600 euros so there is not much difference 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.209
 it's not as cheap as you hoped e 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.900
 did not bring it to inference between the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:24.060
 price of the iPhone 5 s of 729 euros from 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.859
 that of 600 of the iPhone 5 c and then it is 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.889
 A video of 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.840
 infinity blade 3 that should come out 18 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.630
 September I can't wait for it to come out e 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.190
 so expect some gameplay on mine 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.739
 channel and and these were the main ones 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.920
 news that have been shown to this 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.900
 conference and I remember leaving a 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 quite a bit of death 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.180
 subscribe to the channel if not yet 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.760
