00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.230
 hey I want you morally today 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.880
 force show for the time being 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.110
 that's a pretty much the 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.509
 most controversial bush force better that it 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.340
 There are many people who would say 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 say it's the white controversial the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 knife that exists because she is not 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.609
 as cleaning staff that is here 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:33.920
 nothing sounds so fresh 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:45.570
 forces and us forward 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:47.270
 Then the blade also tapers like that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:58.680
 to see popular 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:01:05.909
 she just gets thinner at the front point 10 0 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:13.229
 18 meters long I believe 25 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.119
 millimeter strength and I have that now 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:22.320
 What I am doing now with about a week 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:24.710
 long tested and it is in itself 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.759
 quite well 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 I seem to have one now 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.490
 a whole lot dislike there you have to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.829
 Pretty good the rubber grip likes now 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 not so i am there so the five of wood 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.040
 but it is really slip resistant 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.119
 even if it is wet or bloody 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 or something like that I do not know 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 how long I think I know what 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 about up to this point will therefore yet 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.170
 already relatively deep drum relatively deep 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170
 in it 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.239
 i am actually away from kultil film 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.400
 I like is much better knife 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.750
 very easy 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.040
 What I really like about me now 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.480
 knife is actually the most bothersome 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.549
 that it is so easy that it's chop 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.700
 almost impossible so so have the 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.970
 So here's another one 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.239
 built-in stop and thank you here as well 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.099
 Get it right here and do it 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.150
 was really great to have so 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:46.549
 incredibly easy ago 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:49.109
 So I can build almost no power 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.810
 I have already tried a lot 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:56.220
 but it just can not be done 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.030
 stainless steel my eyes now too 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:05.939
 re - points and that is just 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.720
 Sandweg steel is installed in it 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:14.040
 give gives at least moral the handle is 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.019
 in itself quite ergonomic many people 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.989
 have problem the smaller have that 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.489
 You here 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.400
 Mittelfinger come on it and then is 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.859
 it was quite uncomfortable in the meantime 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.799
 but with me now actually quite good 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.449
 that this is actually quite good 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.269
 but he is pretty good pure 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:36.540
 in between it is also quite good in the 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.040
 hand here you have a very good handle 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.569
 can still hold up well here 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.680
 Sweating is not really that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.739
 I would stress it now 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.349
 do not operate alone on your own 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.720
 because it's such a relatively thin one 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:56.069
 Klinger has and primarily 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.889
 because it's here in this for 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.370
 Boys have this thinner king and 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:05.699
 that's why I find it here now 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.729
 wood piece is and then over there it 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.440
 the risk of breakage again a lot higher 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.959
 just so white and dennis 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.409
 stable shape 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.430
 but you can through the tapered tip 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.430
 the movie's blade shape 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.200
 on average I work quite well so better 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.640
 In my opinion, even doing that is 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.000
 a super carver my opinion 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:35.540
 simply because it's so thin 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.120
 because it's because the pieces of wood you get 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.120
 Do not stop immediately 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.010
 just so that the demolition protection is too 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.930
 very strong so I almost 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.470
 impossible to slip and get on 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.360
 to hurt the blade 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.460
 what else is there to worry about exactly that 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.030
 top trend So the sounds has one 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.330
 joint 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:12.680
 there is minimal so almost not 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:15.650
 i do not know what i say 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.370
 that's just one now 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.870
 little video about what I got from it 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.070
 think now of the knife if demand 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.520
 I can also agree again 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.800
 make review by keeping the knife still 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:39.710
 before your eyes on your body and yours 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:41.540
 Guests go and I want to show then 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.200
 what it needs that we sometimes that 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.110
 knife in action advises the distinction had 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.400
 not here now I have one 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.690
 Small leather shit built that way 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.340
 I have the original page I can 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.740
 The case is made of plaste and 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.690
 also a nice drain hole what 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.310
 pretty bad country is not 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.090
 available 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.090
 I have also seen a few times 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.450
 that I do not like so much about the 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:16.700
 It is a shame that they are not like those 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.500
 moral companions at the idol clip below 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.110
 open that you just over the 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.760
 belt can get stuck 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.840
 they are simply consistent throughout 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.169
 you have to pull through the belt 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.660
 otherwise I like the cover quite well 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:36.630
 I like everyone because of that I have one 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.630
 leather case so
