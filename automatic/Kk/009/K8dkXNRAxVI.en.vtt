00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.660 
it's kind of a good idea that is how it
started<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.500> she<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:16.010> kind<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.250> my<00:02:16.400> hardcore

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
started and she was kind of my hardcore

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.000 
started and she was kind of my hardcore
beta<00:02:17.120> tester<00:02:17.600> she'd<00:02:17.990> take<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.890> know

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
beta tester she'd take it up you know

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.860 
beta tester she'd take it up you know
uphill<00:02:19.340> all<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> time<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.330> say<00:02:20.450> huh<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.840> know

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
uphill all the time and say huh you know

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.710 
uphill all the time and say huh you know
it's<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:21.620> soft<00:02:22.040> or<00:02:22.460> yeah<00:02:23.420> when<00:02:23.630> I'm

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
it's a little soft or yeah when I'm

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050 
it's a little soft or yeah when I'm
going<00:02:23.960> over<00:02:24.200> about<00:02:24.410> 30<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:25.250> feels<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.910> little

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
going over about 30 it feels a little

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.120 
going over about 30 it feels a little
little<00:02:26.540> she's<00:02:27.110> giving<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.710> feedback

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
little she's giving you all the feedback

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.780 
little she's giving you all the feedback
on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.520> way<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.730> develop<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.360> thing<00:02:30.790> that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
on the way to develop this thing that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.970 
on the way to develop this thing that
leads<00:02:32.030> me<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.480> toss<00:02:32.840> let's<00:02:33.170> talk<00:02:33.380> about<00:02:33.500> specs

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
leads me to toss let's talk about specs

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.260 
leads me to toss let's talk about specs
and<00:02:34.190> things<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:34.820> there's<00:02:35.060> two

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
and things like that so there's two

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.729 
and things like that so there's two
models<00:02:35.420> we've<00:02:35.690> got<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.900> standards<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
models we've got the standards and the

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.400 
models we've got the standards and the
BR<00:02:37.100> it's<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.970> electric<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.959> charge<00:02:39.140> takes

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
BR it's all electric the charge takes

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.260 
BR it's all electric the charge takes
from<00:02:39.590> five<00:02:39.830> hours<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:40.790> also<00:02:41.000> fast

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
from five hours and we can also fast

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.330 
from five hours and we can also fast
charge<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.020> right<00:02:42.500> around<00:02:42.590> an<00:02:42.800> hour<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
charge it in right around an hour the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.790 
charge it in right around an hour the
vehicle<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.970> go<00:02:44.150> 35<00:02:44.930> miles<00:02:45.200> an<00:02:45.320> hour<00:02:45.470> it's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
vehicle can go 35 miles an hour it's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.979 
vehicle can go 35 miles an hour it's
constructed<00:02:46.400> entirely<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:47.090> aircraft-grade

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
space so if for instance say I had a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.440 
space so if for instance say I had a
truck<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.489> was<00:02:55.610> heading<00:02:55.850> into<00:02:55.970> work<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.390> I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
truck and I was heading into work and I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.580 
truck and I was heading into work and I
didn't<00:02:56.630> want<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.810> drive<00:02:56.930> all<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.170> way<00:02:57.290> into

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
didn't want to drive all the way into

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.850 
didn't want to drive all the way into
town

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
town

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.430 
town
could<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.340> feasibly<00:02:58.940> pick<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.810> up<00:03:00.020> throw<00:03:00.350> it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
could I feasibly pick this up throw it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.530 
could I feasibly pick this up throw it
in<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.590> back<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.950> truck<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.670> get<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.420> out

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
in the back of the truck and get it out

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.150 
in the back of the truck and get it out
when<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.900> time<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.230> ride<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.530> last<00:03:03.680> 10<00:03:03.980> days

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
when it's time and ride the last 10 days

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.470 
when it's time and ride the last 10 days
into<00:03:04.489> work<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.850> that's<00:03:05.030> really<00:03:05.090> like<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
into work and that's really like the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.880 
into work and that's really like the
whole<00:03:05.600> point<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.110> then<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.560> have<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
whole point and then you have the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.890 
whole point and then you have the
optional<00:03:07.310> add-on<00:03:07.610> which<00:03:07.820> is<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.390> seat<00:03:08.720> as

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
optional add-on which is the seat as

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900 
optional add-on which is the seat as
well<00:03:09.020> for<00:03:09.230> those<00:03:09.320> who<00:03:09.560> really<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.550> want<00:03:10.820> to

take it easy you can actually sit down

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.630 
take it easy you can actually sit down
on<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.530> thing<00:03:12.680> as<00:03:12.770> well<00:03:12.920> round<00:03:13.130> enough

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
on the thing as well round enough

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.670 
on the thing as well round enough
exactly<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.510> does<00:03:14.690> solve<00:03:14.989> what<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.380> like<00:03:15.590> to

which is you live downtown you work
downtown<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:21.070> parking<00:03:22.070> space<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.489> car

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
downtown and parking space for a car

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.940 
downtown and parking space for a car
cost<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.330> of<00:03:23.420> two<00:03:24.200> or<00:03:24.290> three<00:03:24.320> hundred<00:03:24.709> bucks<00:03:24.800> a
