tech channel today I'm going to show you
an<00:00:07.919> interesting<00:00:08.719> Wi-Fi<00:00:09.719> booster<00:00:10.250> Cydia<00:00:11.250> tweak

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
an interesting Wi-Fi booster Cydia tweak

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.660 
an interesting Wi-Fi booster Cydia tweak
which<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.080> filed<00:00:13.320> as<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:14.099> guessed<00:00:14.309> right

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
which can be filed as you guessed right

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.800 
which can be filed as you guessed right
in<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.540> Cydia<00:00:15.929> app<00:00:16.609> now<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.570> does

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
in a Cydia app now what this thing does

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.130 
in a Cydia app now what this thing does
is<00:00:19.380> boost<00:00:20.130> your<00:00:20.310> Wi-Fi<00:00:20.850> or<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> other<00:00:21.840> hand

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is boost your Wi-Fi or on the other hand

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650 
is boost your Wi-Fi or on the other hand
it<00:00:22.410> eliminates<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.340> Apple<00:00:23.820> restriction<00:00:24.510> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it eliminates the Apple restriction of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380 
it eliminates the Apple restriction of
Wi-Fi<00:00:25.320> signals<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.580> example<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.210> see

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
Wi-Fi signals for example you can see

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.570 
Wi-Fi signals for example you can see
I'm<00:00:27.510> connected<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.199> own<00:00:28.500> wireless<00:00:29.070> which

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
I'm connected to my own wireless which

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.080 
I'm connected to my own wireless which
is<00:00:30.080> minus<00:00:31.080> 53<00:00:32.480> in<00:00:33.480> signal<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.610> see

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
is minus 53 in signal and I can also see

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.440 
is minus 53 in signal and I can also see
other<00:00:36.440> surrounding<00:00:37.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:38.160> switch<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.850> much

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
other surrounding Wi-Fi switch have much

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.720 
other surrounding Wi-Fi switch have much
much<00:00:39.750> less<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.340> minus

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
much less as you can see there are minus

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.350 
much less as you can see there are minus
102<00:00:42.540> 103<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
102 103 and so on these are just the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
102 103 and so on these are just the
neighbor<00:00:45.539> rings<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.680> basically<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.370> could

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
neighbor rings so basically you could

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.119 
neighbor rings so basically you could
virtually<00:00:48.480> connect<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.530> were<00:00:49.860> not

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
virtually connect if these were not

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.779 
virtually connect if these were not
locked<00:00:51.059> networks<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.129> scan<00:00:53.460> around

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
locked networks and you can scan around

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
locked networks and you can scan around
around<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.870> don't<00:00:54.899> need<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
around you and you don't need a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.110 
around you and you don't need a
third-party<00:00:56.129> app<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
third-party app for that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.750 
third-party app for that
so<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.930> basically<00:00:58.500> eliminates<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> Apple

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so this basically eliminates the Apple

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.900 
so this basically eliminates the Apple
restrictions<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.600> wireless<00:01:01.559> signals<00:01:02.219> Apple

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
restrictions of wireless signals Apple

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.289 
restrictions of wireless signals Apple
will<00:01:03.059> only<00:01:03.270> let<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.140> scan<00:01:05.299> wireless

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
will only let you just scan wireless

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.850 
will only let you just scan wireless
networks<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.200> strong<00:01:07.530> enough<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
networks that are strong enough to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.090 
networks that are strong enough to
connect<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.960> tweet<00:01:10.170> illuminates

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
connect to this little tweet illuminates

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.100 
connect to this little tweet illuminates
that<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.150> basically<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> Cydia<00:01:13.760> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
that so basically to go to Cydia and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
that so basically to go to Cydia and
search<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> app<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.460> called<00:01:17.970> Wi-Fi

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
search for the app which is called Wi-Fi

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.550 
search for the app which is called Wi-Fi
booster<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> BigBoss<00:01:20.820> repo

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
booster it's right in the BigBoss repo

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.749 
booster it's right in the BigBoss repo
it<00:01:22.560> cost<00:01:23.119> $1.99<00:01:24.119> almost<00:01:25.110> $2<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.280> compatible

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it cost $1.99 almost $2 it's compatible

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.069 
it cost $1.99 almost $2 it's compatible
