00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.879
 its located almost in the center 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.160
 of our city is the embankment 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.420
 Well , there are also industrial zone 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.440
 which now 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.690
 shaving does not work and I decided to pick up 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 to the building that suited me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.580
 internal per 1000 square meters 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 it used to be a powerful workshop 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.880
 injection molding machines I decided to remake 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.359
 the museum is now here is the pavement 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 tile 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.369
 before that, our concrete was collected here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.520
 homeland was rich and lay here 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 cast iron tile somewhere so tons 30 but also 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.910
 from afar successful metal 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 another room lay aluminum tile 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.899
 volume 10 we are so half its weight 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 believed she knew metal too 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 we go and with this money built a museum 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 no somewhere else in america on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 I did not get it I bought without it 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 that is, we decided to restore it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.110
 so again we have metal scrapers 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.730
 bought a cast iron tile 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.949
 one by one how are we here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.629
 because not so much rich restored 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.359
 the plane is 60 square meters so that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.520
 it was clear how it even looked like 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.369
 this project is the hardest in terms of what 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.979
 body volume is big and this bus 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.229
 made three masters that is everyone is sewn up 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.330
 bus like bogdan and bardan ride themselves 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 along the street in which everyone can 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.250
 kate shuttle bus is not a mess sorry 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.290
 this is cards 651 54 years 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.030
 if you look at a banana in 10 years 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.009
 it practically falls apart because 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 the car is very big and got it 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 poor condition occupied floors 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 that is, in fact only one remained of him 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.750
 frame and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.210
 and there is no roof, too , and the openings 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 side windows i.e. it is known that 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 left for me 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 from that time everything else had to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.710
 re-digest look for new 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.539
 rabbits and that is, we bought for 30 thousand 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.750
 hryvnia somewhere eyeliner drove here for 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:51.209
 10 coloring it spent on 25 thousand 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.369
 hryvnia that is actually the cost 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.079
 paint not counting the work overlaps 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.369
 the cost of the car itself that is but 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.709
 it is so that people think 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.459
 but you see maybe even every day 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.709
 practically 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.939
 beautiful red fire engines that is 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.740
 I constantly tint them and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.619
 maintains a combat state that is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.840
 think about the scale of the city or 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.940
 the whole country how much does it cost us to keep 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.400
 fire brigade in such a decent way 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.280
 judging because you say every 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.040
 exhibit is not cheap 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.110
 pleasure this museum to create well 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.720
 of course it's not cheap new I owe it 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.760
 finish it to the end already spent the night well 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.590
 why did you start but because they 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.390
 fell out sezo continue cars 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.790
 it was necessary to collect in one decent 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 place so it is worth a garage with a friend 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.730
 this is also from a friend and the third from someone on 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.609
 factory 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.889
 so they were all going to divorce on 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.600
 some big exhibition and always 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.489
 when people came they suffered from 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.660
 In order that we want every day to 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.700
 you go to visit look at these 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.500
 cars well, for the sake of these people did 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.910
 well in real 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.770
 Substance for collected on delivery 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.770
 enterprises by metal or reduction 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.950
 road signs that stood 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.100
 good gold found windmill on the internet 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.780
 the start of nonsense 50 hryvnia but for the concept 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.640
 I could not find where his museum 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.150
 pitch though the rooster method is very 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.400
 liked 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.190
 Well, such reached the concept of what 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.530
 need a bollard with ads is good 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.470
 cockpit nest newspaper 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.050
 hereby when the workers are here 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.370
 do repairs saw this cabinet they 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.290
 started offering 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.180
 that they have old newspapers 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.850
 wonderful news of the Dnieper evening 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.040
 well and when they glued the cabinet it is very 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.870
 strongly delayed because each 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.510
 the newspaper was read by them again that is 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.580
 tom point or somewhere week when we 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.610
 probably went video that concept 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.690
 our facade is black and white checkered 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.000
 finish flag 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.780
 that is, but it is no accident because my museum 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.700
 we have a kind of sport 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.950
 It turned out that this museum will 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.110
 Ukraine has the largest collection 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.380
 collection with the tony formula of estonia 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.830
 mass-produced cars 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.620
 former baltic and tallin that is 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.300
 usually about 2000 all athletes from them 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.220
 started their circuit races and all 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.280
 will be here 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.970
 survivors but represented here 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.420
 it turns out five cars 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.430
 i.e. close to the museum it is machines 8 then 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.180
 there will be in second place after 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.360
 greek museum 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.100
 well now we stand in front of a wonderful 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.690
 the failure of the opening of this museum is like 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.350
 Kharkov colleagues said 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 that the museum is local to the museum chosen 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.040
 landmark then we dug the foundation by 2 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.490
 the floor that is somehow called me on 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.370
 job foreman with a transitional voice was looking for 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.850
 than i fell through the ground 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.300
 Well, as they say thoughts were different about 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.730
 what is the underwater river here 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.580
 but of course the treasure may possibly be 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.960
 treasure of the third reich 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.750
 quickly gathered from work I arrived 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:08.600
 here it was red passed quickly 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.680
 the British in 2013 as well, through 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.780
 two days i would have to be here 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.640
 gala dinner of the participants but we 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.950
 I decided to just dig in this I mano hands 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.790
 itched terrible power when then we 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.180
 started his cult geneva just this 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.060
 digging a hole with high hopes 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.610
 it really happened here 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:32.780
 Three KAMAZ garbage it turns out that this shop 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.569
 built residential homes and when i went 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.460
 neighbor intelligence 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.949
 Mandri like your team cops that we 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.650
 the town has not been connected before 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:47.870
 really told that this is kapustin's house 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.189
 there was such a person and he really had 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.900
 basement I was very surprised that such 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.430
 deep basement without you really here 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.000
 you see two meters it's really beneficial 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.430
 4 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.169
 already spat on it thought to sleep there 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.919
 back one man began to dig further 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.770
 sewn really past motorcycles but we 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.939
 thought that this motorcycle twigs 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.630
 ran sensible Vasily Pankratov 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:11.060
 which is a specialist in motorcycles 900 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.780
 serial 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.600
 but since he eats one powerful him 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.500
 here leave our visiting monuments 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:25.250
 the card that the bike was on it here 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.260
 same building museum well what are you now 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.020
 see it of course still under repair 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.360
 inflatable it is clear to everyone that is 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.090
 of course there will be more saturated here 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.150
 more interesting well, so I wrote in my 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.139
 stories on the site give it will be and gender 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.060
 80 that is, you will be here 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.450
 it is we by the way are supposed 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.680
 Cafe 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:50.330
 that is, if you saw the concept around 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.460
 there is a road and they will be placed here 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.680
 car i.e. there will be an illusion of what you 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.229
 are on the old street riding around 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.630
 old car runs your new 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:07.040

 original appearance not tinted coffee 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:26.360
 a copy of the original that is which 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.439
 conveys the life of our Ekaterinoslav 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.860

 you shot an illustrated fight that is according to 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:36.020
 imagine it like that

 Well, the planned opening of this November 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:48.589

 everyone can come here beautifully too 

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:52.969
 residents of the city charge for free some 

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:55.999
 see but in order to pay rent 

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:57.499
 keep the land for a cleaner at the guard 

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:02.469
