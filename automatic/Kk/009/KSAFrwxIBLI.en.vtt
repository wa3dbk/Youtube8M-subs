00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.800
Since the flood barrier of Muang Ake Village has collapsed.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.810
Citizens are suggested to evacuate as soon as possible.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.010
It's no longer able to barry the flood.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.710
The water level has reached 1 meter.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.580
The flood is going to reach Muang Ake Village.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.880
Most of the citizens are evacuating.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.490
It seems like we can't stay here anymore.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.890
It will flood all over the place...

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.590
Then where should we move?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.390
I don't have any other place to go...

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.090
My parent has an old house in Chantaburi.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.300
We might go to stay there until the flood's gone.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.900
Is it okay? I don't want to bother you

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.800
Nah, it won't be any trouble.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.400
There's no one living at the house.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000
Why?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.610
My parent said that the house is abandoned...

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.210
The last owner of this house had thrown her child in fire

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.510
to do a strange ceremony...

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.420
The light's out...?
