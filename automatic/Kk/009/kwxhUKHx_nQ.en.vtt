00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
hey guys it's me cubics and this is

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.980 
hey guys it's me cubics and this is
another<00:00:08.519> voiceover<00:00:09.120> unboxing<00:00:09.719> which<00:00:09.840> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
another voiceover unboxing which is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.480 
another voiceover unboxing which is
unfortunate<00:00:10.620> because<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:11.099> not<00:00:11.309> something

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
unfortunate because it's not something

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.390 
unfortunate because it's not something
that<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.820> planned<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.990> original<00:00:13.440> video<00:00:13.710> had

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that I planned the original video had

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.970 
that I planned the original video had
really<00:00:14.880> crappy<00:00:15.330> audio<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.710> wasn't

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
really crappy audio and it just wasn't

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
really crappy audio and it just wasn't
really<00:00:17.100> usable<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> video<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> removed

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
really usable for the video so I removed

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.170 
really usable for the video so I removed
it<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> voiceover<00:00:20.640> now

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it and right now this is a voiceover now

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.670 
it and right now this is a voiceover now
the<00:00:21.240> only<00:00:21.510> part<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.990> voiceover<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.529> what

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the only part that's a voiceover is what

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.410 
the only part that's a voiceover is what
you're<00:00:22.800> seeing<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.130> which<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.820> purely<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you're seeing here which is purely the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.689 
you're seeing here which is purely the
unboxing<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.769> impressions<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.400> still

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
unboxing the first impressions I still

unboxing the first impressions I still
have<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.090> yet<00:00:27.300> filmed<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> time<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.890> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

audio recording I haven't even turned
the<00:00:31.470> cube<00:00:31.830> yet<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.320> after<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> unbox<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.280> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the cube yet so after I unbox this I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
the cube yet so after I unbox this I
will<00:00:35.969> actually<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.829> switching<00:00:37.829> over<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
will actually be switching over to the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
will actually be switching over to the
camera<00:00:40.350> again<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.660> giving<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.809> first

camera again and giving my first
impressions<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> cube<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.820> course

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
impressions of the cube but of course

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
impressions of the cube but of course
this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> unboxing<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.289> isn't

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
this is just the unboxing and this isn't

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
this is just the unboxing and this isn't
a<00:00:46.739> boxing<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:47.550> gun<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.210> speedcube

this<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:53.550> wasn't<00:00:53.730> expecting<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:55.140> be

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
this I really wasn't expecting to be

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.150 
this I really wasn't expecting to be
able<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> test<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.390> it's<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.949> cube

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
able to test this it's so it's a cube

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270 
able to test this it's so it's a cube
that's<00:00:59.280> been<00:00:59.550> intriguing<00:01:00.539> me<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.250> really<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that's been intriguing me for really a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
that's been intriguing me for really a
couple<00:01:02.520> months<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.229> no<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.530> lie

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
couple months or no that's a lie

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.880 
couple months or no that's a lie
whenever<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.390> first<00:01:06.630> announced<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.619> at

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
whenever was first announced it was at

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
whenever was first announced it was at
least<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.280> month<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.270> I've<00:01:09.900> been

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
least a month I think so I've been

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
least a month I think so I've been
trying<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.340> cube<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
trying to know a lot about this cube and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.280 
trying to know a lot about this cube and
to<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.280> hands<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
to actually have it in my hands now is

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.210 
to actually have it in my hands now is
pretty<00:01:16.340> surreal<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.920> box

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pretty surreal so as you can see the box

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.330 
pretty surreal so as you can see the box
is<00:01:20.520> pretty<00:01:21.090> much<00:01:21.450> exactly<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.100> hoy

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is pretty much exactly like the one hoy

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.179 
is pretty much exactly like the one hoy
made<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:24.360> Diane<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> course<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> fake

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
made by Diane this of course is a fake

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.179 
made by Diane this of course is a fake
gun<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.180> honest<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.740> knockoff

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
gun and to be honest it's a knockoff

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
gun and to be honest it's a knockoff
there's<00:01:30.090> always<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.509> slight<00:01:30.840> chance<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
there's always a slight chance that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.289 
there's always a slight chance that
think<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.310> Diane<00:01:32.610> had<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.060> sort<00:01:33.270> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
think on and Diane had some sort of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.499 
think on and Diane had some sort of
partnership<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.430> legal<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
partnership going and so it's legal the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
partnership going and so it's legal the
other<00:01:36.750> possibility<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.770> fame

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
other possibility is that fame

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.890 
other possibility is that fame
connoisseur<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> vid<00:01:38.909> division<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.509> Diane

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
connoisseur the vid division of Diane

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.190 
connoisseur the vid division of Diane
sort<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.799> changshan<00:01:41.340> ghost<00:01:41.610> hand<00:01:41.909> um<00:01:42.200> but

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
sort of like changshan ghost hand um but

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.010 
sort of like changshan ghost hand um but
I<00:01:43.320> find<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.100> unlikely<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.899> this

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I find that really unlikely so for this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020 
I find that really unlikely so for this
video<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.560> assuming<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.700> knockoff

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
video I'm assuming it's a knockoff

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
video I'm assuming it's a knockoff
there's<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.049> slight<00:01:49.380> chance<00:01:49.560> I'm<00:01:49.799> incorrect

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
there's a slight chance I'm incorrect

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.270 
there's a slight chance I'm incorrect
but<00:01:51.000> until<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.229> otherwise<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
but until I know otherwise I'm going to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609 
but until I know otherwise I'm going to
treat<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.729> cube<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> knockoff<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
treat this cube as a knockoff and in the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.179 
treat this cube as a knockoff and in the
review<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> discuss<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.189> both

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
review I'm going to discuss it both

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.209 
review I'm going to discuss it both
objectively<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.180> subjectively<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
objectively and then subjectively but of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.319 
objectively and then subjectively but of
course<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> unboxing<00:02:03.210> on

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
course this is just the unboxing on

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
course this is just the unboxing on
first<00:02:03.570> impressions<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.009> am<00:02:05.670> indeed

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
first impressions so I am indeed

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.570 
first impressions so I am indeed
treating<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> knockoff<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
treating it as a knockoff so yeah you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820 
treating it as a knockoff so yeah you
can<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.849> how<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> cube<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.239> really<00:02:09.450> dusty<00:02:09.830> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
can see how the cube is really dusty I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.610 
can see how the cube is really dusty I
don't<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.950> nothing<00:02:14.459> major<00:02:15.140> but<00:02:16.140> yeah

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
don't know it's nothing major but yeah

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.650 
don't know it's nothing major but yeah
so<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> cubism<00:02:17.250> box<00:02:17.430> now<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.300> I'm<00:02:18.480> actually

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
so the cubism box now so I'm actually

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
so the cubism box now so I'm actually
going<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.020> turn<00:02:19.140> over<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.500> camera<00:02:19.860> again

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
going to turn over to the camera again

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
going to turn over to the camera again
so<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.150> actually<00:02:21.420> turn<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> cube<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
so that I can actually turn the cube and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.339 
so that I can actually turn the cube and
give<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:22.800> first<00:02:23.010> impressions<00:02:23.510> hey<00:02:24.510> guys<00:02:24.750> I'm

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
give my first impressions hey guys I'm

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.530 
give my first impressions hey guys I'm
back<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.950> I'm<00:02:26.250> going<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.910> first<00:02:27.180> turns

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
back and I'm going to do the first turns

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030 
back and I'm going to do the first turns
and<00:02:27.870> first<00:02:28.110> impressions<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> cube<00:02:28.860> now

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and first impressions of the cube now

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.339 
and first impressions of the cube now
unfortunately<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.420> battery<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.230> new

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
unfortunately the battery on the new

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.410 
unfortunately the battery on the new
camera<00:02:31.739> died<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.010> hi<00:02:32.550> back<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.940> using<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.269> old

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
camera died so hi back to using the old

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.900 
camera died so hi back to using the old
camera<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.620> still<00:02:34.800> HD<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.519> that's<00:02:35.760> all

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
camera but it's still HD so that's all

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.059 
camera but it's still HD so that's all
good<00:02:36.180> first<00:02:37.080> let's<00:02:37.349> just<00:02:37.410> take<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> look<00:02:37.830> at<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
good first let's just take a look at the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.009 
good first let's just take a look at the
stickers<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.760> white<00:02:38.940> seems<00:02:39.180> pretty<00:02:39.690> bright

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
stickers the white seems pretty bright

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.699 
stickers the white seems pretty bright
the<00:02:40.830> other<00:02:40.950> colors<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.459> me<00:02:41.670> actually<00:02:41.940> look<00:02:42.709> the

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
the other colors to me actually look the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.309 
the other colors to me actually look the
same<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.220> Diane<00:02:44.610> ones<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.840> yellow<00:02:46.019> might

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
same as the Diane ones the yellow might

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.619 
same as the Diane ones the yellow might
be<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:46.680> bit<00:02:46.860> better<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.910> not<00:02:48.239> by<00:02:48.390> much

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
be a little bit better but not by much

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.800 
be a little bit better but not by much
so<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:51.030> definitely<00:02:51.420> something<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so it's definitely something that I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.720 
so it's definitely something that I
would<00:02:51.989> replace<00:02:52.349> eventually<00:02:53.220> at<00:02:53.489> some<00:02:53.519> point

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
would replace eventually at some point

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.790 
would replace eventually at some point
but<00:02:54.330> right<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:54.660> they<00:02:54.870> seem<00:02:55.050> okay<00:02:55.200> let's

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
but right now they seem okay let's

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.589 
but right now they seem okay let's
actually<00:02:55.920> look<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.550> piece<00:02:56.970> before<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.330> turn

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
actually look at a piece before you turn

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.070 
actually look at a piece before you turn
it<00:02:58.159> and<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.760> see<00:02:59.940> how<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.239> pretty<00:03:00.959> much

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it and you can see how it is pretty much

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.890 
it and you can see how it is pretty much
exactly<00:03:01.319> like<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.680> Diane<00:03:02.069> q<00:03:02.480> we<00:03:03.480> won't<00:03:03.659> go<00:03:03.780> into

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
exactly like a Diane q we won't go into

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050 
exactly like a Diane q we won't go into
pieces<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.440> too<00:03:05.099> much<00:03:05.220> detail<00:03:05.459> right<00:03:05.849> now<00:03:05.909> but

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
pieces in too much detail right now but

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.390 
pieces in too much detail right now but
you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.599> see<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.319> exactly<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.250> a

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
you can see that it is exactly like a

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.540 
you can see that it is exactly like a
Zanjeer<00:03:09.019> actually<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.140> torpedo<00:03:10.769> looks

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
Zanjeer actually the torpedo looks

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.390 
Zanjeer actually the torpedo looks
pretty<00:03:12.060> thin<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.860> might<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.190> different

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
pretty thin so that might be different

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.040 
pretty thin so that might be different
and<00:03:14.760> shall<00:03:15.150> let's<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:15.420> look<00:03:15.540> at<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.690> corner

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
and shall let's just look at a corner

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.110 
and shall let's just look at a corner
and<00:03:17.930> we'll<00:03:18.930> see<00:03:19.489> okay<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:20.550> there<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:20.849> some

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and we'll see okay so there are some

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.119 
and we'll see okay so there are some
differences<00:03:21.450> from<00:03:22.170> what<00:03:22.379> I<00:03:22.409> can<00:03:22.500> tell<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
differences from what I can tell the

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.160 
differences from what I can tell the
curves<00:03:23.550> are<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:23.879> lot<00:03:24.030> sharper<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:27.170> but

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
curves are a lot sharper on this and but

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860 
curves are a lot sharper on this and but
overall<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.739> piece<00:03:28.970> looks<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> same<00:03:30.330> one

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
overall the piece looks the same one

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.390 
overall the piece looks the same one
thing<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.200> am<00:03:31.409> pretty<00:03:31.680> curious<00:03:32.099> about<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
thing that I am pretty curious about is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.899 
thing that I am pretty curious about is
actually<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> center<00:03:32.940> cap<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:35.180> oh<00:03:36.830> that's

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
actually the center cap and oh that's

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.470 
actually the center cap and oh that's
that's<00:03:38.909> interesting<00:03:40.879> when<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:41.940> pick<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.150> up<00:03:42.299> for

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
that's interesting when I pick it up for

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.039 
that's interesting when I pick it up for
one<00:03:46.310> yeah<00:03:47.310> see<00:03:47.610> that's<00:03:47.760> okay<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.629> kind<00:03:49.019> of

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
one yeah see that's okay this is kind of

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.160 
one yeah see that's okay this is kind of
what<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.200> was<00:03:49.730> considering<00:03:50.730> at<00:03:50.879> I<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.870> it's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
what I was considering at I know it's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.899 
what I was considering at I know it's
not<00:03:52.319> in<00:03:52.379> focus<00:03:52.830> but<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.670> doesn't

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
not in focus but that really doesn't

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.670 
not in focus but that really doesn't
matter<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.840> middle<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.230> center<00:03:55.470> cap

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
matter in the middle of the center cap

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.670 
matter in the middle of the center cap
can<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.099> how<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.459> kind<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.819> um<00:03:57.470> fuzzy<00:03:58.470> or

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
can you see how it's kind of um fuzzy or

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.030 
can you see how it's kind of um fuzzy or
it<00:03:59.220> seems<00:03:59.879> scruffed<00:04:00.269> up<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.049> regular

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
it seems scruffed up on a regular

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.130 
it seems scruffed up on a regular
zhanchi<00:04:02.480> well<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.540> mean<00:04:03.629> this<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.930> cam

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
zhanchi well I mean this is a cam

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.339 
zhanchi well I mean this is a cam

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.890 
viewers Angie but Ana's Anqi you can see
that<00:04:07.590> there's<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.830> logo<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:09.299> middle<00:04:09.540> again

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
that there's a logo in the middle again

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.990 
that there's a logo in the middle again
this<00:04:10.200> isn't<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.560> focus<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.459> don't<00:04:11.760> think<00:04:11.849> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
this isn't a focus but I don't think it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.479 
this isn't a focus but I don't think it
matters<00:04:12.120> there<00:04:13.049> is<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> logo

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
matters there is a logo

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.020 
matters there is a logo
Dianne's<00:04:15.060> logo<00:04:15.360> obviously<00:04:15.840> on<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:17.489> there

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
Dianne's logo obviously on this there

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.499 
Dianne's logo obviously on this there
isn't<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.810> flush<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.729> scruffed<00:04:21.239> at

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
isn't it's flush but it is scruffed at

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.439 
isn't it's flush but it is scruffed at
the<00:04:21.660> middle<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.340> what<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.520> kind<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:24.000> tells<00:04:24.210> me

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
the middle so what this kind of tells me

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.200 
the middle so what this kind of tells me
is

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
is

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.600 
is
that<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.569> is<00:04:25.810> actually<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.740> recasted

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
that this is actually just a recasted

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.040 
that this is actually just a recasted
zhanchi<00:04:28.449> like<00:04:29.319> it's<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.560> knockoff<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:31.050> the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
zhanchi like it's a knockoff and the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.490 
zhanchi like it's a knockoff and the
only<00:04:33.330> thing<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.630> they<00:04:34.810> did<00:04:35.110> was<00:04:35.289> basically

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
only thing that they did was basically

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.240 
only thing that they did was basically
remove<00:04:36.069> the<00:04:36.250> logos<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.990> were<00:04:38.440> made<00:04:39.130> of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
remove the logos that were made of

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.909 
remove the logos that were made of
plastic<00:04:39.370> obviously<00:04:40.180> from<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.900> zhanchi<00:04:41.110> so

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
plastic obviously from the zhanchi so

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.320 
plastic obviously from the zhanchi so
that's<00:04:42.310> why<00:04:42.430> it's<00:04:42.550> scruffed<00:04:42.849> up<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.210> then

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
that's why it's scruffed up and then

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.360 
that's why it's scruffed up and then
they<00:04:43.449> just<00:04:43.599> recasted<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.319> pieces<00:04:44.710> so

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
they just recasted the pieces so

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.070 
they just recasted the pieces so
epically<00:04:45.910> yeah<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:46.449> not<00:04:47.139> too<00:04:47.410> happy<00:04:48.190> about<00:04:48.460> this

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
epically yeah I not too happy about this

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.960 
epically yeah I not too happy about this
there's<00:04:50.080> always<00:04:50.289> a<00:04:50.440> slight<00:04:50.800> chance<00:04:51.190> that<00:04:51.460> they

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
there's always a slight chance that they

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.420 
there's always a slight chance that they
kind<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.449> either<00:04:53.349> bought<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:54.009> rights<00:04:54.250> to

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
kind of either bought the rights to

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.120 
kind of either bought the rights to
produce<00:04:54.699> this<00:04:55.060> cube<00:04:55.389> or<00:04:55.750> have<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.740> partnership

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
produce this cube or have a partnership

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.879 
produce this cube or have a partnership
with<00:04:57.370> Diane<00:04:58.180> do<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.199> really<00:04:59.560> believe<00:04:59.860> that

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
with Diane do I really believe that

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.939 
with Diane do I really believe that
personally<00:05:00.520> no<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.120> don't<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:02.020> do<00:05:02.380> think<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.800> is

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
personally no I don't I do think this is

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.629 
personally no I don't I do think this is
a<00:05:02.979> straight-up<00:05:03.310> knockoff<00:05:03.789> but<00:05:04.889> again<00:05:05.889> it's

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
a straight-up knockoff but again it's

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.279 
a straight-up knockoff but again it's
it's<00:05:07.330> something<00:05:07.690> that<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:07.990> will<00:05:08.110> definitely

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
it's something that I will definitely

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.469 
it's something that I will definitely
talk<00:05:08.740> about<00:05:08.800> in<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.250> review<00:05:09.610> for<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.240> first

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
talk about in the review for the first

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.420 
talk about in the review for the first
impressions<00:05:10.930> though<00:05:11.110> it's<00:05:12.039> not<00:05:12.250> all<00:05:12.400> that

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
impressions though it's not all that

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.120 
impressions though it's not all that
important<00:05:13.120> let's<00:05:14.110> just<00:05:14.410> actually<00:05:14.740> turn<00:05:14.949> this

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
important let's just actually turn this

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.290 
important let's just actually turn this
because<00:05:15.310> I<00:05:15.460> know<00:05:15.520> that's<00:05:15.849> what<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:16.030> want<00:05:16.210> to

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
because I know that's what you want to

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.600 
because I know that's what you want to
know<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:17.560> it's<00:05:18.190> pretty<00:05:18.460> awful<00:05:18.750> it's<00:05:19.750> not<00:05:20.139> good

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
know and it's pretty awful it's not good

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.309 
know and it's pretty awful it's not good
it<00:05:21.610> feels<00:05:21.880> exactly<00:05:22.210> like<00:05:22.419> the<00:05:22.690> first<00:05:22.870> Sanchi

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
it feels exactly like the first Sanchi

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.870 
it feels exactly like the first Sanchi
that<00:05:23.500> I<00:05:23.530> ever<00:05:23.770> got<00:05:23.889> which<00:05:24.280> was<00:05:24.430> with<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.729> old

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
that I ever got which was with the old

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.290 
that I ever got which was with the old
plastic<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:26.610> don't<00:05:27.610> think<00:05:27.819> this<00:05:27.909> is<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.150> old

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
plastic I don't think this is the old

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.589 
plastic I don't think this is the old
plastic<00:05:28.720> though<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:29.139> think<00:05:29.800> what<00:05:29.919> it<00:05:30.039> is<00:05:30.190> is

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
plastic though I think what it is is

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:37.920 
plastic though I think what it is is
just<00:05:32.280> Baloo<00:05:35.430> yeah<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:36.490> can<00:05:36.699> see<00:05:36.909> how<00:05:37.060> there's

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
just Baloo yeah you can see how there's

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.240 
just Baloo yeah you can see how there's
like<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.080> coating<00:05:38.380> near<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> base<00:05:38.889> of<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.130> edge

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
like a coating near the base of the edge

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.339 
like a coating near the base of the edge
it<00:05:39.520> seems<00:05:40.330> like<00:05:40.479> some<00:05:40.659> sort<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.930> silicone

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
it seems like some sort of silicone

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.469 
it seems like some sort of silicone
spray<00:05:41.590> I<00:05:41.889> think<00:05:42.520> what<00:05:42.639> cameron<00:05:43.000> was<00:05:43.090> referring

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
spray I think what cameron was referring

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.379 
spray I think what cameron was referring
to<00:05:43.570> in<00:05:43.750> his<00:05:43.870> video<00:05:44.199> was<00:05:44.889> d39<00:05:45.639> which<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:46.270> an

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
to in his video was d39 which is an

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.439 
to in his video was d39 which is an
orange<00:05:46.599> can<00:05:46.930> very<00:05:47.409> popular<00:05:47.860> in<00:05:47.979> Asia<00:05:48.389> so<00:05:49.389> I

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
orange can very popular in Asia so I

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.040 
orange can very popular in Asia so I
think<00:05:49.570> that's<00:05:49.870> what<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:50.199> is<00:05:50.380> lubed<00:05:50.590> with<00:05:50.830> and

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
think that's what this is lubed with and

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.620 
think that's what this is lubed with and
the<00:05:53.050> zhanchi<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:53.860> got<00:05:54.180> was<00:05:55.180> lubed<00:05:55.479> with

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
the zhanchi that I got was lubed with

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.270 
the zhanchi that I got was lubed with
something<00:05:56.020> similar<00:05:56.259> so<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:56.800> think<00:05:56.919> that's<00:05:57.190> what

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
something similar so I think that's what

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.209 
something similar so I think that's what
accounts<00:05:57.490> for<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.789> similar<00:05:58.090> feel<00:05:58.860> as<00:05:59.860> far<00:06:00.099> as

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
accounts for the similar feel as far as

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.240 
accounts for the similar feel as far as
actual<00:06:00.580> performance<00:06:01.479> of<00:06:01.509> the<00:06:01.570> cube<00:06:01.810> goes<00:06:02.250> it's

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
actual performance of the cube goes it's

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.040 
actual performance of the cube goes it's
really<00:06:03.340> fast<00:06:03.820> especially<00:06:04.539> for<00:06:04.690> something<00:06:04.840> out

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
really fast especially for something out

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:21.879 
really fast especially for something out
of<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.229> box<00:06:07.560> yeah<00:06:08.560> it's<00:06:08.830> nice<00:06:12.990> yeah<00:06:13.990> not<00:06:14.349> bad
