00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.660
 Imagine you have a great fun 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.060
 new old 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 second hand ate denim jacket and you mean it 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 him somewhere 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.849
 there you forget him and nobody knows 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.419
 that is yours then you will never get it 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.970
 more 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.130
 I have a solution for that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.120
 we are going to write our names on the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.770
 back of the denim jacket pale 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.390
 claim is bold 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 there you go very gently means 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.730
 what do you need for this cool cool 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.010
 ideas and practice your handwriting 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 practice or of course just another one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.879
 have a paper with pale that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.230
 we have not entered yet 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.059
 what I wait until the very last moment 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.670
 a pencil 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.670
 custom and of course your jeans 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.229
 first you need the handwriting with which you 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:13.100
 want to write name and maybe you want 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.900
 also some nice flowers in addition 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 then you write your name again 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 but now on the jeans using 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.570
 brook just put an old magazine 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.570
 under your jacket 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.409
 it's nice if you like the in some places 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 pale what thicker does and on some 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.159
 places correct or less what one do you have 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.729
 a little difference in thickness 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.729
 depth 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 if you are satisfied with the result 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.200
 leave the bleach in for two hours 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.330
 just go for something nice 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.450
 are the second in your jacket until then 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.380
 leave the washing machine and washing 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.380
 drying and 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.670
 oh my god breaking news 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.250
 suddenly shot me again in something 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.730
 what I always did in the classroom with alicia 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.460
 who is talisha this is talia 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.410
 it was not really a class but the set 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.510
 of span gas 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.010
 but now back to what I thought of as 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.050
 we are bored 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.760
 always in the week how much we 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.760
 percent of us loved us
