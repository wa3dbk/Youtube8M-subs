back and I think that combination

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.509 
back and I think that combination
because<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.660> know<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> woman<00:02:07.229> has<00:02:07.890> those<00:02:08.220> two

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
because you know a woman has those two

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.580 
because you know a woman has those two
salads<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.509> there's<00:02:10.200> something

salads you can have there's something

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.310 
salads you can have there's something
very<00:02:10.739> flowy<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.750> woman<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.140> then

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
very flowy you know about woman but then

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.930 
very flowy you know about woman but then
they<00:02:13.440> also<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.860> their<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.430> know<00:02:14.550> strong

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.300 
side and I think he combines that
beautifully<00:02:18.090> also<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.570> way<00:02:18.800> how<00:02:19.800> he<00:02:19.860> brings
