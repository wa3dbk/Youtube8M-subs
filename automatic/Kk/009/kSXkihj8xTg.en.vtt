00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 in the friends in this opportunity they 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.519
 I bring the room with android 5.1 created 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.130
 by alberto de x de app of which I made 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 a review days ago the process is 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.109
 pretty simple it's pretty much like 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.970
 install a custom room but you have to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.250
 consider the following first 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.500
 as always the bootloader unlocked 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.109
 motorola driver installed the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.359
 debug usb activated we must also 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.730
 to have the lollipop bootloader 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.340
 so I recommend you do the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.280
 procedure from any room with 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.739
 Android 5 points 0.2 that is the retail 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 of Argentina from Brazil and Argentina 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.879
 soon I will try it in the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 google play edition well I'll leave you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.190
 a folder in mega with the name of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.710
 android 5.1 which will contain two 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 rare files one that is the room and the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 another is going to be the google apps pretty 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.469
 simple, this is what we are going to do here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.079
 the phone's internal memory and we're going 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.059
 to proceed to install the custom 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.820
 recovery to be able to perform the process 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.339
 well as you can see I already have here the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.119
 two weird files that we're going to do is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.460
 this folder and to install the rich eri 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.569
 we have two options one that is the way 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.119
 traditional installing the double erp tv 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:20.429
 2.8 point 6.0 which is the most recent or 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.880
 doing it through the application of 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.189
 wrc manager for which we need to be 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.560
 root user and can download it from 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.569
 the play store good seeing said this 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.969
 I use the traditional way I will 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.859
 disconnect and turn off the device to 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.899
 put it in facebook mode already with the 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.390
 team in facebook mode and connected the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.810
 usb cable what we are going to do is open 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.180
 the folder tw erp and simply 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.370
 we run the flash recovery bat file 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.520
 and that's it, that would be it when we go out 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.960
 the purple letters mean 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 that is already installed we are going to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.370
 disconnect the equipment and once here 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.320
 let's go down with the volume key 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.979
 less and with the volume key more 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.979
 we accept 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 well once here what we are going to do 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.620
 it's the same as what we do to install 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.319
 a custom room we will make the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:21.620
 corresponding waves we are going to white 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.620
 advanced white and we select dalvik 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.660
 cache and system we give in sweet to 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.660
 white 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.190
 let's see go back again and 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.610
 then we went to install 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.640
 once here we are going to go down we are going to 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.580
 choose the room 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 5.1 we give in atmore ships and place 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.810
 the google apps ready we pull the bar 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.940
 and we wait for the installation to finish 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.130
 the only thing we have left to do is 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.130
 give in reboot system 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.620
 as you can see this the boot animation 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.840
 that we found in google pressure 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.330
 normally this beginning of being 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.330
 taking about 56 minutes 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.120
 and as you can see, we already entered and 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.600
 we are in the configuration screen 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.569
 initial I'll do it and I'll go back 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.690
 you are already at our desk 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.640
 with android 5.1 I wanted to tell you that 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.310
 the initial configuration is also 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.780
 it takes a little bit so patience in 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.050
 this moment we are going to go directly 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.819
 to configuration about the device and 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.400
 As you can see, we already have the 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.400
 version 5.1 of android 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.200
 also tell them that the application of 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.120
 default messages does not work thing 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.430
 which I suppose they arranged in 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.129
 later updates but can 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.190
 download google messenger or some other that 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.049
 you prefer now to finish 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.360
 tell them if they want to use 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.930
 your mobile data plan what they should 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.510
 do is go to configuration more networks 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.989
 mobile 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.180
 and enter the access point name 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.700
 to where it is also in a circle and 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.560
 configure the network according to the operator 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.889
 they own and the country where they 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.349
 find 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.240
 good friends that would be all I hope that 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.060
 have been useful do not forget to give 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.909
