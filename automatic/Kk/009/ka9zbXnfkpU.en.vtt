00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
so you have to be really fast really

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.200 
so you have to be really fast really
hungry<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.049> also<00:01:50.890> really<00:01:51.220> hard<00:01:51.610> with<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.030> bike

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.289 
hungry and also really hard with a bike
and<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:53.619> have<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:54.009> give<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.549> feeling<00:01:55.000> inside

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
and we have to give this feeling inside

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.149 
and we have to give this feeling inside
the<00:01:55.600> game<00:01:55.750> with<00:01:55.930> life<00:01:56.140> in<00:01:56.470> these<00:01:56.650> feelings<00:01:57.040> of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
the game with life in these feelings of

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.580 
the game with life in these feelings of
the<00:01:57.280> game<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.420> develop<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.990> new<00:01:59.170> physics

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
the game and so we develop a new physics

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.609 
the game and so we develop a new physics
that<00:01:59.860> is<00:02:00.040> not<00:02:00.250> coming<00:02:00.610> from<00:02:00.640> moto<00:02:01.030> GP<00:02:01.450> or<00:02:01.630> for

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
that is not coming from moto GP or for

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.910 
that is not coming from moto GP or for
cc<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.159> convincing

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
cc is convincing

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.810 
cc is convincing
is<00:02:04.369> only<00:02:04.850> for<00:02:05.240> mxgp<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.140> we<00:02:07.070> started<00:02:07.700> from

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
is only for mxgp and we started from

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.969 
is only for mxgp and we started from
scratch<00:02:08.060> with<00:02:08.750> his<00:02:08.899> new<00:02:09.080> pieces<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.709> we

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
scratch with his new pieces and we

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.490 
scratch with his new pieces and we
define<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> cool<00:02:10.670> engine<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.239> then<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:11.959> ask<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
define a cool engine and then we ask the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.949 
define a cool engine and then we ask the
riders<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.610> try<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:13.849> engine<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.569> give<00:02:14.780> us

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
riders to try this engine and give us

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.589 
riders to try this engine and give us
their<00:02:15.290> feedback<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.150> Tony

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
their feedback and so we have Tony

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.600 
their feedback and so we have Tony

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.930 
Cavalli that went to us to try the game
and<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.239> had<00:02:20.800> Bernie<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.400> they<00:02:22.550> were<00:02:22.700> nearly

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
and we had Bernie and they were nearly

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.300 
and we had Bernie and they were nearly
that<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.569> Philip<00:02:23.840> rods<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.319> then<00:02:24.709> some<00:02:24.890> rubino

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that is Philip rods and then some rubino

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.640 
that is Philip rods and then some rubino
from<00:02:25.790> an<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.060> too<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.050> we<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.350> three

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
from an is too so we have three

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.920 
from an is too so we have three
gardeners<00:02:27.980> from<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.670> means<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:29.690> for

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
gardeners from the means one and one for

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.330 
gardeners from the means one and one for
a<00:02:30.440> mix<00:02:30.680> too<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.330> they<00:02:32.470> went<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.769> my<00:02:33.950> son<00:02:34.220> in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
a mix too and they went in my son in

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.850 
a mix too and they went in my son in
different<00:02:34.700> moments<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:35.599> this<00:02:35.780> they<00:02:36.140> first

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
different moments so this they first

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.120 
different moments so this they first
started<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:38.030> first<00:02:38.330> tried<00:02:38.540> uh<00:02:38.950> let's<00:02:39.950> say

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
started they first tried uh let's say

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
started they first tried uh let's say
previous<00:02:40.550> version<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> pieces<00:02:41.510> out<00:02:41.690> they

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
previous version of the pieces out they

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.280 
previous version of the pieces out they
handing<00:02:42.350> off<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> bike<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:44.019> then<00:02:45.019> they<00:02:45.140> give

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
handing off the bike and then they give

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.559 
handing off the bike and then they give
us<00:02:45.440> something<00:02:45.860> back<00:02:46.040> very<00:02:46.370> specific<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.299> order

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
us something back very specific in order

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.800 
us something back very specific in order
to<00:02:47.750> develop<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.230> game<00:02:48.560> as<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:49.400> will<00:02:49.730> be<00:02:50.150> so

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to develop the game as it will be so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.590 
to develop the game as it will be so
attentive<00:02:51.410> as<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.010> motocross<00:02:52.940> riders<00:02:53.299> passed

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
attentive as the motocross riders passed

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.920 
attentive as the motocross riders passed
by<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:54.890> after<00:02:55.010> or<00:02:55.459> let's<00:02:55.640> say<00:02:55.819> one<00:02:56.690> month

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
by and so after or let's say one month

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.750 
by and so after or let's say one month
then<00:02:57.049> came<00:02:57.410> back<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:58.310> tried<00:02:58.549> another

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
then came back and they tried another

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.699 
then came back and they tried another
version<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.660> this<00:03:00.100> process<00:03:01.989> can<00:03:02.989> give<00:03:03.500> us

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
version and so this process can give us

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.420 
version and so this process can give us
the<00:03:04.010> Kratt<00:03:04.519> feedback<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.330> order<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.630> develop

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the Kratt feedback in order to develop

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.530 
the Kratt feedback in order to develop
physics<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> handling<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.329> bike

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
physics and the handling of the bike

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.160 
physics and the handling of the bike
that<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.400> authentic<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.730> terms<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.269> writing

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
that is authentic in terms of writing

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.190 
that is authentic in terms of writing
style<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.859> also<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.970> nice<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.570> play<00:03:14.690> because

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
style and also a nice to play because

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.349 
style and also a nice to play because
all<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:15.530> riders<00:03:15.769> are<00:03:16.100> players<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.180> is

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
all these riders are players and so is

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.020 
all these riders are players and so is
easy<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.780> understand<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:18.350> corolla<00:03:18.829> is

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
easy to understand that corolla is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.400 
easy to understand that corolla is
trying<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.209> give<00:03:20.359> us<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.810> feedback<00:03:21.019> as

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
trying to give us the feedback as

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.430 
trying to give us the feedback as
brothers<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.220> also<00:03:23.090> filled<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.600> cosplayer<00:03:24.140> and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
brothers but also filled a cosplayer and

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.270 
brothers but also filled a cosplayer and
this<00:03:25.130> too<00:03:25.400> was<00:03:25.609> really<00:03:26.290> an<00:03:27.290> advantage<00:03:27.859> in

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
this too was really an advantage in

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.490 
this too was really an advantage in
during<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.700> develop<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.299> development<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.200> a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
during the develop the development of a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.530 
during the develop the development of a
mix<00:03:30.920> GP<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.579> they<00:03:32.570> also<00:03:32.780> helped<00:03:33.290> us<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
mix GP and they also helped us to

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.930 
mix GP and they also helped us to
recreate<00:03:35.540> all<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.870> trucks<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.470> all<00:03:37.040> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
recreate all the trucks and all the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:47.990 
recreate all the trucks and all the
that<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.570> find<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.260> game

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.060
