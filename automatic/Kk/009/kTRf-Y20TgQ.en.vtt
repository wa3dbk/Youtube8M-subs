relatively small if replicated over the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.910 
relatively small if replicated over the

can really result in pretty substantial

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
can really result in pretty substantial
savings<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.040> exactly<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> kind<00:01:59.880> of

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
savings and this is exactly the kind of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.639 
savings and this is exactly the kind of
award<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.200> help<00:02:01.350> generate

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
award that I think will help generate

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.380 
award that I think will help generate
that<00:02:02.070> spirit<00:02:02.549> I'm

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that spirit I'm
