00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.729
 the universe is made up of small particles 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.489
 tiny units that interact and transform around us 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.539
 that when joining 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 so original wonderful miracle that we call 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.909
 Life is made up of small moments that humans 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.960
 between my experiences 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.280
 that linger in our minds forever 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 and that give us the opportunity to enjoy 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.180
 each of the people who inhabit this world are individuals who 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 we exist and live together 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.430
 tiny beings in the middle of a vast universe 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.030
 able to forge history 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.540
 and makes reality 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 what seemed impossible 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 when talented people join their efforts with a common goal 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.920
 dreams can come true 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.370
 Today we know that these dreams are what many people crave 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.070
 of having a life expectancy are kept in a small part within 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340
 of our body 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.770
 after years of research 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.410
 now we can say 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.020
 that hope 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.960
 hiddink each one of us 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440
 we are friends stem cells 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.800
 the first and only institution in mexico that offers the integral service 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.510
 of collection and shelter 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.370
 of stem cells of adults over 18 years of age and protection of stem cells 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.680
 umbilical cord 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.560
 Our team is made up of national and foreign professionals 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.510
 who have dedicated their lives to study the secrets of this small cell that 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.730
 It exists inside our body 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.490
 through the collection and multiplication of stem cells 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.680
 We can offer a new future 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 Well now we know 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.670
 that the key to successfully treating some of the medical conditions of 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.399
 the present is there 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.919
 something so small 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.459
 One cell among thousands can really make a big difference 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.689
 there are cases around 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.930
 that prove that the treatment of various types of diseases as well as 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.889
 The repair of damaged tissues and organs can be done effectively 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.889
 using stem cells 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.549
 small steps have taken us 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.129
 gil that the collection 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.920
 multiplication and safeguard of stem cells are a reality in Mexico 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.959
 today we have seven laboratories the most advanced equipment 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.290
 and the experience of professionals committed to providing a new 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.259
 hope 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.199
 through a painless process we get stem cells that we can 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.099
 multiply 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.810
 and these can be differentiated to know their behavior and apply them 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.950
 in specific treatments or for the repair of a particular organ 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.239
 with some damage 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.059
 with modern technology 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.019
 we can protect our stem cells 8 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.619
 so that tomorrow 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:17.170
 each one of us 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.170
 count on a hope of life and well-being 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.569
 small particles that make up the universe 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.719
 small moments that make up our life 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.719
 small steps that achieve great events 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.079
 today we can say 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.459
 that a small cell that exists within each one of us 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.529
 can transform 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.229
 added stem cells 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.929
