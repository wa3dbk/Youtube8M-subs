00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone guys here etm then there are 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.810
 many with this new video this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.730
 I bring you a really great video 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 special because a nuclearized in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 all against all as many do not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 they had asked and finally today they are 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.010
 here to bring it and I tell you right away that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.680
 this game was really a lot 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.680
 sweating because I had two or three days 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.269
 they are all against all 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 I really is committed and committed 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 then in the end I managed to bring you 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.440
 this game play 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.680
 excuse me for a moment if the game to a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 sure I'll cut it but the cinema is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.910
 done so because the innkeeper purchased two 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 times 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.129
 so now he'll jump from three kills 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.500
 However, 10 or 11 bridges are then at the end 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.699
 you will still see 30 0 so you don't 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 worry and nothing is here for me 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 give you some advice on this 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.239
 how on how maybe he will manage to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.329
 take a nuclear make a nice one 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.549
 game anyway then it is first 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.430
 let's start from the class for sure 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.900
 make a nuclear for those who 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.820
 they are the first and recommended weapons 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.640
 definitely a silencer 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.430
 in fact this ms mc is equipped with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 a fast charger silencer like 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.250
 for that I used inflexible ghost 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.880
 jackal and dexterity and now the will go 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 to say the reason of which is using 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 ghost and as you can see from the dell 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 Italy had c4 and an electric shock 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.979
 then let's start right away from the reasons i 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.119
 these are the recommended parking lots 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 precisely inflexible and phantom yes 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.560
 because ghost is fundamental in this 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 in fact everyone goes with the web 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.689
 and ghosts will really need you so much if 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 you want to do or nuclearized e 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.070
 inflexible will help you with 10 decisions 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.930
 to get straight to the face while to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.909
 what about jackal is a must on 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.219
 you will need to use all the classes 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.280
 if he is not all against all and dexterity 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.950
 ditto or maybe you want to replace it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.500
 with 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.890
 how is it called beyond the limit? here 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 you can do it but I would recommend you 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.360
 dexterity 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.150
 while for the c4 it is also 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.910
 that's a must and I preferred 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.900
 put the electric thick because 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.910
 having been there for a few days 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.800
 I tried to do it and found myself 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.060
 really good with this shock indeed 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.150
 it really saved me many occasions 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.010
 so no kids these a and vi 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.560
 also advises you to keep a spot like 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.170
 you are seeing in these moments 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.700
 I was so the whole game until 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.519
 I didn't take the visa in this part 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.140
 because they all spurred me on this 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.030
 area so it's really a lot 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.849
 advisable to take a spot and e 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.349
 manage yourself or a little better then in three 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.329
 guys these were a little bit i 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.680
 advice that I can give you of course 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.910
 I'm not very experienced because I have it 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.220
 made both games but I don't have 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 could experience the best this 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.420
 mode so this is a bit 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.269
 tactics that I managed to take from 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.730
 this mode is nothing I wanted 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.660
 take advantage of these moments for 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.340
 thank you for almost 1,800 members e 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.840
 nothing I invite you to leave a beautiful one 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.650
 my case is this video because it deserves 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.910
 really a lot and I ask you to 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.600
 comment subscribe to the case still not 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.670
 you did it 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.709
 then enter ghazi pid atm all there 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.709
