there and then blink and do this what

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.410 
there and then blink and do this what
does<00:00:40.650> this<00:00:40.770> pose<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.970> doesn't<00:00:42.270> look

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
does this pose about it doesn't look

does this pose about it doesn't look
like<00:00:42.450> he's<00:00:43.340> looking<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> bazooka<00:00:45.329> he

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
like he's looking at the bazooka he

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
looks like he's looking right here

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
looks like he's looking right here
there's<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.199> little<00:00:49.350> pose<00:00:49.620> change<00:00:50.010> from

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
there's very little pose change from

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
there's very little pose change from
here<00:00:50.609> to<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.170> idea<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.609> is<00:00:54.059> I'm

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
here to here the idea in this now is I'm

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.979 
here to here the idea in this now is I'm
concerned<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> threat<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:57.480> pose

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
concerned about a threat and the pose

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
concerned about a threat and the pose
doesn't<00:00:58.410> change<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:59.129> eyes<00:00:59.280> change<00:00:59.730> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
doesn't change just the eyes change so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
doesn't change just the eyes change so
just<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> few<00:01:01.019> frames<00:01:01.289> ago<00:01:01.559> he<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.829> concerned

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
just a few frames ago he was concerned

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.430 
just a few frames ago he was concerned
about<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.519> threat<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:03.719> he's<00:01:03.870> looking<00:01:04.050> down

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
about a threat and now he's looking down

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.710 
about a threat and now he's looking down
here<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> threat<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:05.940> here<00:01:06.300> because

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
here is there a threat from here because

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.180 
here is there a threat from here because
the<00:01:06.930> only<00:01:06.960> idea<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:07.470> know<00:01:07.620> is<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> he's

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
the only idea I know is that he's

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.460 
the only idea I know is that he's
concerned<00:01:08.550> about<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> threat<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.200> idea

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
concerned about a threat and the idea

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.930 
concerned about a threat and the idea
hasn't<00:01:10.740> changed<00:01:11.040> substantially<00:01:11.190> enough<00:01:11.790> for

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
hasn't changed substantially enough for

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.240 
hasn't changed substantially enough for
me<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.120> get<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.690> right<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.100> we've<00:01:14.220> got

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
me to get out of that right so we've got

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060 
me to get out of that right so we've got
to<00:01:14.460> change<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> idea<00:01:15.180> substantially<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to change that idea substantially if I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
to change that idea substantially if I
were<00:01:17.220> looking<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.940> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> distance<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
were looking like in the distance at a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
were looking like in the distance at a
looming<00:01:19.680> threat<00:01:19.710> which<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.729> keeps<00:01:20.850> making

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
looming threat which just keeps making

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
looming threat which just keeps making
sure<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.450> coast<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> clear<00:01:21.869> there's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> threat

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
sure the coast is clear there's a threat

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
sure the coast is clear there's a threat
and<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.340> wanted<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> bazooka

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and I wanted to think about the bazooka

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.850 
and I wanted to think about the bazooka
I<00:01:25.439> probably<00:01:26.070> wouldn't<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.680> type<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
I probably wouldn't do this type of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
I probably wouldn't do this type of
thing<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.280> probably<00:01:29.490> turn<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.240> head<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
thing I would probably turn my head and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.800 
thing I would probably turn my head and
look<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> bazooka<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> thing<00:01:33.780> about

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
look at the bazooka but the thing about

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.319 
look at the bazooka but the thing about
it<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.649> not<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.040> sure<00:01:35.070> he<00:01:35.549> would<00:01:35.700> turn<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it is I'm not so sure he would turn and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.889 
it is I'm not so sure he would turn and
look<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> bazooka<00:01:38.030> anyway<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.509> he

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
look at the bazooka anyway because he

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.929 
look at the bazooka anyway because he
knows<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.320> there<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.520> trying<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.790> get

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
knows it's there if you're trying to get

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
knows it's there if you're trying to get
the<00:01:42.119> idea<00:01:42.420> he's<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.140> combat<00:01:43.770> trained<00:01:44.460> guy

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the idea he's not a combat trained guy

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
the idea he's not a combat trained guy
and<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> he<00:01:45.450> has<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> decide<00:01:46.110> should<00:01:46.469> I<00:01:46.590> fight

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and that he has to decide should I fight

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.120 
and that he has to decide should I fight
back<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.869> me<00:01:49.079> looks<00:01:49.829> more

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
back then this to me looks more

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.389

head<00:04:09.700> like<00:04:09.880> right<00:04:09.910> here<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:11.110> almost<00:04:11.350> like

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
head like right here it's almost like

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.979 
head like right here it's almost like
it's<00:04:11.680> coming<00:04:11.980> up<00:04:12.160> like<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.970> then<00:04:13.870> it

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
it's coming up like this and then it

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.050 
it's coming up like this and then it
does<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.410> dip<00:04:14.800> real<00:04:15.070> quick<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.550> then<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.820> starts

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
does a dip real quick and then it starts

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.520 
does a dip real quick and then it starts
doing<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.479> so<00:04:17.410> try<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.620> get<00:04:17.890> that<00:04:18.160> move<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:18.910> be

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
doing that so try to get that move to be

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.990 
doing that so try to get that move to be
fluid<00:04:20.530> like<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.310> know<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.609> one<00:04:21.790> big

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
fluid like this you know just one big

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.150 
fluid like this you know just one big
fluid<00:04:22.390> art<00:04:22.570> all<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> way<00:04:23.080> through<00:04:23.290> so<00:04:23.950> check

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
fluid art all the way through so check

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.530 
fluid art all the way through so check
your<00:04:24.310> arcs<00:04:24.669> because<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:24.970> feel<00:04:25.150> like<00:04:25.300> there's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
your arcs because I feel like there's

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.080 
your arcs because I feel like there's
some<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:27.040> know<00:04:27.160> overall<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.669> think<00:04:28.000> you've

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
some you know overall I think you've

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.520 
some you know overall I think you've
done<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.240> good<00:04:28.419> job<00:04:28.479> but<00:04:28.870> there's<00:04:29.020> some<00:04:29.140> areas

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
done a good job but there's some areas

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.710 
done a good job but there's some areas
where<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:29.860> need<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.280> really<00:04:30.640> finesse<00:04:31.300> those

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
where you need to really finesse those

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.710 
where you need to really finesse those
arcs

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.330 

I'm<00:04:40.720> not<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.110> sure<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.380> this<00:04:41.680> backwards

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
I'm not so sure that this backwards

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.720 
I'm not so sure that this backwards
paddle<00:04:43.240> hand<00:04:43.450> is<00:04:43.630> working<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.380> feels<00:04:44.710> like<00:04:45.010> a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
paddle hand is working that feels like a

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.700 
paddle hand is working that feels like a
whip<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.750> he's<00:04:46.840> going<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.050> whip<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.470> there

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
whip that he's going to whip it on there

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.150 
whip that he's going to whip it on there
it<00:04:48.700> might<00:04:48.880> be<00:04:48.940> too<00:04:49.210> much<00:04:49.650> all<00:04:50.650> right<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:50.920> talked

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
it might be too much all right we talked

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.770 
it might be too much all right we talked
about<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.580> before<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.330> think<00:04:52.540> you<00:04:52.600> did<00:04:52.720> a

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
about this before and I think you did a

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.150 
about this before and I think you did a
much<00:04:52.960> better<00:04:53.140> job<00:04:53.580> where<00:04:54.580> now<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:56.110> force<00:04:56.440> that

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
much better job where now the force that

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.770 
much better job where now the force that
you're<00:04:57.310> pulling<00:04:57.700> back<00:04:57.730> in<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.150> different<00:04:58.540> pose

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
you're pulling back in a different pose

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.080 
you're pulling back in a different pose
his<00:04:59.140> butt<00:04:59.410> is<00:04:59.560> not<00:04:59.770> over<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.580> pulling<00:05:00.970> is

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
his butt is not over the pulling is

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.730 
his butt is not over the pulling is
what's<00:05:01.300> actually<00:05:01.480> going<00:05:01.870> this<00:05:02.020> way<00:05:02.200> but<00:05:02.560> the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
what's actually going this way but the

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.370 
what's actually going this way but the
force<00:05:03.010> of<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:04.000> feel<00:05:04.330> happening<00:05:05.170> all

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
force of that you feel happening all

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.110 
force of that you feel happening all
throughout<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.980> body<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.490> think<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.880> pose

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
throughout the body so I think this pose

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.940 
throughout the body so I think this pose
works<00:05:07.360> really<00:05:07.540> well<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:08.050> know<00:05:08.380> we<00:05:08.620> talked<00:05:08.830> about

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
works really well I know we talked about

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.160 
works really well I know we talked about
like<00:05:09.280> how<00:05:09.490> when<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.150> butt<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:10.570> like<00:05:10.720> coming<00:05:11.050> up

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
like how when the butt is like coming up

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.110 
like how when the butt is like coming up
and<00:05:11.380> pulling<00:05:11.590> this<00:05:11.830> way<00:05:12.040> we<00:05:12.220> feel<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.700> force

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
and pulling this way we feel that force

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.790 
and pulling this way we feel that force
but<00:05:13.420> I<00:05:13.450> think<00:05:13.690> this<00:05:13.870> pose<00:05:14.080> works<00:05:14.350> better<00:05:14.620> than

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
but I think this pose works better than

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.720 
but I think this pose works better than
what<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:14.980> had<00:05:15.100> before<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:16.920> like<00:05:17.920> the<00:05:18.130> the

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
what you had before I like the the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.000 
what you had before I like the the
accepting<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.960> weight<00:05:20.110> there<00:05:20.440> where<00:05:20.890> he

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
accepting of the weight there where he

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.640 
accepting of the weight there where he
pulls<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.430> up<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:24.360> like<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.660> texture<00:05:26.350> where

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
pulls it up I like the the texture where

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.290 
pulls it up I like the the texture where
he<00:05:26.710> goes<00:05:26.890> forward<00:05:27.370> really<00:05:27.580> quickly<00:05:28.060> there

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
he goes forward really quickly there

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.410 
he goes forward really quickly there
boom<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.860> boom<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.460> feels<00:05:30.880> really<00:05:31.180> heavy

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
boom and boom that feels really heavy

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.350 
boom and boom that feels really heavy
how<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:33.120> feel<00:05:34.120> it's<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.420> little<00:05:34.480> bit<00:05:34.960> noisy<00:05:35.230> and

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
how I feel it's a little bit noisy and

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.940 
how I feel it's a little bit noisy and
this<00:05:37.360> switching<00:05:39.420> and<00:05:40.420> it's<00:05:41.230> like<00:05:41.530> his<00:05:41.680> head<00:05:41.920> is

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
this switching and it's like his head is

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
this switching and it's like his head is
kind<00:05:42.280> of<00:05:42.480> wobbling

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
kind of wobbling

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.340 
kind of wobbling
do<00:05:45.970> you<00:05:46.030> see<00:05:46.150> what<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.300> mean<00:05:46.480> it's<00:05:46.750> going<00:05:46.930> back

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
do you see what I mean it's going back

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.800 
do you see what I mean it's going back
then<00:05:48.190> it<00:05:48.280> like<00:05:48.460> comes<00:05:48.790> down<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:49.510> then<00:05:49.630> goes

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
then it like comes down and then goes

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.180 
then it like comes down and then goes
back<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:50.080> little<00:05:50.350> bit<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.740> then<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:50.920> starts<00:05:51.130> to

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
back a little bit and then it starts to

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.850 
back a little bit and then it starts to
go<00:05:51.370> forward<00:05:51.790> there's<00:05:51.970> like<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> weird

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
go forward there's like a weird

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.510 
go forward there's like a weird
trajectory<00:05:53.860> in<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.130> head<00:05:54.310> there<00:05:56.520> so

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
trajectory in the head there so

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.590 
trajectory in the head there so
everything's<00:05:58.000> fine

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
everything's fine

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.780 
everything's fine
back<00:05:59.230> and<00:05:59.530> then<00:05:59.740> as<00:05:59.860> you<00:06:00.040> start<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.370> get<00:06:00.550> back

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
back and then as you start to get back

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:08.130 
back and then as you start to get back
here<00:06:01.260> let's<00:06:02.260> use<00:06:02.470> this<00:06:06.900> so<00:06:07.900> we're<00:06:08.020> moving

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
here let's use this so we're moving

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.590 
here let's use this so we're moving
backwards<00:06:08.830> right<00:06:10.950> we<00:06:11.950> stop<00:06:12.280> we<00:06:13.030> start<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.390> come

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
backwards right we stop we start to come

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.890 
backwards right we stop we start to come
forward<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.200> down<00:06:15.450> and<00:06:16.500> straight<00:06:17.500> down<00:06:17.740> and

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
forward and down and straight down and

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.670 
forward and down and straight down and
then<00:06:19.900> back<00:06:20.260> again<00:06:20.470> right<00:06:20.800> here<00:06:21.130> and<00:06:22.290> then<00:06:23.290> back

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
then back again right here and then back
