00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 I'll show you today how he wears a cap 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 knitting pattern in Bern can I do 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.040
 yes not very happy with samples 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.990
 That's why I'm going to cap with one 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 Start air wash chain 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.380
 so I save myself either 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.230
 double knit or even that 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 unloved mesh so i hit one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.140
 just mesh and number air masses 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 so crochet so many air masses until the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.750
 chain well around your head it fits today 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.880
 not to go there so should 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.820
 not too tense and not too excited 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.460
 loose minister as far as time closes the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.460
 round with a chain stitch 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.370
 I just pull the wool through 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.800
 because I later thread the same 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.680
 then I 'll spare myself 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.430
 namely a family good now bad 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.739
 in a stitch and picks up the thread 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.790
 so do not have to come into a contrast 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.449
 make that 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.180
 I have easily done in order 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.479
 he sees it better I get through each one 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.620
 air mass and put it on a thread 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.860
 my and knitting needle where he goes 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.520
 is to her by the way not so important on 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.670
 best but he does it to always equal 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.590
 hitler the cap then you see 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.470
 not anymore if I'm up or down 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.150
 because I'm gonna do that 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.230
 just girls 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.260
 I have taken enough stitches 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.330
 but my knitting needle is kinda too 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.990
 that's why I'm going with one 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.970
 carry on smaller with smaller ones 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.250
 Needle lace and be shorter if you like 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.500
 that can not or if it is something like that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.810
 you can not have it at home either 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 with the needle game or with one 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.560
 You continue to do this by half 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 just fold the stitches and pull the rope 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.780
 from around knitting needle just by me 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.140
 I made a video about it 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 and then just a few strict 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.050
 for centimeters always one stitch left 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.780
 and a stitch right we knit that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.120
 pattern and that's what you get 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.459
 few centimeters depending for less 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.480
 that makes for adult offers year 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.750
 of course, a little bit longer then 55 cm for 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.780
 small children two to three centimeters 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.850
 So you have to think for yourself 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.660
 who that is and how long this is 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.690
 should be 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.990
 my alliances long enough we need 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.960
 but an odd number because of that 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.610
 I double the first stitch 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.310
 I knit quite normal right-hand stitch 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.500
 let the loop on the needle there 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.770
 the flags and knit one more 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.000
 left loop first such loop 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.270
 out and then comes a left at it 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.760
 I make a right on mesh over it 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.870
 right a left over the left 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.460
 right and I do that all round 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.280
 I have an odd one right now 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.470
 stitch number and do not need me 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.590
 continue to remember where the beginning is 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.870
 I can just keep knitting as 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.640
 a missing person always changes 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.290
 left and right stitches 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.280
 not only next to each other, too 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.800
 on top of each other and once my cap now 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.230
 long enough and I with the decreases 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.920
 I can start again 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.920
 notify you 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.760
 my cap is long enough and me 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.239
 I will start with the acceptance 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.370
 I have a stitch on four sides 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.340
 Markers made 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.209
 I now take each one of the company 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.940
 taste of her two stitches that is 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.239
 I knit three stitches together 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.099
 Here is a right knit I three 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.310
 left together 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.799
 should be here with you a right left 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.729
 are knitted three stitches on the right 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.549
 together 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.170
 Of course you do that with all company 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.940
 taste of her 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.650
 then knit a round without 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.110
 Decreases that is a round only in the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.980
 normal by had to continue knitting 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.740
 In the next round we are now strict 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.890
 so you can march between them 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.570
 Markers three mesh together so 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.570
 strictly to the point 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.610
 until about mid-way and then you stretch 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.490
 three stitches together 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.410
 I prefer to knit left together 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.200
 easier because of that I put again 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.310
 here three left together because here one 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.170
 left mesh also belongs and that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.850
 made him between every taste 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:12.450
 her he just knits a round again 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.610
 in bern is easy without declines 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.240
 knit over all the stitches again 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.620
 and then the decreases begin again 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.400
 to start at the beginning 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.070
 so again with every taste of her 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.750
 takes you three stitches so two stitches 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.730
 deterring three stitches together and 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.250
 always in the same pattern if one 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.190
 Right should come strictly right 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.260
 together and when a left come in 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.530
 The left stitch should come strictly 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.270
 the links together and the whole power 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.080
 for a very long time so far only eight to 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.409
 have twelve stitches left 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:59.409
 then she cuts off the thread and 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:04.460
 pulls the thread through every stitch 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:08.120
 So just go through it then you can 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.230
 you contract with them and the whole 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.650
 awarded on the inside 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.510
 I'll make a flower on it and 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.500
 I will still check the cap 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:25.140
 always sting at the girls and 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.390
 make two stitches 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.730
 I just like that better 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.210
 between the stitches 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:36.090
 So in each rib made two solid 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.510
 mesh into it so at the right 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.510
 mesh 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.980
 Finally, I have flowers 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.710
 crocheted up and now I have for 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.110
 my scarf a matching cap 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:58.570
 Have fun copying and me 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.570
 wish you a perfect day
