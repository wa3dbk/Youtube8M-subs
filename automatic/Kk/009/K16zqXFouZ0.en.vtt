00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
know there's only one way to learn and

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.910

it's it's tough as nails on all that and
for<00:01:47.200> ready<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.800> run<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.399> would<00:01:48.580> say<00:01:48.849> it

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
for ready to run I would say it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.930 
for ready to run I would say it
certainly<00:01:49.300> is<00:01:49.539> but<00:01:50.440> there<00:01:51.399> are<00:01:51.520> some<00:01:51.759> areas

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
certainly is but there are some areas

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.300 
certainly is but there are some areas
that<00:01:52.149> require<00:01:53.110> some<00:01:53.319> attention<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.979> that's

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
that require some attention and that's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.359 
that require some attention and that's
not<00:01:55.140> different<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.560> know<00:01:56.649> for<00:01:56.890> really<00:01:57.039> any

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
not different you know for really any

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
sort of RC car unless you get something

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.980 
sort of RC car unless you get something
you<00:01:59.890> know<00:02:00.369> very<00:02:00.550> high-end<00:02:01.330> such<00:02:01.690> as<00:02:01.869> this

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
you know very high-end such as this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.169 
you know very high-end such as this
monster<00:02:02.229> right<00:02:02.500> here<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:03.099> mean<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.550> was<00:02:03.910> twice

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
monster right here I mean this was twice

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.330 
monster right here I mean this was twice
as<00:02:04.420> expensive<00:02:04.660> but<00:02:05.500> it's<00:02:05.679> probably<00:02:06.039> three

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
as expensive but it's probably three

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.880 
as expensive but it's probably three
times<00:02:06.520> more<00:02:06.789> durable<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:08.020> this<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.530> indicate

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
times more durable is this to indicate

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.420 
times more durable is this to indicate
that<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.849> savage<00:02:10.330> can't<00:02:10.630> be<00:02:10.810> as<00:02:11.319> durable<00:02:11.980> of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
that the savage can't be as durable of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.870 
that the savage can't be as durable of
course<00:02:12.730> not<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.560> platform<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.220> noted<00:02:15.580> is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
course not the platform as I noted is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.420 
course not the platform as I noted is
extremely<00:02:16.690> popular<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.650> there's<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.920> lot<00:02:18.190> of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
extremely popular so there's a lot of

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.770 
extremely popular so there's a lot of
different<00:02:18.670> parts<00:02:18.880> with<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.209> there's<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.420> lot<00:02:19.599> of

different parts with it there's a lot of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.640 
different parts with it there's a lot of
knowledge<00:02:20.530> sharing<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.670> vehicle<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.650> I'm

heard<00:03:06.660> four<00:03:06.930> millimeters<00:03:07.410> as<00:03:08.220> ideal<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.150> went

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
heard four millimeters as ideal I went

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.970 
heard four millimeters as ideal I went
ahead<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.870> set<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.290> about<00:03:10.440> 5<00:03:10.680> millimeters

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
ahead and set it to about 5 millimeters

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.830 
ahead and set it to about 5 millimeters
I'd<00:03:11.310> rather<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:12.030> millimeter<00:03:12.630> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
I'd rather have it a millimeter to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.660 
I'd rather have it a millimeter to
tighten<00:03:13.349> than<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> millimeter<00:03:13.890> not<00:03:14.489> tight

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.720 
tighten than a millimeter not tight
enough<00:03:14.790> next<00:03:15.569> thing<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.080> servo<00:03:16.980> horn

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
enough next thing is this servo horn

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.830 
enough next thing is this servo horn
right<00:03:17.970> here<00:03:18.180> I'm<00:03:18.330> gonna<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.600> ahead<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
right here I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.370 
right here I'm gonna go ahead and
replace<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:20.900> aluminum<00:03:21.900> one<00:03:22.049> then

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
replace it with a aluminum one then

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.559 
replace it with a aluminum one then
while<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> horn<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:23.010> threaded<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.790> went<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.450> and

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
while the horn is threaded I went in and

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.360 
while the horn is threaded I went in and
captured<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:25.019> with<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> nylon<00:03:25.380> nut<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.069> it's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
captured it with the nylon nut so it's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.220 
captured it with the nylon nut so it's
not<00:03:26.519> coming<00:03:26.849> off<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.480> additionally<00:03:28.080> I'm

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
not coming off now and additionally I'm

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.740 
not coming off now and additionally I'm
converting<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.920> screws<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.700> hex<00:03:30.030> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
converting all the screws to hex and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.539 
converting all the screws to hex and
using<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.140> tawny<00:03:31.319> screw<00:03:31.650> kit<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.310> decided

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
using the tawny screw kit so I decided

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.430 
using the tawny screw kit so I decided
to<00:03:32.640> go<00:03:32.730> ahead<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:32.970> switch<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.989> HD<00:03:34.319> out

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
to go ahead and switch to the HD out

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.800 
to go ahead and switch to the HD out

decided to replace these step screws
that<00:04:44.430> go<00:04:44.490> into<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.210> spindle<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.800> because

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
that go into the spindle just because

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.320 
that go into the spindle just because
you<00:04:47.250> can<00:04:47.370> tell<00:04:47.550> they're<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.760> part<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.000> wears

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
you can tell they're a part that wears

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.610 
you can tell they're a part that wears
they<00:04:48.690> bend<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.990> little<00:04:49.080> bit<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.500> they're

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
they bend a little bit and they're

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.070 
they bend a little bit and they're
definitely<00:04:49.770> starting<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.280> strip<00:04:50.550> out<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.990> of

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
definitely starting the strip out one of

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.260 
definitely starting the strip out one of
those<00:04:52.200> things<00:04:52.560> were<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.280> kind<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:53.970> helps<00:04:54.210> to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
those things were just kind of helps to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.020 
those things were just kind of helps to
keep<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.750> vehicle<00:04:54.900> polished<00:04:55.790> you<00:04:56.790> can<00:04:56.910> see

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
keep the vehicle polished you can see

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.490 
keep the vehicle polished you can see
there's<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.270> big<00:04:57.419> difference<00:04:57.540> in<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.930> new<00:04:57.990> ones

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
there's a big difference in the new ones

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.560 
there's a big difference in the new ones
now<00:04:58.950> we<00:04:59.010> begin<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.490> put<00:04:59.730> it<00:04:59.820> all<00:04:59.940> back<00:05:00.390> together

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
now we begin to put it all back together

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.310 
now we begin to put it all back together
again<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.440> do<00:05:01.860> have<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.220> very<00:05:03.320> sinking

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
again I do have this very sinking

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.610 
again I do have this very sinking
feeling<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:04.919> something's<00:05:05.460> just<00:05:05.730> not<00:05:05.820> right

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
feeling that something's just not right

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.590 
feeling that something's just not right
but<00:05:07.620> there's<00:05:07.980> only<00:05:08.130> one<00:05:08.250> way<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.640> find<00:05:08.910> out<00:05:09.150> and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
but there's only one way to find out and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.760 
but there's only one way to find out and
the<00:05:09.690> way<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.810> see<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.050> what's<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.530> worst<00:05:10.680> thing

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
the way I see it what's the worst thing

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.670 
the way I see it what's the worst thing
that'll<00:05:10.980> happen<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.520> put<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:11.880> back<00:05:11.940> together

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
that'll happen I put it back together

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.610 
that'll happen I put it back together
something<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.770> not<00:05:13.890> right<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:15.260> fix<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.410> I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
something is not right I fix it I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.980 
something is not right I fix it I
learned<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.580> love<00:05:17.850> love<00:05:18.210> love<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.810> fact

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
learned and I love love love the fact

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.200 
learned and I love love love the fact
I'm<00:05:19.200> converting<00:05:19.650> everything<00:05:20.190> from<00:05:21.120> standard

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
I'm converting everything from standard

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.390 
I'm converting everything from standard
to<00:05:24.210> hex<00:05:24.419> via<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.560> Toni<00:05:25.800> screws<00:05:26.160> getting

better<00:05:26.580> at<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.570> it's<00:05:27.990> all<00:05:28.110> about<00:05:28.260> learning

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
better at this it's all about learning

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.500 
better at this it's all about learning
the<00:05:28.650> design<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.370> learning<00:05:30.090> how<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.180> be<00:05:30.360> the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
the design and learning how to be the

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.000 
the design and learning how to be the
most<00:05:30.690> efficient<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:31.260> can<00:05:31.410> be<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:31.740> found

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
most efficient you can be and I found

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.520 
most efficient you can be and I found
different<00:05:32.669> things<00:05:32.900> where<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:33.930> stay<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.350> know

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
different things where I stay you know

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.840 
different things where I stay you know
if<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.890> did<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.130> that<00:05:35.280> way<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.490> would<00:05:35.669> have<00:05:35.760> been

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
if I did it that way I would have been

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.969 
if I did it that way I would have been
faster<00:05:36.120> but<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:37.260> got<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.470> be<00:05:37.560> very<00:05:37.590> very

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
faster but you got to be very very

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.400 
faster but you got to be very very
methodical<00:05:38.729> at<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.210> minimum<00:05:39.720> when<00:05:40.260> you're

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
methodical at a minimum when you're

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.790 
methodical at a minimum when you're
going<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:42.080> taking<00:05:43.080> stuff<00:05:43.290> apart<00:05:43.440> for<00:05:43.740> the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
going and taking stuff apart for the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.990 
going and taking stuff apart for the
very<00:05:43.950> first<00:05:44.070> now<00:05:44.370> what<00:05:44.520> we'll<00:05:44.640> do<00:05:44.760> is<00:05:44.880> we'll

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
very first now what we'll do is we'll

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.370 
very first now what we'll do is we'll
give<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.300> all-important<00:05:45.990> roll<00:05:46.440> test

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
give it the all-important roll test

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:03.070 
give it the all-important roll test
what<00:05:49.380> do<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.530> think<00:05:49.710> did<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:49.890> pass<00:05:53.570> Yes<00:05:54.570> No

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.600 

unfortunately<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.110> don't<00:06:04.229> have<00:06:04.499> footage<00:06:05.039> of<00:06:05.460> us

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
unfortunately I don't have footage of us

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.360 
unfortunately I don't have footage of us
running<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.150> but<00:06:06.300> we<00:06:06.419> took<00:06:06.780> it<00:06:06.840> out<00:06:07.050> to<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.370> to

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
running it but we took it out to the to

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.820 
running it but we took it out to the to
the<00:06:08.520> scene<00:06:09.240> of<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.449> crime<00:06:09.719> or<00:06:10.199> we<00:06:10.529> had<00:06:10.680> about

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
the scene of the crime or we had about

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.439 
the scene of the crime or we had about
last<00:06:11.069> time<00:06:11.310> that<00:06:11.430> Andrew<00:06:11.759> was<00:06:11.849> complaining

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
last time that Andrew was complaining

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.649 
last time that Andrew was complaining
this<00:06:12.599> sort<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:12.990> sucks<00:06:13.319> and<00:06:14.150> this<00:06:15.150> time<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.569> was

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
this sort of sucks and this time it was

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.050 
this sort of sucks and this time it was
a<00:06:15.689> whole<00:06:16.020> different<00:06:16.050> experience<00:06:16.620> it<00:06:17.430> ran<00:06:17.669> fine

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
a whole different experience it ran fine

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.670 
a whole different experience it ran fine
it<00:06:18.240> turned<00:06:18.599> well<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:20.370> weren't<00:06:21.560> flipping<00:06:22.560> over

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
it turned well you weren't flipping over

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.050 
it turned well you weren't flipping over
any<00:06:22.979> of<00:06:23.099> that<00:06:23.219> good<00:06:23.310> stuff<00:06:23.520> so<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:23.699> was<00:06:23.879> very

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
any of that good stuff so I was very

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.159 
any of that good stuff so I was very
satisfied<00:06:24.749> with<00:06:24.779> it

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
satisfied with it

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.290 
satisfied with it
however<00:06:25.499> there<00:06:25.620> are<00:06:25.680> two<00:06:25.889> very<00:06:26.759> small<00:06:26.999> issues

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
however there are two very small issues

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.629 
however there are two very small issues
first<00:06:27.539> one<00:06:27.659> is<00:06:27.779> I<00:06:27.870> keep<00:06:28.080> losing<00:06:28.409> it<00:06:29.219> section<00:06:29.550> on

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
first one is I keep losing it section on

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.390 
first one is I keep losing it section on
this<00:06:29.789> side<00:06:29.999> this<00:06:30.599> little<00:06:31.020> eclip<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:32.159> it's<00:06:32.310> no

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
this side this little eclip and it's no

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.800 
this side this little eclip and it's no
big<00:06:32.520> deal<00:06:32.669> I<00:06:32.699> mean<00:06:32.789> I've<00:06:33.120> got<00:06:33.270> others<00:06:33.479> I<00:06:33.689> guess

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
big deal I mean I've got others I guess

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.149 
big deal I mean I've got others I guess
what<00:06:34.050> was<00:06:34.139> concerning<00:06:34.469> is<00:06:34.770> I<00:06:34.830> wasn't<00:06:35.069> even

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
what was concerning is I wasn't even

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.950 
what was concerning is I wasn't even
bashing<00:06:35.400> and<00:06:35.759> it<00:06:35.849> came<00:06:36.000> out<00:06:36.180> somehow<00:06:36.509> I've

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
bashing and it came out somehow I've

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.200 
bashing and it came out somehow I've
also<00:06:37.139> learned<00:06:37.529> that<00:06:37.680> either<00:06:38.069> there's<00:06:38.370> thick

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
also learned that either there's thick

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.089 
also learned that either there's thick
ones<00:06:39.449> and<00:06:39.659> thin<00:06:39.810> ones<00:06:40.050> or<00:06:40.319> they<00:06:40.529> begin<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:40.919> wear

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
ones and thin ones or they begin to wear

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.040 
ones and thin ones or they begin to wear
so<00:06:41.729> I<00:06:41.759> put<00:06:41.969> a<00:06:42.000> brand<00:06:42.240> new<00:06:42.330> one<00:06:42.509> in<00:06:42.629> it<00:06:42.750> we'll<00:06:42.930> see

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
so I put a brand new one in it we'll see

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.390 
so I put a brand new one in it we'll see
if<00:06:43.139> it<00:06:43.229> holds<00:06:43.289> up<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.889> other<00:06:44.039> side<00:06:44.250> of<00:06:44.340> the

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
if it holds up the other side of the

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.790 
if it holds up the other side of the
equation<00:06:44.819> is<00:06:44.969> shifting<00:06:45.449> it<00:06:46.259> was<00:06:46.409> shifting

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
equation is shifting it was shifting

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.050 
equation is shifting it was shifting
when<00:06:46.889> I<00:06:46.919> took<00:06:47.129> it<00:06:47.279> out<00:06:47.370> you<00:06:47.610> know<00:06:47.669> on<00:06:47.969> the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
when I took it out you know on the

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.550 
when I took it out you know on the
street<00:06:48.300> before<00:06:48.479> you<00:06:48.689> went<00:06:48.840> out<00:06:48.900> to<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.229> to<00:06:49.469> the

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
street before you went out to the to the

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.350 
street before you went out to the to the
field<00:06:49.830> when<00:06:50.460> I<00:06:50.520> got<00:06:50.639> out<00:06:50.759> there<00:06:50.969> I'm<00:06:51.029> pretty

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
field when I got out there I'm pretty

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.059 
field when I got out there I'm pretty
sure<00:06:51.539> it<00:06:51.629> wasn't<00:06:51.810> shifting<00:06:52.110> what<00:06:52.710> he<00:06:52.770> thinks

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
sure it wasn't shifting what he thinks

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.540 
sure it wasn't shifting what he thinks
happening<00:06:53.460> is<00:06:53.580> it's<00:06:53.759> shifting<00:06:54.150> so<00:06:54.479> early<00:06:54.870> and

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
happening is it's shifting so early and

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.100 
happening is it's shifting so early and
when<00:06:56.550> it's<00:06:56.669> on<00:06:56.759> grass<00:06:57.029> it<00:06:57.389> has<00:06:57.539> to<00:06:57.810> you<00:06:58.080> know

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
when it's on grass it has to you know

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.980 
when it's on grass it has to you know
accelerate<00:06:58.650> its<00:06:58.770> rpms<00:06:59.159> so<00:06:59.460> it's<00:07:00.389> shifting<00:07:00.749> so

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
accelerate its rpms so it's shifting so

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.300 
accelerate its rpms so it's shifting so
quickly<00:07:01.349> I'm<00:07:01.439> unable<00:07:01.560> to<00:07:01.680> even<00:07:01.919> hear<00:07:02.159> it

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
quickly I'm unable to even hear it

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.829 
quickly I'm unable to even hear it
we're<00:07:02.729> gonna<00:07:02.849> fix<00:07:03.029> that<00:07:03.240> and<00:07:03.479> then<00:07:03.539> finally

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:03.839 
we're gonna fix that and then finally

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:06.170 
we're gonna fix that and then finally
after<00:07:04.110> running<00:07:04.409> it<00:07:04.529> on<00:07:04.650> the<00:07:04.680> street<00:07:05.069> I<00:07:05.430> found

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
after running it on the street I found

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.559 
after running it on the street I found
this<00:07:06.770> little<00:07:07.770> concerning<00:07:08.370> however<00:07:09.240> I<00:07:09.330> looked

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:09.569 
this little concerning however I looked

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.659 
this little concerning however I looked
around<00:07:09.719> I<00:07:09.990> don't<00:07:10.169> see<00:07:10.319> any<00:07:10.469> missing<00:07:10.800> screws<00:07:11.039> so

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
around I don't see any missing screws so

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.040 
around I don't see any missing screws so
my<00:07:11.759> thought<00:07:11.939> is<00:07:12.120> when<00:07:12.389> I<00:07:12.419> was<00:07:12.569> converting

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
my thought is when I was converting

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.510 
my thought is when I was converting
these<00:07:13.169> two<00:07:13.409> hex<00:07:13.589> one<00:07:13.860> of<00:07:13.979> these<00:07:14.099> just<00:07:14.400> might

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
these two hex one of these just might

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.610 
these two hex one of these just might
have<00:07:14.669> fallen<00:07:14.879> down<00:07:15.120> somewhere<00:07:15.539> and<00:07:15.599> just<00:07:16.289> came

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
have fallen down somewhere and just came

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.439 
have fallen down somewhere and just came
out<00:07:16.800> when<00:07:16.949> I<00:07:16.979> started<00:07:17.219> driving<00:07:17.550> it<00:07:17.639> so<00:07:18.149> coming

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.449 
out when I started driving it so coming

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.420 
out when I started driving it so coming
up<00:07:18.539> in<00:07:18.659> subsequent<00:07:18.990> videos<00:07:19.409> what<00:07:20.219> I'm<00:07:20.310> gonna

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
up in subsequent videos what I'm gonna

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.089 
up in subsequent videos what I'm gonna
do<00:07:20.610> is<00:07:20.819> begin<00:07:21.240> putting<00:07:22.050> it<00:07:22.229> to<00:07:22.319> the<00:07:22.349> test<00:07:22.469> and

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 
do is begin putting it to the test and

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.969 
do is begin putting it to the test and
by<00:07:23.219> that<00:07:23.399> we're<00:07:23.789> gonna<00:07:23.909> start<00:07:24.270> with<00:07:24.979> wheelies

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 
by that we're gonna start with wheelies

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.279 
by that we're gonna start with wheelies
testing<00:07:26.819> out<00:07:26.939> you<00:07:27.539> know<00:07:27.629> how<00:07:27.810> well<00:07:27.990> I<00:07:28.020> can<00:07:28.139> do

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289 
testing out you know how well I can do

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.670 
testing out you know how well I can do
wheelies<00:07:28.589> with<00:07:28.770> it<00:07:29.029> then<00:07:30.029> after<00:07:30.300> that<00:07:30.680> jumps

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
wheelies with it then after that jumps

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.529 
wheelies with it then after that jumps
I'm<00:07:32.009> gonna<00:07:32.159> put<00:07:32.310> it<00:07:32.399> on<00:07:32.460> the<00:07:32.550> ramp<00:07:32.759> we're<00:07:33.419> gonna

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 
I'm gonna put it on the ramp we're gonna

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.139 
I'm gonna put it on the ramp we're gonna
see<00:07:33.719> how<00:07:33.810> well<00:07:34.020> it<00:07:34.349> can<00:07:34.379> handle<00:07:34.589> jumps<00:07:35.149> after

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:36.149 
see how well it can handle jumps after

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:38.450 
see how well it can handle jumps after
that<00:07:36.449> off-road<00:07:37.379> track<00:07:37.649> I'm<00:07:38.039> gonna<00:07:38.189> put<00:07:38.310> it<00:07:38.399> in

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
that off-road track I'm gonna put it in

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.029 
that off-road track I'm gonna put it in
its<00:07:38.699> track<00:07:39.120> mode<00:07:39.389> and<00:07:39.689> then<00:07:40.319> the<00:07:40.620> final<00:07:40.889> one

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 
its track mode and then the final one

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.110 
its track mode and then the final one
will<00:07:41.219> be<00:07:41.659> extreme<00:07:42.659> -<00:07:42.839> and<00:07:43.409> as<00:07:43.589> it<00:07:43.770> passes<00:07:44.159> its

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
will be extreme - and as it passes its

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.899 
will be extreme - and as it passes its
various<00:07:45.539> tests<00:07:45.870> and<00:07:46.080> I'm<00:07:46.139> satisfied<00:07:46.379> with<00:07:46.710> it

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:46.909 
various tests and I'm satisfied with it

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:50.389 
various tests and I'm satisfied with it
the<00:07:47.909> reward<00:07:48.270> will<00:07:48.419> be<00:07:48.449> new<00:07:49.169> bodies<00:07:49.500> because

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:50.399 
the reward will be new bodies because

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.159 
the reward will be new bodies because
this<00:07:50.520> one<00:07:50.669> here<00:07:50.789> is<00:07:50.849> pretty<00:07:50.969> much<00:07:51.180> had<00:07:51.360> it<00:07:51.389> so<00:07:51.899> I

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169 
this one here is pretty much had it so I

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.619 
this one here is pretty much had it so I
have<00:07:52.469> a<00:07:52.500> body<00:07:52.740> for<00:07:52.830> it<00:07:53.159> for<00:07:53.819> its<00:07:53.939> on-road<00:07:54.360> mode

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:54.629 
have a body for it for its on-road mode

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.269 
have a body for it for its on-road mode
it's<00:07:54.960> Street<00:07:55.139> running<00:07:55.319> Road<00:07:55.500> and<00:07:55.860> then<00:07:56.099> I<00:07:56.129> have

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:56.279 
it's Street running Road and then I have

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.909 
it's Street running Road and then I have
one<00:07:56.520> for<00:07:56.759> its<00:07:56.909> off-road<00:07:57.149> mode<00:07:57.449> but<00:07:58.199> I'm<00:07:58.800> not

00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 
one for its off-road mode but I'm not

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.800 
one for its off-road mode but I'm not
gonna<00:07:59.099> put<00:07:59.310> it<00:07:59.399> on<00:07:59.520> until<00:07:59.849> it<00:08:00.240> actually<00:08:00.270> earns

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:00.810 
gonna put it on until it actually earns
