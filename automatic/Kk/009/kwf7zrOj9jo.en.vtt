number one knowing how to start most

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.780 
number one knowing how to start most
important<00:01:09.799> thing<00:01:10.009> is<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:10.190> knowing<00:01:10.580> that<00:01:10.610> it

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
important thing is just knowing that it

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.810 
important thing is just knowing that it
starts<00:01:11.119> with<00:01:11.180> an<00:01:11.360> up<00:01:11.630> stroke<00:01:12.619> we<00:01:13.400> don't<00:01:13.670> want

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
starts with an up stroke we don't want

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.639 
starts with an up stroke we don't want
to<00:01:13.880> start<00:01:14.119> down<00:01:14.330> because<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.020> just<00:01:15.229> throws<00:01:15.470> off

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
to start down because it just throws off

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.760 
to start down because it just throws off
the<00:01:15.680> whole<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:17.360> just<00:01:17.540> throws<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.110> off<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.710> if

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
the whole it just throws it off so if

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.830 
the whole it just throws it off so if
you'll<00:01:18.890> start<00:01:19.190> with<00:01:19.310> an<00:01:19.460> up<00:01:19.610> stroke<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.630> helps

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
you'll start with an up stroke it helps

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.780 
you'll start with an up stroke it helps
you<00:01:20.930> stay<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.229> beat<00:01:21.530> helps<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.280> stay<00:01:22.460> on<00:01:22.490> time

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
you stay on beat helps you stay on time

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.930 
you stay on beat helps you stay on time
and<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.899> just<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.500> will<00:01:24.680> flow<00:01:24.979> naturally<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
and it just it will flow naturally the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.580 
and it just it will flow naturally the
second<00:01:26.300> thing<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:26.630> recognized<00:01:27.080> as<00:01:27.229> when<00:01:27.440> we're

fourth finger
don't<00:03:13.510> try<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.750> start<00:03:13.989> anywhere<00:03:14.349> else<00:03:14.530> because

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
don't try to start anywhere else because

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.830 
don't try to start anywhere else because
it's<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.459> fast<00:03:15.730> pattern<00:03:16.269> when<00:03:16.420> you're<00:03:16.540> playing

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840

it's a fast pattern when you're playing
this<00:03:16.959> at<00:03:17.110> full<00:03:17.260> speed<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.830> this<00:03:18.580> sets<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.910> up

this at full speed and this sets you up

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.240 
this at full speed and this sets you up
for<00:03:19.060> success<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.810> start<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.680> fourth<00:03:21.040> I'm

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
for success so start with a fourth I'm

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:31.220 
for success so start with a fourth I'm
gonna<00:03:21.400> play<00:03:21.549> through<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.849> then<00:03:22.030> explain<00:03:22.420> it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.600 

all<00:03:32.230> right<00:03:32.380> that's<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.890> whole<00:03:33.099> thing<00:03:33.310> of

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
all right that's the whole thing of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:41.460 
all right that's the whole thing of
course<00:03:34.480> it's<00:03:34.630> much<00:03:34.780> faster<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.319> way<00:03:41.410> to

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
course it's much faster so the way to

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920 
course it's much faster so the way to
learn<00:03:41.799> learn<00:03:42.670> at<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:43.000> speed<00:03:43.329> as<00:03:43.569> you<00:03:43.599> start

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
learn learn at that speed as you start

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.740 
learn learn at that speed as you start
slow<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.560> really<00:03:45.459> master<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.480> first

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
slow and really master this this first

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.690 
slow and really master this this first
half<00:03:46.989> again<00:03:47.889> you<00:03:48.010> start<00:03:48.220> on<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.430> fourth

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
half again you start on the fourth

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.759 
half again you start on the fourth
you're<00:03:49.389> playing<00:03:49.660> an<00:03:50.609> d<00:03:51.609> sharp<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.720> B<00:03:53.350> with

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
you're playing an d sharp and B with

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.280 
you're playing an d sharp and B with
your<00:03:53.799> forefinger<00:03:54.489> on<00:03:54.639> the<00:03:54.850> E<00:03:54.880> string<00:03:55.290> then

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
your forefinger on the E string then

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.690 
your forefinger on the E string then
this<00:03:57.190> little<00:03:57.489> triplet<00:03:58.060> you'll<00:03:58.540> go<00:03:58.840> G<00:03:59.470> sharp

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
this little triplet you'll go G sharp

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.890 
this little triplet you'll go G sharp
c-sharp<00:04:02.510> back<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.739> G<00:04:03.980> sharp<00:04:04.569> once<00:04:05.569> you<00:04:05.690> learn

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
c-sharp back to G sharp once you learn

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.600 
c-sharp back to G sharp once you learn
that<00:04:05.930> pattern

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.770 

I<00:04:10.840> could<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:11.989> do<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:12.170> over<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.530> over<00:04:13.780> speed

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
I could just do it over and over speed

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.990 
I could just do it over and over speed
it<00:04:14.900> up<00:04:18.340> all<00:04:19.340> right<00:04:19.459> once<00:04:19.699> you<00:04:19.760> learn<00:04:19.970> that

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
it up all right once you learn that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.140 
it up all right once you learn that
pattern<00:04:20.650> then<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.949> double<00:04:22.490> hits<00:04:22.760> at<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.910> end

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
pattern then the double hits at the end

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.840 
pattern then the double hits at the end
are<00:04:23.300> easy<00:04:27.190> all<00:04:28.190> right

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
are easy all right

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.790 
are easy all right
one<00:04:29.210> important<00:04:29.780> note<00:04:29.810> especially<00:04:30.080> for

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
one important note especially for

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.680 
one important note especially for
guitars<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.580> bass<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:31.910> we're<00:04:32.270> gonna<00:04:32.360> kill

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
guitars and bass is we're gonna kill

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.320 
guitars and bass is we're gonna kill
that<00:04:32.949> it's<00:04:33.949> not<00:04:34.130> just<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.400> dead<00:04:34.610> stop<00:04:34.970> when<00:04:35.240> we

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
that it's not just a dead stop when we

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.900 
that it's not just a dead stop when we
do<00:04:35.449> those<00:04:37.750> all<00:04:38.750> right
