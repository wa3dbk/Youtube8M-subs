00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:13.290
 some features 5 that are thrown 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 usually omitted in reviews let's say here 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.170
 It looks like an advertising offer from 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.630
 amazon companies when 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.910
 fall in reviews is the ability to choose 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.390
 they can be found on the internet here are particular 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:10.110
 I chose a large English-Russian dictionary and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 then when moving through the text 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.160
 the cursor below we see appears 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 proposed translation of this word we 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.520

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 features 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.140
 threw 5 and 4 of course just because 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.670
 I already have 5 I think buying 4 is meaningless 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.670
