00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
can see the on the boxes for packing and

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.840 
can see the on the boxes for packing and
these<00:00:22.940> are<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.470> me<00:00:24.470> see<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.070> he<00:00:25.220> sings<00:00:27.850> that's

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
these are the me see the he sings that's

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.959 
these are the me see the he sings that's
that<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:33.230> is<00:00:33.530> gonna<00:00:33.890> be<00:00:34.129> our<00:00:34.160> fabrication

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
that this is gonna be our fabrication

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.229 
that this is gonna be our fabrication
part<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:36.320> they're<00:00:36.649> drilling<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.730> hissings

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
part that they're drilling the hissings

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.889 
part that they're drilling the hissings
and<00:00:38.629> stuff<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.469> that's<00:00:40.280> our<00:00:40.579> CNC<00:00:41.480> machine

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
and stuff and that's our CNC machine

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.180 
and stuff and that's our CNC machine
over<00:00:42.800> here

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:59.900 

it's<00:00:48.060> getting<00:00:48.360> too<00:00:48.570> dark<00:00:48.810> here<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:50.220> but

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000 

I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.450> this<00:01:00.630> was<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.900> he<00:01:01.440> Singh<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I think this was the he Singh that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
I think this was the he Singh that
freaking<00:01:02.489> catalyst<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.180> last<00:01:03.450> time<00:01:03.630> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
freaking catalyst here last time that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.280 
freaking catalyst here last time that
took<00:01:04.260> picture<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.750> supposed<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
took picture of and it was supposed to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.700 
took picture of and it was supposed to
work<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.920> blade<00:01:08.160> but<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.700> since

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
work for one blade but then since

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.170 
work for one blade but then since
difficulty<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.770> jumping<00:01:11.190> up<00:01:11.370> so<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
difficulty is jumping up so we kind of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.750 
difficulty is jumping up so we kind of
domed<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.960> design<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:13.440> we<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:14.460> whole<00:01:14.610> bunch

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
domed this design so we got whole bunch

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.280 
domed this design so we got whole bunch
of<00:01:14.880> aluminum<00:01:15.420> sitting<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:18.140> walking<00:01:19.140> on

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
of aluminum sitting there and walking on

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
of aluminum sitting there and walking on
this<00:01:19.470> side<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.160> how<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:24.000> getting

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this side you can see how we are getting

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.469 
this side you can see how we are getting
the<00:01:24.710> components<00:01:25.710> ready<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.490> manufacturing<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the components ready for manufacturing I

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.380 
the components ready for manufacturing I
think<00:01:28.290> you've<00:01:28.440> seen<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.910> pictures

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
think you've seen these in pictures

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:40.670 
think you've seen these in pictures
before<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.490> saw<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> materials<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.750> making

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
before you saw the materials for making

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.450 
before you saw the materials for making
the<00:01:41.070> minor<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.840> PCB<00:01:42.840> board<00:01:43.220> getting<00:01:44.220> them

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the minor the PCB board getting them

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.800 
the minor the PCB board getting them
ready<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:48.119> testing<00:01:48.539> boards

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
ready and here are the testing boards

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.200 
ready and here are the testing boards
which<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.220> another<00:01:50.490> video<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:53.210> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
which I will have another video for this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.950 
which I will have another video for this
one<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.690> for<00:01:55.700> 16<00:01:56.700> chips<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.660> can<00:01:57.810> see

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
one that's for 16 chips and you can see

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.800 
one that's for 16 chips and you can see
the<00:01:58.080> LED

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.230 

that's<00:02:03.530> for<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.920> test<00:02:04.280> machine<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.120> we

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
that's for the test machine that that we

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.290 
that's for the test machine that that we
have

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.970 

it's<00:02:10.300> only<00:02:10.450> running<00:02:10.750> at<00:02:10.960> one-for-one<00:02:11.740> Blaine

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's only running at one-for-one Blaine

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:26.620 
it's only running at one-for-one Blaine
now<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.830> here<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.000> our<00:02:16.500> burning<00:02:17.500> room

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.340 

darn<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.020> long<00:02:28.260> yeah<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.870> yeah<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.170> mean

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
darn so long yeah but yeah that mean

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.110 
darn so long yeah but yeah that mean
technically<00:02:31.860> sure<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:33.020> 50<00:02:34.020> Celsius

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
technically sure it's about 50 Celsius

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.140 
technically sure it's about 50 Celsius
so<00:02:36.120> yeah<00:02:37.010> every<00:02:38.010> machine<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.550> goes<00:02:38.910> out

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
so yeah every machine that goes out

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.260 
so yeah every machine that goes out
about<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> door<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.740> would<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.730> sitting<00:02:42.150> here

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
about a door it would be sitting here

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.190 
about a door it would be sitting here
for<00:02:42.710> 24<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.890> 48<00:02:44.220> hours<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:45.450> make<00:02:45.600> sure<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.020> it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
for 24 to 48 hours to make sure that it

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.170 
for 24 to 48 hours to make sure that it
works<00:02:46.410> properly<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.790> gonna<00:02:47.940> be

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
works properly and then it's gonna be

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.520 
works properly and then it's gonna be
packed<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.660> shipped<00:02:48.870> out

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.680 

so<00:02:52.530> here<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:53.130> have<00:02:53.340> two<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.150> testing

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
so here we have two of the testing

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770 
so here we have two of the testing
boards<00:02:55.140> now<00:02:55.740> running<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.210> been<00:02:57.480> running

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
boards now running we have been running

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.320 
boards now running we have been running
them<00:02:57.960> since<00:02:58.380> 1:00<00:02:59.100> p.m.<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.610> afternoon<00:02:59.790> and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
them since 1:00 p.m. this afternoon and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.710 
them since 1:00 p.m. this afternoon and
let's<00:03:01.290> check<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:02.010> numbers<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.250> it's

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
let's check it the numbers this one it's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.810 
let's check it the numbers this one it's
connected<00:03:06.830> not<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.980> whole<00:03:08.130> thing<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.460> running

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
connected not the whole thing is running

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.870 
connected not the whole thing is running
it's<00:03:09.060> only<00:03:09.270> running<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.840> one<00:03:10.110> blade<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:11.610> let's

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it's only running of one blade so let's

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.070 
it's only running of one blade so let's
look<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.330> numbers<00:03:12.690> now<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:15.210> don't<00:03:15.750> know<00:03:15.930> if

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
look at the numbers now I don't know if

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.790
