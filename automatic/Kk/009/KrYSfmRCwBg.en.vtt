 ah 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.360
 over sheer software the studio 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 independent of starbreeze studios 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.070
 again offer us cooperative action to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.740
 piecework with the second installment of pay 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 day available for pre station 3 ipc 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.250
 also coming to xbox for the first time 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.120
 360 thanks to the change of distributor of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.339
 sony online to fire of fire games hoxton 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.559
 dallas world and james the four 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.540
 protagonists of the previous game have 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.479
 now more than thirty contracts 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.820
 at your disposal much more than 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.470
 the six of the first game without counting 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.650
 the downloadable maps that went 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.400
 adding later and esque payday 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.510
 2 offers much more fun 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.640
 personalization and news that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 they manage to place it as a product of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 the skin quite recommendable first thing 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.030
 that draws our attention to those who 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.680
 we played the previous installment turns out to be 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.740
 the one that we have now a kind of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.409
 headquarters a safe house in the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 we can practice our aim see 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.270
 our progress buy improvements and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.440
 Obviously accept the different 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 contracts through 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.930
 crime net where we are shown the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.400
 different missions to access 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.140
 as in the previous proposal we can 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.120
 face the different contracts of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.490
 individual way with classmates 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.300
 controlled by the cpu or form 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.770
 online cooperative going into action the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.500
 game mechanics remains the same 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.970
 meet the economic objectives that we 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.920
 motivate us to move by the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
 different scenarios and eliminate all 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 the enemies that make us to step e 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.500
 interact with certain parts of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.830
 scenario is to place explosives 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 activate drills open drawers and so on 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.110
 the advance is more complicated now besides 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 of offering armed enemies a lot 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 more insistent resistant and numerous 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 new factors have been added one of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.880
 they will be civilians a little more 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.740
 ready which can give the alarm 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.080
 at any time or react from 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.150
 unexpectedly what compels us to 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190
 be more aware of them the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.440
 cameras will also activate the state of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.600
 alert and certain actions could 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.450
 activate more or less alarms what we 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.710
 encourages better analysis of the situation and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.110
 look for the strategy 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.300
 more effective before putting the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 mask and enter the rag 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.050
 there is a random factor in the position 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.420
 of objects and enemies that guarantees 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.090
 also that every time we play a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.090
 contract the experience is totally 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.830
 other than buying new ones 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.330
 weapons with the money obtained will be 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.550
 possible to improve any of the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.860
 characters and go unfolding their own 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.930
 improvements tree we can also go 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.730
 customizing the different masks 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.980
 although the graphic section continues 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.409
 based on the diesel engine something that has 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.140
 outdated the finish continues to be 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.659
 remarkable the scenarios present a 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.349
 better design and finishing with more textures 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:17.170
 credits not so civilians whose appearance 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.709
 is far from the required standard are 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.040
 inexpressive and clumsy showing their 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.230
 behavior 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.209
 distraction and chaos are better 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.879
 represented thanks to some objects 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.400
 who receive scales explode or they 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:35.359
 deformation although neither vehicles nor walls 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.250
 for example get scratched something for your 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.260
 part the main characters also 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.680
 they have an improvable representation 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.840
 with somewhat robotic animations in this 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.879
 delivery there is more clipping and in some 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.090
 occasion we have seen even characters 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.639
 that levitate for a few seconds in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.859
 means of a shooting that the paragraph 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.230
 sound is pretty good with weapons that 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.470
 they sound almost correctly and voices in 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.639
 English that well interpreted 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.470
 accompanied by dynamic music that 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.600
 varies by region 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.910
 artificial intelligence is correct 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.130
 final arts but sometimes in a way 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.350
 Sporadic enemies and our 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.750
 comrades controlled by the cpu are 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.590
 they become exaggeratedly clumsy when they do not see 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.660
 the enemy and almost does not ask for them and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.090
 they play better cooperatively and this one 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.380
 delivery power matching 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.320
 making connections of players with 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.390
 levels of cynical experience them the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.870
 server is not always affordable to the 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.540
 first connection aspect pending 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.430
 absolution comb and 2 does not pretend to be the 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.530
 concerning gender and aspects 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.840
 improvements that we have indicated so 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.000
 show but its playability is so 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.430
 good and addictive that results in a product 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.820
 highly recommended for the faithful to the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.820
 shooters
