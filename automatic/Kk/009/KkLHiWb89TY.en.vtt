00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 can use sugar in what you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.060
 prefer and cinnamon then here we go to 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.060
 find the conversions meters 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.100
 they will need half a cup of milk 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.100
 almonds 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.650
 and let's put stevia taste have to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 go testing the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.850
 and we are going to put 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.430
 and a half teaspoon of 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.430
 and cinnamon 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.509
 so 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.070
 although it is not necessary because then the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.820
 method to do this side we're going to 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.820
 you pretty 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.640
 we already have the mixture and what they are going to 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.640
 to do is put it in a small bag 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.220
 of this if you need it in the background a 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.959
 large bag and a smaller one that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.790
 they have to close well because it is 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.100
 let's put this bag face that 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.100
 we just put the milk mixture 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.030
 and they close them well it has to be super 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.490
 closed because if you do not lack 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.390
 of the salt that there is 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.620
 in the sky 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.620
 they take the air 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.310
 then open let's put the room that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.310
 in 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.870
 and basically this method of doing 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.870
 frozen 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.510
 until the ice needs more energy 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.510
 of the environment to be able 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.420
 thawing that makes us have 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.610
 our side in sachet that is going to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.610
