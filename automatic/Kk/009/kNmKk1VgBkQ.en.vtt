00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.750 
Eggman zeg service to hit the wall well
this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.500> worse<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.460> mean<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.730> least

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
this is worse because I mean at least

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.990 
this is worse because I mean at least
walls<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.450> move<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:38.460> things<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
walls don't move but things that you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.470 
walls don't move but things that you
have<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> make<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.420> guy<00:00:39.629> hit<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:41.329> yeah<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
have to make this guy hit you yeah this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160 
have to make this guy hit you yeah this
is<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.780> oh<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.680> i<00:00:43.739> recommend<00:00:44.090> yeah<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is easy oh and i recommend yeah if you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.930 
is easy oh and i recommend yeah if you
bought<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> gems<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.430> sonic<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.820> should

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
bought all the gems for sonic I should

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
bought all the gems for sonic I should
probably<00:00:48.030> showcase<00:00:48.570> those<00:00:48.750> some<00:00:49.020> time<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:50.280> get

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
probably showcase those some time to get

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.470 
probably showcase those some time to get
the<00:00:50.760> red<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> slows<00:00:51.719> down<00:00:51.840> time

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
the red one because it slows down time

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
the red one because it slows down time
so<00:00:54.480> while<00:00:54.750> he's<00:00:54.930> jumping<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.860> time<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so while he's jumping you can time it to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
so while he's jumping you can time it to
grab<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.579> also

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
grab on to this one and then it also

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
grab on to this one and then it also
makes<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> easier<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.590> run<00:01:02.280> into

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
makes it easier to make them run into

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.710 
makes it easier to make them run into
stuff<00:01:02.789> oh<00:01:03.000> my<00:01:03.059> god<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.719> easy<00:01:04.610> see<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
stuff oh my god that was easy see it's a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.510 
stuff oh my god that was easy see it's a
lot<00:01:06.869> easier<00:01:06.900> although<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.430> was

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
lot easier although i think that was

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.890 
lot easier although i think that was
just<00:01:08.700> luck<00:01:08.880> so

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.910 

I<00:01:13.150> would<00:01:14.150> recommend<00:01:14.330> actually<00:01:15.080> getting<00:01:15.740> all

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
I would recommend actually getting all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.410 
I would recommend actually getting all
the<00:01:16.040> rig's<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:16.460> soon<00:01:16.580> as<00:01:16.670> possible<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.300> then

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
the rig's as soon as possible and then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.460 
the rig's as soon as possible and then
just<00:01:17.630> not<00:01:17.840> get<00:01:17.990> him<00:01:18.080> hit<00:01:18.760> yeah<00:01:19.780> because<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
just not get him hit yeah because in the

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.840 
just not get him hit yeah because in the
platforms<00:01:25.010> are<00:01:25.040> going<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.250> fall<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.700> i<00:01:25.820> can't

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.490 

just<00:04:05.640> go<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.060> farthest<00:04:06.390> corner<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
just go to the farthest corner of the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.369 
just go to the farthest corner of the
spot<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.159> owners<00:04:08.730> hang<00:04:08.879> stopping<00:04:09.379> it's

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
spot that the owners hang stopping it's

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.710 
spot that the owners hang stopping it's
a<00:04:11.120> reminiscent<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.390> egg<00:04:12.810> Genesis<00:04:13.409> and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
a reminiscent of the egg Genesis and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.030 
a reminiscent of the egg Genesis and
then<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.870> have<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.079> jump<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.440> hit<00:04:16.590> them<00:04:16.709> which

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
then you have to jump and hit them which

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.180 
then you have to jump and hit them which
is<00:04:17.160> reminiscent<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.840> many<00:04:18.840> other<00:04:19.260> sonic<00:04:19.979> games

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
is reminiscent of many other sonic games

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.450 
is reminiscent of many other sonic games
