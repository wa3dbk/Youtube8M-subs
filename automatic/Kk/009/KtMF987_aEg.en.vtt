00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi friends sometimes there are such cases 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 that seems to be ready for sighting and already 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.429
 gonna turn on the milling spindle 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.340
 machine but some inner voice 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.190
 says something is wrong and you fall 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 on from the Minky begin to overcome some 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.029
 doubts and you start looking for what not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 so did not squeeze that did not finish now 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.769
 will show 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 it means a short list of such things on 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.300
 who need to pay attention immediately we 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.030
 maybe don't worry about it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.180
 about the first thing to pay 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.680
 attention is how good u 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.129
 you have a milling spindle tool clamped 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.620
 machine if everything is good then we check 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.050
 how much detail do you have for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.079
 milling it may not necessarily 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.160
 be a vice it can be a principle 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 parts clamped with clips on 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.750
 dividing table 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.189
 head and so on 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.330
 next step you need to check not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.369
 do you have any of the innings included 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.600
 all leverage innings should be in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 neutral position 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.090
 if some feed is turned on her 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.159
 need to disable the next step 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.119
 need to check whether you hold out 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.460
 line of guides or vice versa 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.810
 be in your case the line should be 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.240
 clamped for some special work 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.259
 next is to check the purity of rotation 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 spindle spindle rotation direction and 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 what is your feed 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.060
 perhaps it is not worth the feed that you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.090
 necessary and with the inclusion of self-propelled 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.500
 you can certainly harm something 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.750
 it is also worth checking whether it happened 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.829
 spontaneous unscrewing lamb on 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.100
 limbach innings if you have installed 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.950
 some coordinates the loss of coordinates 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.829
 Of course this is a sad thing and will have 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.440
 growth enter the coordinates of the new well 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.310
 These are the main components on 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 which need 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.550
 notice significant 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.319
 components that can generally 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.940
 lead to some consequences but on 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.940
 that's all thank you for your attention goodbye
