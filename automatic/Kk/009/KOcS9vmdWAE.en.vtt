00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.250 
so I headed up to the mining country and
really<00:04:02.319> realized<00:04:02.709> early<00:04:03.069> on<00:04:03.099> that<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:04.510> miners

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
really realized early on that the miners

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.619 
really realized early on that the miners
left<00:04:05.409> behind<00:04:05.889> as<00:04:06.250> much<00:04:06.879> gold<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.299> probably

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
left behind as much gold and probably

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.199 
left behind as much gold and probably
more<00:04:07.930> still<00:04:08.230> up<00:04:08.409> there<00:04:08.669> in<00:04:09.669> deep<00:04:09.969> in<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
more still up there in deep in the

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.000 
more still up there in deep in the
ground<00:04:10.329> then<00:04:10.810> has<00:04:11.079> ever<00:04:11.230> taken<00:04:11.439> out<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.889> that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
ground then has ever taken out and that

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.399 
ground then has ever taken out and that
that's<00:04:12.129> a<00:04:12.549> fact<00:04:12.819> but<00:04:13.329> they<00:04:13.480> left<00:04:13.689> behind<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.290> lot

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
that's a fact but they left behind a lot

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.930 
that's a fact but they left behind a lot
of<00:04:14.470> gold<00:04:14.799> because<00:04:15.010> they<00:04:15.250> didn't<00:04:15.549> have<00:04:15.669> metal

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
of gold because they didn't have metal

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.270 
of gold because they didn't have metal
detectors<00:04:16.440> even<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> Chinese<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:18.010> mine<00:04:18.159> who

ground and they couldn't see to bud and

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.670 
ground and they couldn't see to bud and
I<00:04:23.949> found<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.610> 20-pound<00:04:25.599> piece<00:04:26.139> of<00:04:26.289> quartz<00:04:26.560> with

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
pretty well cleared this Creek out as I

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.260 
pretty well cleared this Creek out as I
understand<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.800> right<00:05:30.280> down<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.580> bedrock<00:05:30.759> but

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
understand it right down to bedrock but

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.570 
understand it right down to bedrock but
and<00:05:31.539> then<00:05:32.169> work<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.530> bedrock<00:05:32.919> in<00:05:33.129> from<00:05:33.430> the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
and then work the bedrock in from the

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.269 
and then work the bedrock in from the
center<00:05:34.240> into<00:05:34.479> the<00:05:34.509> bank<00:05:34.750> now<00:05:35.710> they<00:05:35.860> left<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.159> lot

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279

hundred percent there's a piece of

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.279 
hundred percent there's a piece of
bedrock<00:05:50.409> so<00:05:50.710> it's<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:50.889> good<00:05:51.039> place<00:05:52.289> after
