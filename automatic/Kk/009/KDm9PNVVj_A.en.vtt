first good thing about this phone is the
battery<00:00:30.420> life<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.109> getting

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
battery life that I was getting

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.959 
battery life that I was getting
though<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.800> used<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.610> 3<00:00:32.940> days

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
though I just used it for about 3 days

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.850 
though I just used it for about 3 days
the<00:00:33.540> battery<00:00:33.899> life<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.410> getting<00:00:34.680> was

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the battery life that I was getting was

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
the battery life that I was getting was
actually<00:00:35.219> very<00:00:35.640> good<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.809> did<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.079> my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
actually very good and I did all my

actually very good and I did all my
testing<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> single<00:00:38.129> sim<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> did<00:00:38.790> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
testing with a single sim but I did it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.569 
testing with a single sim but I did it
on<00:00:39.090> 4G<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.469> good<00:00:40.649> thing<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.190> even

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
on 4G and the good thing was that even

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
on 4G and the good thing was that even
on<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> 4G<00:00:42.239> connection<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.350> battery<00:00:43.649> life<00:00:43.829> was

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
on a 4G connection the battery life was

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.350 
on a 4G connection the battery life was
good<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> speeds<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.180> getting

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
good and the speeds that I was getting

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.950 
good and the speeds that I was getting
on<00:00:45.570> even<00:00:45.870> 4G<00:00:46.410> were<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.510> fact<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
on even 4G were pretty good in fact I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.240 
on even 4G were pretty good in fact I
got<00:00:49.110> pretty<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.559> speed<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.010> check<00:00:50.160> out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
got pretty good speed you can check out

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
got pretty good speed you can check out
the<00:00:50.370> unboxing<00:00:50.489> video<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.449> did<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the unboxing video that I did for this

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
the unboxing video that I did for this
device<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> also<00:00:53.280> did<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> 4G<00:00:54.090> speed

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
device in that I also did the 4G speed

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
device in that I also did the 4G speed
test<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.559> regarding<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
test so that is good regarding the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
test so that is good regarding the
display<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> display<00:00:56.940> quality<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.510> also

display the display quality is also
pretty<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> would<00:00:58.410> say<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> 720p

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
pretty good I would say it's a 720p

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
pretty good I would say it's a 720p
panel<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> 5-inch<00:01:00.750> screen<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.170> the

actually pretty decent it runs on the
Snapdragon<00:01:39.329> 410<00:01:39.570> chipset<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.500> overall<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
Snapdragon 410 chipset and overall I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
Snapdragon 410 chipset and overall I
would<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.729> runs<00:01:42.119> at<00:01:42.299> pretty<00:01:42.630> smooth<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
would say it runs at pretty smooth but

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
would say it runs at pretty smooth but
one<00:01:43.680> place<00:01:43.920> where<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> notice<00:01:44.729> minor<00:01:45.090> lack<00:01:45.540> was

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
one place where I notice minor lack was

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.330 
one place where I notice minor lack was
in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.890> dialer

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
in the dialer

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
in the dialer
when<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.149> dial<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> number<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> are

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
when you dial the number or when you are

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.039 
when you dial the number or when you are
searching<00:01:49.560> etc<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.820> sort<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.780> minor

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
searching etc there is sort of a minor

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.490 
searching etc there is sort of a minor
lot<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:53.159> noticed<00:01:53.869> also<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.439> we

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
lot that I have noticed also when we

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.630 
lot that I have noticed also when we
move<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> camera<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> front-facing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
move to the camera the front-facing

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
move to the camera the front-facing
camera<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> 5<00:01:57.840> megapixel<00:01:58.079> shooter<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
camera which is a 5 megapixel shooter is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
camera which is a 5 megapixel shooter is
pretty<00:01:59.759> decent<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.990> when<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> talk<00:02:01.860> about

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
pretty decent and when you talk about

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520 
pretty decent and when you talk about
this<00:02:02.189> cellular<00:02:02.640> call<00:02:02.969> quality<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
this cellular call quality here also I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.200 
this cellular call quality here also I
am<00:02:04.619> pretty<00:02:05.009> happy<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> would<00:02:05.640> say<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> cellular

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
am pretty happy I would say the cellular

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
am pretty happy I would say the cellular
call<00:02:06.509> quality<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.200> getting<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.829> also

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
call quality that I was getting is also

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639 
call quality that I was getting is also
excellent<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.170> corner<00:02:10.590> I'll

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
excellent but there is what corner I'll

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.170 
excellent but there is what corner I'll
talk<00:02:10.860> about<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
talk about that but

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.060 
talk about that but
again<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.630> said<00:02:12.690> 40<00:02:13.380> speeds<00:02:13.650> were<00:02:13.800> pretty

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
again as I said 40 speeds were pretty

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.190 
again as I said 40 speeds were pretty
girl<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:15.120> let's<00:02:15.360> talk<00:02:15.570> about<00:02:15.630> some<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
girl and now let's talk about some of

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.230 
girl and now let's talk about some of
the<00:02:16.320> quirks<00:02:16.560> or<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.310> things<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> didn't

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the quirks or the things that I didn't

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.350 
the quirks or the things that I didn't
like<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.710> first<00:02:19.890> thing<00:02:20.100> as<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.550> mentioned<00:02:20.970> was

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
like the first thing as I mentioned was

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.380 
like the first thing as I mentioned was
minor<00:02:21.930> lock<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> dialer<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
minor lock in the dialer the but the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.000 
minor lock in the dialer the but the
second<00:02:24.780> biggest<00:02:24.990> thing<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.500> annoying<00:02:25.800> me

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
second biggest thing that is annoying me

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.430 
second biggest thing that is annoying me
a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.970> device<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.050> proximity

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
a lot on this device is the proximity

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.150 
a lot on this device is the proximity
sensor<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.820> say<00:02:30.000> 70%<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> time<00:02:31.230> when

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
sensor I would say 70% of the time when

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.610 
sensor I would say 70% of the time when
I'm<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.430> call<00:02:32.700> or<00:02:32.850> etc<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.660> proximity<00:02:34.260> sensor

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
I'm on call or etc the proximity sensor

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.100 
I'm on call or etc the proximity sensor
is<00:02:34.950> acting<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.460> little<00:02:35.730> bit<00:02:35.850> funny<00:02:36.240> sometimes

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
is acting a little bit funny sometimes

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.230 
is acting a little bit funny sometimes
the<00:02:37.350> screens<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.800> simply<00:02:38.070> does<00:02:38.220> not<00:02:38.250> go<00:02:38.700> off<00:02:38.940> or

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
the screens is simply does not go off or

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.600 
the screens is simply does not go off or
it<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.660> gets<00:02:39.990> stuck<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.620> stuff<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.460> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
it just gets stuck and stuff like that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.120 
it just gets stuck and stuff like that
also<00:02:41.790> when<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> call<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:43.080> most<00:02:43.710> Android

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
also when we get a call on most Android

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.150 
also when we get a call on most Android
phones<00:02:44.190> when<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.880> get<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> call<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.890> screen

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
phones when we can get a call the screen

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.830 
phones when we can get a call the screen
lights<00:02:47.430> up<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.210> know<00:02:48.360> who<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.630> calling

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
lights up and you know who is calling

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.140 
lights up and you know who is calling

of now if that would be fixed by a
software<00:03:10.860> update<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.670> I'm<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:11.880> keeping<00:03:12.000> my

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.090 
software update so I'm just keeping my
fingers<00:03:12.300> crossed<00:03:12.750> regarding<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.380> but<00:03:13.860> that

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
fingers crossed regarding that but that

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.740 
fingers crossed regarding that but that
was<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.340> biggest<00:03:14.850> annoying<00:03:15.330> thing<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.720> I

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
was the biggest annoying thing that I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.940 
was the biggest annoying thing that I
had<00:03:16.020> with<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.350> device<00:03:16.590> that's<00:03:16.800> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
had with this device that's the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.400 
had with this device that's the
proximity<00:03:17.280> sensor<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.720> apart<00:03:19.200> from<00:03:19.260> that

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
proximity sensor but apart from that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.160 
proximity sensor but apart from that
other<00:03:19.890> minor<00:03:20.430> quibble<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.780> rear<00:03:21.930> facing

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
other minor quibble the rear facing

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.350 
other minor quibble the rear facing
camera<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> would<00:03:22.800> say<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.190> decent<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.330> not

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.650 
camera I would say is decent but not
that<00:03:24.990> great<00:03:25.430> outdoor<00:03:26.430> shots<00:03:26.700> are<00:03:26.940> decent<00:03:27.480> but

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
that great outdoor shots are decent but

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.180 
that great outdoor shots are decent but
when<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:27.990> move<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.320> indoor<00:03:28.950> lighting

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
conditions and in artificial light I

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.990 
conditions and in artificial light I
would<00:03:31.530> say<00:03:31.710> you've<00:03:32.040> got<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.280> be<00:03:32.340> very<00:03:32.670> careful

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
would say you've got to be very careful

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
would say you've got to be very careful
otherwise<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.870> pictures<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.380> come<00:03:34.560> out<00:03:34.710> to

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
otherwise the pictures can come out to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.800 
otherwise the pictures can come out to
be<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:35.010> little<00:03:35.160> blurry<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:36.210> again<00:03:36.480> considering

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
be a little blurry but again considering

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.300 
be a little blurry but again considering
the<00:03:36.930> price<00:03:37.170> point<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.680> device<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.100> would

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
the price point of this device I would

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.490 
the price point of this device I would
say<00:03:38.460> it's<00:03:38.700> okay<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.810> start<00:03:40.140> comparing

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
say it's okay but if we start comparing

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.220 
say it's okay but if we start comparing
I<00:03:40.740> would<00:03:40.890> say<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.190> redmi<00:03:41.520> 2<00:03:41.820> had<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> better

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
I would say the redmi 2 had a better
