been<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.460> good<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> me<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> ran<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.590> 34<00:00:31.590> s

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
been really good to me I ran it on 34 s

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.280 
been really good to me I ran it on 34 s
most<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> time<00:00:32.660> never<00:00:33.660> had<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> problem

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
most of the time never had a problem

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
most of the time never had a problem
they're<00:00:37.290> skinny<00:00:37.670> 34<00:00:38.670> s<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.600> worked<00:00:39.780> great

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
they're skinny 34 s but it worked great

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.680 
they're skinny 34 s but it worked great
offroad<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.550> put<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> little<00:00:42.120> too<00:00:42.420> much

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
offroad I think I put a little too much

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.650 
offroad I think I put a little too much
of<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:46.219> posi<00:00:47.219> additive<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> last<00:00:48.390> time

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
of the posi additive in it the last time

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
of the posi additive in it the last time
I<00:00:48.989> change<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> fluid<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> posi

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
I change the fluid because the posi

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.560 
I change the fluid because the posi
doesn't<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.449> seem<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> grab<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:54.360> could

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
doesn't really seem to grab that could

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
doesn't really seem to grab that could
be<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> reason<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.620> worn

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
be the reason or it could just be worn

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
be the reason or it could just be worn

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
in the posi not working great it's kind

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
in the posi not working great it's kind
of<00:01:13.650> time<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:16.430> as<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> may

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

remember

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.860 

we<00:01:22.750> got<00:01:22.900> this<00:01:23.050> 14<00:01:23.560> bolt<00:01:23.860> over<00:01:24.040> here<00:01:26.100> full<00:01:27.100> float

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
we got this 14 bolt over here full float

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.330 
we got this 14 bolt over here full float
last<00:01:28.870> video<00:01:29.230> I<00:01:29.290> put<00:01:29.530> up<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.770> think<00:01:29.830> was<00:01:30.160> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
last video I put up I think was the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.950 
last video I put up I think was the
shape<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.910> bottom<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.510> so<00:01:31.660> it's<00:01:31.810> all

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
shape in the bottom of it so it's all

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
done still that I drill out and tap

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.210 
done still that I drill out and tap

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
where the vent hose was because that

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.000

real<00:01:39.160> rusty<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:39.910> we're<00:01:40.000> going<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.210> cut<00:01:40.360> those

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
real rusty so we're going to cut those

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
we get the axle in because that's not

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.760 
we get the axle in because that's not
super<00:01:46.600> important<00:01:47.080> right<00:01:47.140> now<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:49.410> just<00:01:50.410> did<00:01:50.560> hub

super important right now I just did hub

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.420 
super important right now I just did hub
seals<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.280> this<00:01:51.430> side<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.270> have<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.630> off

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
but as you can see get our disc brake

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.310 
but as you can see get our disc brake
bracket<00:01:59.410> on<00:01:59.530> there<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:01.960> I'm<00:02:02.050> going<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.200> be

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
bracket on there so what I'm going to be

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.880 
bracket on there so what I'm going to be
doing<00:02:02.590> today<00:02:02.740> hopefully<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:04.560> ripping<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.649> 12

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
doing today hopefully is ripping the 12

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.780 
doing today hopefully is ripping the 12
bolts<00:02:06.190> out<00:02:06.750> putting<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:07.930> thing<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.790> got

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
bolts out putting this thing in I got

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.430 
bolts out putting this thing in I got
new<00:02:09.940> u-bolts<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.660> u-bolt<00:02:10.959> plates<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
new u-bolts and the u-bolt plates the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.140 
new u-bolts and the u-bolt plates the
correspond<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:12.250> axle<00:02:12.700> because<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
correspond with this axle because of the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.940 
correspond with this axle because of the
tube<00:02:13.420> itself<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.080> actually<00:02:14.500> bigger<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.770> think

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
tube itself is actually bigger I think

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.860 
tube itself is actually bigger I think
it's<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.100> three<00:02:15.340> inch<00:02:15.459> tube<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.239> need<00:02:19.570> bit

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
it's a three inch tube so you need bit

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's a three inch tube so you need bit
the<00:02:20.080> longer<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.560> bolts<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.160> need<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the longer you bolts and you need the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.460 
the longer you bolts and you need the
spring<00:02:22.150> plates<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.630> correspond<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.260> this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
spring plates that correspond with this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.340 
spring plates that correspond with this
axle<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.660> we're<00:02:25.750> going<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:26.020> putting<00:02:26.260> this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
axle so we're going to be putting this

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.229 
axle so we're going to be putting this
under<00:02:26.650> here<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.040> got<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> conversion<00:02:27.700> u-joint

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
under here I got a conversion u-joint

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.800 
under here I got a conversion u-joint
that<00:02:28.420> goes<00:02:28.570> from<00:02:28.690> 1310<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.590> 1350<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:31.450> match<00:02:31.600> up

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that goes from 1310 to 1350 to match up

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.330 
that goes from 1310 to 1350 to match up
with<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:31.959> yoke<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:36.239> cadillac<00:02:37.239> eldorado

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
with that yoke I have cadillac eldorado

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.780 
with that yoke I have cadillac eldorado

calipers<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.900> need<00:02:44.049> those<00:02:44.230> years<00:02:44.470> because

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
calipers you need those years because

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.800 
calipers you need those years because
