pretty quick if you're not careful as

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.039 
pretty quick if you're not careful as
some<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> them<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.179> really<00:00:12.540> good<00:00:12.750> crowd

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
some of them have really good crowd

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.959 
some of them have really good crowd
control<00:00:13.320> abilities<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.950> crazy<00:00:14.429> amounts<00:00:14.820> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
control abilities and crazy amounts of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.670 
control abilities and crazy amounts of
damage<00:00:15.330> over<00:00:15.570> time<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.379> slowly

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
damage over time that will just slowly

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.310 
damage over time that will just slowly
drain<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.400> into<00:00:18.060> your<00:00:18.330> dead<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.990> they've

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
drain you into your dead so they've

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.630 
drain you into your dead so they've
right<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> different<00:00:19.890> element<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
right a different element for the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.189 
right a different element for the
intestine<00:00:21.000> faction<00:00:21.510> instead<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.020> having

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
intestine faction instead of just having

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.590 
intestine faction instead of just having
the<00:00:22.380> mindless<00:00:22.710> chargers<00:00:23.279> while<00:00:23.850> doing<00:00:24.449> just

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the mindless chargers while doing just

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.759 
the mindless chargers while doing just
that<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.900> charging<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.380> at<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that just charging right at you and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.170 
that just charging right at you and
trying<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> melee<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.640> death<00:00:26.849> where<00:00:27.119> you

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
trying to melee you to death where you

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.400 
trying to melee you to death where you
can<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.599> throw<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> vortex

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
can just like throw them in the vortex

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.160 
can just like throw them in the vortex
and<00:00:28.590> whatever<00:00:28.859> these<00:00:29.789> guys<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.720> some<00:00:30.990> pretty

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and whatever these guys have some pretty

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.659 
and whatever these guys have some pretty
cool<00:00:31.380> mechanics<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.099> wanted<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> show<00:00:32.640> you

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
cool mechanics that I wanted to show you

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.670 
cool mechanics that I wanted to show you
and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.210> also<00:00:33.329> took<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.780> liberty<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> scanning

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and I also took the liberty of scanning

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
and I also took the liberty of scanning
all<00:00:34.950> them<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> fullest<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.420> kind

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
all them to the fullest so you can kind

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.750 
all them to the fullest so you can kind
of<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.620> drop<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.370> first<00:00:38.579> enemy

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of see what they drop the first enemy

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.920 
of see what they drop the first enemy
though<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.390> talking<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
though I'm gonna be talking about is the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.650 
though I'm gonna be talking about is the
swarm<00:00:40.530> medalists<00:00:41.280> mole<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> mutation

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
swarm medalists mole which is a mutation

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.139 
swarm medalists mole which is a mutation
of<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> fusion<00:00:43.410> MOA<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.370> guy<00:00:44.910> will

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of a fusion MOA and this guy will

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
of a fusion MOA and this guy will
basically<00:00:45.420> fire<00:00:46.289> these<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.890> spore

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
basically fire these little spore

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.270 
basically fire these little spore
missiles<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> will<00:00:48.210> discharge<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.680> contact

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
missiles that will discharge on contact

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
missiles that will discharge on contact
and<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.520> engulf<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.660> swarms<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.410> what

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and just engulf you with swarms of what

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
and just engulf you with swarms of what
looked<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.920> locusts<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.329> not

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
looked like locusts and if you're not

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
looked like locusts and if you're not
careful<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.379> totally<00:00:55.620> consume

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
careful they can just totally consume

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.760 
careful they can just totally consume
you<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.850> slowly<00:00:57.360> drain<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.170> shields

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you and just slowly drain your shields

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
you and just slowly drain your shields
and<00:00:58.920> health<00:00:59.460> until<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.239> absolutely<00:01:00.570> dead

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and health until you're absolutely dead

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
and health until you're absolutely dead
so<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> best<00:01:00.989> thing<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.320> them<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.859> just

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so the best thing with them is you just

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.700 
so the best thing with them is you just
keep<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.370> distance<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.470> up

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
keep your distance because if you get up

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
keep your distance because if you get up
close<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.489> also<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
close to them they can also do the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
close to them they can also do the
stomping<00:01:06.689> effect<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> stomping<00:01:08.280> mole

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
stomping effect that the stomping mole

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280 
stomping effect that the stomping mole
can<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.000> well<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.170> good

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
can do as well so they have pretty good

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
can do as well so they have pretty good
defensive<00:01:10.890> mechanism<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
defensive mechanism and they like to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
defensive mechanism and they like to
fight<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> from<00:01:13.170> afar<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.670> best<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
fight you from afar but it's best to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
fight you from afar but it's best to
just<00:01:15.090> run<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.140> engulfed

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
just run for them if you get engulfed

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
just run for them if you get engulfed
from<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> locusts<00:01:17.189> honestly<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.820> too

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
from the locusts honestly because too

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
from the locusts honestly because too
much<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> definitely<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.590> problematic

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
much of it can definitely be problematic

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
much of it can definitely be problematic
the<00:01:20.549> next<00:01:20.820> enemy<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> tar<00:01:21.630> medalist<00:01:22.140> MOA<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the next enemy is a tar medalist MOA and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
the next enemy is a tar medalist MOA and
this<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> another<00:01:23.490> mutation<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> Fusion

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this one is another mutation of a Fusion

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.990 
this one is another mutation of a Fusion
MOA<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.619> will<00:01:25.799> fire<00:01:26.100> these<00:01:26.400> well

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
MOA but this one will fire these well

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.870 
MOA but this one will fire these well
like<00:01:27.119> description<00:01:27.570> says<00:01:27.720> tar<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.290> mucus

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
like description says tar like mucus

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.730 
like description says tar like mucus
sludge<00:01:29.880> type<00:01:30.479> things<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.229> slow<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
sludge type things that will slow you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
sludge type things that will slow you
down<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.610> step<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.450> also<00:01:34.079> do

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
down if you step in it and also do

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.679 
down if you step in it and also do
damage<00:01:34.619> over<00:01:34.890> time<00:01:34.920> effect<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.210> guy<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
damage over time effect so this guy in

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.630 
damage over time effect so this guy in
combination<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> swarm<00:01:37.829> needless<00:01:38.369> MOA

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
combination with a swarm needless MOA

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
combination with a swarm needless MOA
can<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.180> absolutely<00:01:39.600> devastating<00:01:40.500> because

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
can be absolutely devastating because

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
can be absolutely devastating because
it'll<00:01:41.009> make<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.909> already<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.360> almost

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it'll make it so you already you almost

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
it'll make it so you already you almost
unable<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.530> move<00:01:43.770> well<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.520> sludge<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> if

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
unable to move well in the sludge and if

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
unable to move well in the sludge and if
other<00:01:46.140> infested<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.009> surround<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> during

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
other infested can surround you during

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
other infested can surround you during
this<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.420> big<00:01:48.600> trouble<00:01:48.630> next<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.530> have

the boiler who is a huge pus bowl of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.960 
the boiler who is a huge pus bowl of
spores<00:01:52.079> when<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.770> actually<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.399> damage<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
him he'll drop these spawning pause that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.670 
him he'll drop these spawning pause that
will<00:01:55.920> spawn<00:01:56.280> more<00:01:56.610> infested<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.619> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
they'll just start spawning a bunch of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.350

that will drop that High Noon stance so
definitely<00:02:24.300> take<00:02:24.450> knew<00:02:24.600> too<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.110> is

definitely take knew too that this is

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
definitely take knew too that this is
gonna<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.680> one<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.220> want<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.490> be<00:02:26.580> hunting

gonna be the one you want to be hunting

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.180 
gonna be the one you want to be hunting
if<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.840> are<00:02:28.050> looking<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.590> stance<00:02:28.860> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
if you are looking for that stance and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.530 
if you are looking for that stance and
the<00:02:29.310> last<00:02:29.490> thing<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.730> want<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> point<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.270> too

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the last thing I want to point out too

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.270 
the last thing I want to point out too
is<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:31.050> these<00:02:31.200> new<00:02:31.440> enemies<00:02:31.890> seem<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.190> be

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
is that all these new enemies seem to be

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.910 
is that all these new enemies seem to be
most<00:02:32.520> susceptible<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.300> corrosive<00:02:34.230> damage<00:02:34.260> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
most susceptible to corrosive damage and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.400 
most susceptible to corrosive damage and
then<00:02:35.190> blast<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.820> slash<00:02:36.240> not<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.990> fire<00:02:37.230> on

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
then blast and slash not just fire on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.990 
then blast and slash not just fire on
its<00:02:37.530> own<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:37.860> gives<00:02:38.100> us<00:02:38.280> even<00:02:38.580> more<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.910> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
its own so this gives us even more of a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.090 
its own so this gives us even more of a
reason<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:40.020> build<00:02:40.350> mostly<00:02:40.890> into

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
reason to just build mostly into

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100 
reason to just build mostly into
corrosive<00:02:41.550> or<00:02:41.760> adding<00:02:42.240> blasts<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.870> want

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
corrosive or adding blasts if you want

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.410 
corrosive or adding blasts if you want
for<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.770> extra<00:02:44.160> CC<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.000> knockdown

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
for that extra CC to get that knockdown

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.750 
for that extra CC to get that knockdown
effect<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.560> mean<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.160> was<00:02:47.280> already<00:02:47.400> kind<00:02:47.640> of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
effect so I mean I was already kind of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.310 
effect so I mean I was already kind of
doing<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.360> buff<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> ancients
