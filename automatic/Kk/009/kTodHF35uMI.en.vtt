00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.930 
instance we've powered layout down and
we've<00:02:09.560> changed<00:02:09.860> all<00:02:10.070> our<00:02:10.190> engines<00:02:10.369> around<00:02:10.790> and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
we've changed all our engines around and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.449 
we've changed all our engines around and
we<00:02:11.090> want<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.500> now<00:02:12.500> control<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> whole<00:02:13.160> different

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
we want to now control a whole different

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.130 
we want to now control a whole different
set<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.640> engines<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.180> we<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.750> bring<00:02:14.989> them

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
set of engines and we want to bring them

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.030 
set of engines and we want to bring them
all<00:02:15.320> up<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> current<00:02:16.820> active<00:02:17.209> set<00:02:17.959> we<00:02:18.860> can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
all up to the current active set we can

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.470 
all up to the current active set we can
easily<00:02:19.489> do<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.670> by<00:02:19.850> hitting<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.239> read

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
easily do that by hitting the read

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.060 
easily do that by hitting the read
button<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.989> when<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.530> press<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.920> read

button and when you press the read

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.970 
button and when you press the read
button<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:23.180> remote<00:02:23.590> sends<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> command<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
button the remote sends a command to the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.550 
button the remote sends a command to the
ti<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.850> check<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.959> engines<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.410> are

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
ti you to check all the engines that are

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.830 
ti you to check all the engines that are
on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.769> track<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.120> what<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.360> does<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.720> now

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
on the track so what it does is it now

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.479 
on the track so what it does is it now
basically<00:02:30.140> when<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.650> go<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.920> engine<00:02:31.250> list

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
basically when you go to the engine list

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.120 
basically when you go to the engine list
it<00:02:32.239> now<00:02:32.540> lists<00:02:32.840> all<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.410> engines<00:02:33.769> that<00:02:33.860> are<00:02:33.920> on

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
it now lists all the engines that are on

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.060 
it now lists all the engines that are on
the<00:02:34.250> layout<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.870> now<00:02:36.019> easily<00:02:36.560> select

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
the layout and you can now easily select

can't cut the input power because the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.740 
can't cut the input power because the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
connected to the track for that reason

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.830 
connected to the track for that reason
well<00:04:32.099> that<00:04:32.550> reason<00:04:32.909> in<00:04:33.000> others<00:04:33.270> what<00:04:33.780> I

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
well that reason in others what I

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.290 
well that reason in others what I
actually<00:04:34.110> choose<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.860> use<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.789> wireless

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
actually choose to use is a wireless

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.969 
actually choose to use is a wireless
outlet<00:04:39.630> remote<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.930> what<00:04:41.500> basically<00:04:41.620> what

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
outlet remote and what basically what

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.650 
outlet remote and what basically what
this<00:04:42.220> remote<00:04:42.669> allows<00:04:42.970> me<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.240> do<00:04:43.360> if<00:04:43.539> this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
this remote allows me to do if this

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.249 
this remote allows me to do if this
thing<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.080> focus<00:04:44.410> here<00:04:44.590> there<00:04:45.220> we<00:04:45.310> go<00:04:46.259> it

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
thing the focus here there we go it

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.020 
thing the focus here there we go it
basically<00:04:47.590> allows<00:04:47.740> me<00:04:48.039> to<00:04:48.130> cut<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.490> cut<00:04:48.910> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
basically allows me to cut the cut the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.510 
basically allows me to cut the cut the
power<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.449> my<00:04:49.569> wall<00:04:49.810> outlet<00:04:50.229> on<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.099> off<00:04:51.220> with

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.420 
of another one that we've also tried
that<00:05:16.900> works<00:05:17.110> good<00:05:19.500> okay<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.770> think<00:05:21.099> that<00:05:21.250> pretty

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
that works good okay I think that pretty
