you<00:00:30.539> want<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> set<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.380> your<00:00:31.529> major

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
you want to set all of your major

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.319 
you want to set all of your major
subdivisions<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> 1<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
subdivisions to 1 and then you want to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
subdivisions to 1 and then you want to
make<00:00:36.480> sure<00:00:36.629> that<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.930> subdivisions<00:00:37.500> percent

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.700 
make sure that your subdivisions percent
division<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.789> set<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.969> 1<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.539> so<00:00:40.469> come

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
division is also set to 1 and so come

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.090 
division is also set to 1 and so come
down<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:41.160> halfway<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.449> repeat<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
down about halfway and repeat that for

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.029 
down about halfway and repeat that for
your<00:00:44.390> y-axis<00:00:46.640> that's<00:00:47.640> all

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.810 

now<00:00:50.609> the<00:00:51.329> major<00:00:51.510> X<00:00:51.839> divisions<00:00:52.350> right<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
now the major X divisions right here is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.389 
now the major X divisions right here is
your<00:00:54.539> stitch<00:00:54.719> count<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> mine's<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.149> 20

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
your stitch count so mine's gonna be 20

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.649 
your stitch count so mine's gonna be 20
then<00:00:59.399> come<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.239> major<00:01:00.390> y

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
then come down and your major y

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.440 
then come down and your major y
divisions<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.409> row<00:01:01.859> count<00:01:03.110> 30<00:01:05.390> now<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
divisions is your row count 30 now to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
divisions is your row count 30 now to
set<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.170> actual<00:01:07.979> grid<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.940> will<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.330> doing

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
set my actual grid what I will be doing

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
set my actual grid what I will be doing
is<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> adjust<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.340> spacing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is I'm going to adjust this spacing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.160 
is I'm going to adjust this spacing
right<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.009> I<00:01:14.039> will<00:01:14.190> have<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
right here so that I will have a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.420 
right here so that I will have a
rectangular<00:01:16.170> grid<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.740> opposed<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
rectangular grid as opposed to the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.420 
rectangular grid as opposed to the
square<00:01:17.700> grid<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.420> by<00:01:18.539> default

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
square grid that you will get by default

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.210 
square grid that you will get by default
and<00:01:20.659> this<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.679> I<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:22.890> set

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and this what I will do is I will set

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.160 
and this what I will do is I will set
this<00:01:23.429> to<00:01:23.670> 18<00:01:24.060> pixels<00:01:24.890> per<00:01:25.890> side<00:01:26.130> division

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
this to 18 pixels per side division

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
this to 18 pixels per side division
actually<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.350> per<00:01:28.679> major<00:01:28.890> division<00:01:29.369> really

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
actually will per major division really

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.559 
actually will per major division really
for<00:01:29.789> this<00:01:31.250> then<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> come<00:01:32.940> down<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
for this then I'm going to come down and

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:40.390 
for this then I'm going to come down and
I'm<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:35.009> set<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.610> Y<00:01:36.590> 12

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.900 

now<00:01:40.970> I'm<00:01:41.150> going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.510> adjust<00:01:41.750> my<00:01:42.490> thickness<00:01:43.490> my

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
now I'm going to adjust my thickness my

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.899 
now I'm going to adjust my thickness my
lines<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.480> want<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.900> set<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> one

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.250 

and<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.150> gonna<00:01:48.270> set<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.570> officer<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.020> one

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
and I'm gonna set this officer to one

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.460 
and I'm gonna set this officer to one
pixel<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.979> he<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.460> these<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.060> equal

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
pixel because he want these to be equal

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.140 
pixel because he want these to be equal
to<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.590> one

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
to this one

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.010 
to this one
or<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:55.820> vertical<00:01:56.820> lines<00:01:57.030> will<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.300> thicker

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
or your vertical lines will be thicker

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340 
or your vertical lines will be thicker
or<00:01:58.590> skinnier<00:01:59.130> than<00:01:59.820> your<00:01:59.940> horizontal<00:02:00.210> lines

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
or skinnier than your horizontal lines

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.200 
or skinnier than your horizontal lines
and<00:02:02.860> then<00:02:02.950> I'm<00:02:03.070> going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.340> adjust<00:02:03.490> my<00:02:03.790> border

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
and then I'm going to adjust my border

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.060 
and then I'm going to adjust my border
because<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.600> like<00:02:04.870> that<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.229> be<00:02:05.350> thicker<00:02:05.920> than

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
because I like that to be thicker than

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.930 
because I like that to be thicker than
my<00:02:07.000> major<00:02:07.240> divisions<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:09.220> quite<00:02:09.670> as

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
my major divisions but not quite as

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.550 
my major divisions but not quite as
thick<00:02:10.210> as<00:02:10.330> three<00:02:10.539> pixels<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.170> like<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.440> go

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
thick as three pixels so I like to go

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.320 
thick as three pixels so I like to go
about<00:02:11.740> two<00:02:12.070> for<00:02:12.310> that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
about two for that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.600 
about two for that
for<00:02:13.870> these<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> find<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.740> anything<00:02:15.190> over<00:02:15.430> one

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
for these I find that anything over one

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.960 
for these I find that anything over one
and<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.790> half<00:02:16.000> pixels<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.750> too<00:02:17.050> too<00:02:17.530> thick<00:02:17.970> but

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and a half pixels is too too thick but
