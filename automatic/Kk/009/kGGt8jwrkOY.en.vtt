00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.699 
attacks and as you notice with this the
great<00:02:20.600> thing<00:02:20.630> about<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:21.110> instead<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.470> having

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
great thing about it instead of having

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.570 
great thing about it instead of having
one<00:02:22.459> output<00:02:23.150> there<00:02:23.750> are<00:02:23.870> three<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:25.280> smart

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
one output there are three and the smart

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.280 
one output there are three and the smart
thing<00:02:25.730> about<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.150> particular<00:02:26.480> blaster<00:02:27.170> is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
thing about this particular blaster is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.590 
thing about this particular blaster is
that<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.950> identify<00:02:28.100> which<00:02:28.970> are<00:02:29.239> loaded

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
that it can identify which are loaded

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.240 
that it can identify which are loaded
and<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.200> doesn't<00:02:30.500> blasts<00:02:30.650> all<00:02:30.860> three<00:02:31.100> at<00:02:31.220> once

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
and it doesn't blasts all three at once

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.970 
and it doesn't blasts all three at once
so<00:02:32.239> you've<00:02:32.480> got<00:02:32.630> three<00:02:32.900> chances<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.380> blast

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
so you've got three chances to blast

so you've got three chances to blast
your<00:02:34.280> targets<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:35.390> works<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> clockwise<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
your targets it works in a clockwise the

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.229 
your targets it works in a clockwise the
thing<00:02:36.980> about<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.310> blaster<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.760> got<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.120> make

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
thing about this blaster you got to make

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.030 
thing about this blaster you got to make
sure<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.540> you're<00:02:38.690> more<00:02:38.810> precise<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:40.010> your

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.190 
aim because each of the barrels are
located<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.070> different<00:02:43.100> places<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.510> precision

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
located in different places so precision

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.470
