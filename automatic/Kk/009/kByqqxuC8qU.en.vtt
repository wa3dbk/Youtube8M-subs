inside<00:04:36.919> Russia<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.520> outside<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.419> was

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
inside Russia in outside and that was

inside Russia in outside and that was
the<00:04:38.930> plan<00:04:39.310> now<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.550> seems<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.210> plan<00:04:41.480> is

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
the plan now it seems that the plan is

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.500 
the plan now it seems that the plan is
changing<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.650> Putin<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.639> likely<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.150> come

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
changing and Putin is likely to come

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.650
