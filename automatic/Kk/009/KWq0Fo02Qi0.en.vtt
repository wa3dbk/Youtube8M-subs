00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.759
 this 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.229
 is 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.749
 good to prepare them on names they have also prepared 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.109
 mashed beans 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.839
 cut lettuce 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.359
 the bullet and disinfected 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.739
 sansal your preference 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.119
 they want more 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.220
 which in the seventh time 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.890
 who suffers underlined 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.399
 and security 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.399
 Well, this time I'm going to use the press 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 and surely will use are not the press ma girl although it seems a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.910
 plastic bag 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.970
 and what we are going to do is open the sides 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.820
 iss leave the background uncut 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.830
 this is going to facilitate this to prepare the tortilla 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.060
 so let's win 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.640
 a piece of massa 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.100
 let's go to Mazatlan 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 that we do not have to round 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.060
 let's put it in the middle of the bag or we will apply with the press 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 we turn and re-open the other side 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 It is important that we have the hot comal because otherwise it will 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 we will stick the dough 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.259
 so once we have that we are going to carefully remove the plastic 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 and we're going to put it in the comal 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.130
 well then when we put it in the comal 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.620
 we are going to realize that they are ready when they start urinating the salcedo 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.670
 as here d3m sanzar is ready to flip 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.010
 then we flip 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.090
 and let's let them deum you 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.620
 a moment nothing more 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.300
 do not worry if it's not stitched because I'm going to pass the oil but 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.380
 regularly caps 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.600
 they were the transener of the comahue 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 You will see how a decent person submitted his resignation 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.100
 we remove the tortilla 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 some people bend the shore 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.210
 that's why in some December states ten faces 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 so who 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.350
 of recommendations that the expedition be hot 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.429
 Feliciano Monreal Ávila 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.359
 and we will keep 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.359
 Well, they already had all the daily preserves 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.919
 I'm going to pass them through oil 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.099
 this is to make them a little more resistant 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.969
 so this is how he searched can leave the blessed souls toast as 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.579
 you 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.579
 so let's put it on one side and then hit them on the other 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.509
 and now let's prepare 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.509
 Well, let's start laying eggs, ground beans 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.829
 some people immediately put the sauce on me, others do not want to import the 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.189
 palin order to put it 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.879
 fly by adding which 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.579
 they can add polino like the shit and meat of birds 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.059
 in the us we have news 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.059
 so I opted to put cooked sticks 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 added a little onion 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.369
 lettuce remember that all this is not a taste 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.629
 this is an option 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.239
 and regularly I do not know are the men with beans boost that that's not 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.359
 it did good I do not know how to say but varying from house to house 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.969
 well time to use the sauce your preference in this case I will use 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.499
 The green 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.919
 they can put creams 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.029
 and to decorate and finish fresh cheese 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.269
 so I hope you liked it 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.049
 there in the scene shows a true red 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.599
 the hikes 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.189
 they are already to the channel 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.179
 so she 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.209
 It was at that moment that you 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.659
 itaugua the scam to a request I do not remember a person who asked me 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.019
 but to say that I will not go to the club mesalina ballades abertis and those who 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.019
 well who were flooded in the next biennium 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:02.739
