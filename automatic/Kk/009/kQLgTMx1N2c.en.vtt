 moment I do not want to know anything legal and in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.880
 the next day 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.460
 the point is that it's one thing that came out 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.320
 because I was safer 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.760
 Hello 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.079

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.079
 there are people who see it every day 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.720
 is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.040

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.510

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.320
 control but I'm a little line 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.320
 purple ninja 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.960
 it's a little 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.300
 It has been very complicated 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 Paris 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.370
 I'm looking for the combination of in that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.640
 he threw it against the hedges and he caught 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.640
 single 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.590
 hot 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.810

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.829
 Robert 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.829
 I was confident 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.990
 or not 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 and 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.370
 and opening a little in the air I like 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.370
 let there be a waste of you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.960

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.070

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.330

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.290
 but no no 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.769
 it's a bit similar in the zones 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.769
 caught up 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.740

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.030

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.510
 the music is invisible 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.590
