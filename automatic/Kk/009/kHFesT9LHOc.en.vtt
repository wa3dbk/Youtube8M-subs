00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
except except except maybe maybe and may

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.120 
except except except maybe maybe and may
be<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.280> sentence<00:02:32.760> maybe<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:34.530> should<00:02:34.920> eat

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
be so in a sentence maybe we should eat

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.520 
be so in a sentence maybe we should eat
pizza<00:02:36.680> maybe<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:38.190> should<00:02:38.430> eat<00:02:38.520> pizza<00:02:39.530> that's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
pizza maybe we should eat pizza that's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.100 
pizza maybe we should eat pizza that's
like<00:02:40.770> okay<00:02:41.130> yes<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:42.000> no<00:02:42.270> should<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:42.930> eat<00:02:43.260> pizza

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
like okay yes or no should we eat pizza

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.330 
like okay yes or no should we eat pizza
maybe<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:48.440> pizza<00:02:49.440> may<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.150> best<00:02:51.330> idea

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
maybe is pizza may be the best idea

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
maybe is pizza may be the best idea
pizza<00:02:53.340> may<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.570> best<00:02:54.810> idea<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.660> may

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
pizza may be the best idea so this may

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.400 
pizza may be the best idea so this may
be<00:02:58.110> first<00:02:58.800> one<00:02:59.600> maybe<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:01.140> should<00:03:01.410> eat<00:03:01.560> pizza

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
be first one maybe we should eat pizza

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.250 
be first one maybe we should eat pizza
that<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.709> used<00:03:05.250> differently<00:03:05.489> than<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.450> may

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that is used differently than this may

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.449 
that is used differently than this may
be<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.640> use<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.090> maybe<00:03:09.920> for<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.100> you've<00:03:11.250> got

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
be you use the maybe for if you've got

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.009 
be you use the maybe for if you've got
like<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.360> noun<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:13.080> front<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:15.019> wouldn't

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
like a noun in front of it you wouldn't

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.050 
like a noun in front of it you wouldn't
say<00:03:16.200> pizza<00:03:16.530> maybe<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:17.250> should<00:03:17.459> eat<00:03:17.519> Pete<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
say pizza maybe we should eat Pete you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.880 
say pizza maybe we should eat Pete you
know<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.660> wouldn't<00:03:18.930> put<00:03:19.200> pizza<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.769> then

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
know you wouldn't put pizza and then

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.229 
know you wouldn't put pizza and then
this<00:03:20.040> one<00:03:20.330> pizza<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:21.840> may<00:03:22.290> be<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:24.000> best

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this one pizza and then may be the best

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.470 
this one pizza and then may be the best
idea<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.799> computer<00:03:26.570> maybe<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:29.480> fastest

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
idea the computer maybe the fastest

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.180 
idea the computer maybe the fastest
method<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.320> talking<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:33.330> could<00:03:33.750> say<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.860> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
method of talking you could say on the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.819 
method of talking you could say on the
first<00:03:35.370> one<00:03:35.640> maybe<00:03:36.570> we<00:03:37.019> should<00:03:37.350> use<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
first one maybe we should use the

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.630 
first one maybe we should use the
computer<00:03:38.360> maybe<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:40.049> computer<00:03:40.320> is<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.280> best

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
computer maybe the computer is the best

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.870 
computer maybe the computer is the best
for<00:03:42.329> example
