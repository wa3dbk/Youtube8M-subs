00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.110
 it's a game of lady gambit the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.110
 white starts from 4 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.360
 of 564 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.120

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.120
 horse makes 3 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.420
 caballé 16 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.219
 typical of the side in the ladies capital 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 film 5 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.750
 we already have the good horse 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.750
 logical bishops 7 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.950
 horse instead of 7 defend their other 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.549
 caballito has also given bishop defense 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.549
 and horse 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.680
 I do not know if in good play 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.530
 I do not see it badly 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 caballé c3 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.330
 Of 6 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.430
 also the concept 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 by francisco 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.440
 strong 5 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.440
 at the end of 5 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.230
 bishop of the 7 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.420
 and the little horse jumps 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.420
 every 5 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.490
 now here the horse is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.270
 is threatened by the white horse by 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.270
 the white reptile 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.120
 but it seems that wings 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.220
 and horses lack of 4 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.060
 I'm rolling 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.140
 the short block 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.140
 in what short 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.260
 Bishop Ts 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.240
 anyway 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.420
 With which 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.290
 they eat it 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.780
 x 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.019
 gentleman c6 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.019
 yes yes 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.830
 but almost all lateral that is placed in 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.830
 the in him 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.680
 horse for the next 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.760
 horse wake the auction of a black king 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.760
 give the face 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.310
 given by 7 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.620
 and taking advantage of this horse is 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.700
 nailed 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.190
 because at last so white 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.760
 in this transit and threat 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.760
 at the age of 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.450
 the bed moves to 4 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.199
 horse by efe 6 check cell 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.500
 They were pizzbur and gives the king a check 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.500
 black 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.490
 the player piri was great he was very 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.100
 good very good tactician now he is 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.790
 giving check 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.790
 black king 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.850
 is hugging the lama 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.000
 you can shelter it you can can 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.660
 to stamp 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.660
 the worst 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.690
 but missouri 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.310
 he is a great player although he knows that 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.590
 wants the best player in history 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.030
 he does not know 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.490
 yes look what I'm going to say now 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.280
 same the best player in history 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.260
 it was moses 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.030
 It was Moses because he was the only player 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.030
 that God granted him to take 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.270
 a game 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.270
 ago by efe 6 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.759
 Black takes on the horse with the pawn 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.140
 I think it would have been better for him 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.140
 horse but good I take with the pawn 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.189
 and the bishop 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.440
 it is placed in h 6 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.440
 and threatens this tower 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.510
 but good to black that does not 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.630
 it matters because they say I stay and I 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.730
 threatened this tower 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.030
 he also lets them change it with the 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.030
 Lady 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.670
 but tisbury is not 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.670
 and to change the tower that 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:16.430
 and what he does is a play 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:18.500
 as lady f3 here now has no defense 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.840
 but 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.190
 practically if you already have defense because 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.700
 we are going to see it now well 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.700
 queen f3 given by efe 3 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.540
 Y 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.580
 Torres 1 check this columnita the lady 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.289
 would be able to pawn and this will 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.569
 it's open 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:48.129
 and the catastrophe is coming 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.129
 in the catastrophe for black 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.669
 h 8 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.650
 the g7 check 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:08.979
 religion 8 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:11.490
 filippo 16 check with the unique tower 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.490
 move 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.980
 move the lady lady 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.630
 of 4 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.230
 and white 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:24.630
 great bill buhr and ends with double because 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.570
 4 checkmate 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:31.370

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.370
 time this mini game has liked 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.310

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.240
