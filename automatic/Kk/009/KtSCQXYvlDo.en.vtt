00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
going into early Sunday so it'll be like
a<00:01:36.810> 10<00:01:37.079> a.m.<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.439> ten<00:01:37.590> am<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
a 10 a.m. to ten am kind of thing that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.039 
a 10 a.m. to ten am kind of thing that
would<00:01:38.970> make<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.299> most<00:01:39.329> sense<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> way

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
would make the most sense to me that way

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
would make the most sense to me that way
I<00:01:40.079> wake<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.950> ready<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.490> start

I wake up get ready and just start

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
I wake up get ready and just start
streaming<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
streaming as so then I don't have to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.569 
streaming as so then I don't have to
stay<00:01:43.470> awake<00:01:43.680> any<00:01:43.890> longer<00:01:43.979> than<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.460> otherwise

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
stay awake any longer than I otherwise

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
stay awake any longer than I otherwise
would<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.299> because<00:01:46.020> otherwise<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.470> if

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
would have to because otherwise like if

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
would have to because otherwise like if
I<00:01:46.680> started<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.159> five<00:01:47.579> at<00:01:47.820> night<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I started like five at night then it's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
I started like five at night then it's
gonna<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.689> even<00:01:48.930> mess<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:49.500> sleep<00:01:49.560> schedule

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
even more so I'm thinking that's gonna

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.630 
even more so I'm thinking that's gonna
make<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> most<00:01:53.040> sense<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.340> I'll<00:01:53.430> keep<00:01:53.520> you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
take it into consideration so this is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.789 
take it into consideration so this is
our<00:04:15.570> channel<00:04:15.870> guys<00:04:16.019> without<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.709> guys

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
watching then there's you know it's like

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.060 
watching then there's you know it's like
if<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.720> tree<00:04:18.870> falls<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.200> forest<00:04:19.560> no<00:04:19.919> ones

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
if a tree falls in the forest no ones

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.020 
if a tree falls in the forest no ones
that<00:04:20.160> are<00:04:20.250> here<00:04:20.400> doesn't<00:04:20.669> make<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.849> sound

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
that are here doesn't make it sound

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.400 
that are here doesn't make it sound
probably<00:04:21.299> not<00:04:21.510> do<00:04:21.660> my<00:04:21.750> videos<00:04:22.049> make<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.229> sound

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.080 
probably not do my videos make a sound
if<00:04:22.530> no<00:04:22.710> one<00:04:22.800> watches<00:04:23.070> them<00:04:23.190> probably<00:04:23.490> not

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
if no one watches them probably not

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.120 
if no one watches them probably not
