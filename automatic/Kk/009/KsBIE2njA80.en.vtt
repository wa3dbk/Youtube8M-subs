with<00:02:07.700> him<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.000> could<00:02:08.300> work<00:02:08.480> alongside<00:02:08.960> him

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
with him so I could work alongside him

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.200 
with him so I could work alongside him
and<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:09.920> time<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.520> was<00:02:11.030> still<00:02:11.150> a

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
and at that time I was still a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.600 
and at that time I was still a
programmer<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:12.560> he<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.070> were<00:02:13.220> just<00:02:13.430> like

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
programmer so he and I were just like

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.610 
programmer so he and I were just like
jamming<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.720> would<00:02:14.960> code<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.500> he

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
jamming and out I would code and he

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.590 
jamming and out I would code and he
would<00:02:15.770> draw<00:02:16.160> an<00:02:16.430> out<00:02:16.580> code<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.180> he<00:02:17.270> was<00:02:17.420> draw

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
would draw an out code and he was draw

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.810 
would draw an out code and he was draw
who<00:02:17.960> would<00:02:18.080> sit<00:02:18.320> at<00:02:18.770> night<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.460> come<00:02:19.610> up<00:02:19.700> with

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
who would sit at night and come up with

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.100 
who would sit at night and come up with
these<00:02:19.910> game<00:02:20.150> ideas<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.720> we<00:02:21.080> actually

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
these game ideas so we we actually

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.410 
these game ideas so we we actually
landed<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.740> game<00:02:21.920> called<00:02:22.190> sugar<00:02:22.790> rush<00:02:23.030> which

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
landed a game called sugar rush which

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.800 
landed a game called sugar rush which
was<00:02:23.660> kind<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.370> arena<00:02:25.370> battle<00:02:26.150> fighting<00:02:26.630> game

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
was kind of a arena battle fighting game

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.150 
was kind of a arena battle fighting game
where<00:02:27.140> he<00:02:27.200> could<00:02:27.320> customize<00:02:27.650> your<00:02:27.770> characters

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
where he could customize your characters

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.490 
where he could customize your characters
it<00:02:28.430> had<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.240> RPG<00:02:29.690> elements<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.230> stuff<00:02:30.380> like

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it had like RPG elements and stuff like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.900 
it had like RPG elements and stuff like
that<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:30.860> kind<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.220> Awesomenauts

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
that it's kind of like Awesomenauts

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.970 
that it's kind of like Awesomenauts
so<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:32.959> pitched<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> company<00:02:33.740> called

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
so we pitched that to a company called

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.520 
so we pitched that to a company called
Nexon<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.360> actually<00:02:35.900> got<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.050> deal<00:02:36.320> it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
Nexon and we actually got that deal it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.660 
Nexon and we actually got that deal it
was<00:02:36.590> kind<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:36.980> here's<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:37.430> opportunity

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
was kind of like here's an opportunity

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.760 
was kind of like here's an opportunity
here's<00:02:38.420> something<00:02:38.660> really<00:02:38.900> fun<00:02:39.140> let's<00:02:39.560> try

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
here's something really fun let's try

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.010 
here's something really fun let's try
something<00:02:39.980> different<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.670> he<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.480> really

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
really close to making this game come

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.110 
really close to making this game come
out<00:02:56.989> like<00:02:57.410> really<00:02:58.100> close<00:02:58.520> there<00:02:58.790> are<00:02:58.880> two

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
out like really close there are two

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.110 
out like really close there are two
weeks<00:02:59.420> away<00:02:59.660> from<00:02:59.810> going<00:03:00.170> into<00:03:00.410> open<00:03:00.739> beta

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
weeks away from going into open beta

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.550 
weeks away from going into open beta
where<00:03:02.120> basically<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> world<00:03:03.050> can<00:03:03.260> play<00:03:03.440> it

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
where basically the world can play it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.320 
where basically the world can play it
and<00:03:06.280> next<00:03:07.280> on<00:03:07.400> North<00:03:07.610> America<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.000> close

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
when they went down they went down

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.710 
when they went down they went down
literally<00:03:11.640> around<00:03:11.850> us<00:03:12.090> people<00:03:12.300> were<00:03:12.570> like

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
literally around us people were like

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.390 
literally around us people were like
packing<00:03:13.050> their<00:03:13.170> stuff<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.620> around<00:03:13.890> us<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.130> we

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.800 
finish all of that in like the two
months<00:03:54.410> who<00:03:55.410> was<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.710> worst<00:03:55.950> time<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:56.370> life

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
months who was the worst time of my life

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.840 
months who was the worst time of my life
that<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.020> worst<00:03:58.410> time<00:03:58.620> with<00:03:59.430> shank<00:03:59.670> we

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
that was the worst time with shank we

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.280 
that was the worst time with shank we
were<00:03:59.940> kind<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.210> running<00:04:00.300> around<00:04:00.510> we're<00:04:01.110> trying

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
were kind of running around we're trying

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.390 
were kind of running around we're trying
a<00:04:01.350> whole<00:04:01.440> bunch<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.680> different<00:04:01.950> things<00:04:01.980> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
a whole bunch of different things and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.970 
a whole bunch of different things and
and<00:04:02.640> it's<00:04:03.630> time-consuming<00:04:03.960> to<00:04:04.470> experiment

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
and it's time-consuming to experiment

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.550 
and it's time-consuming to experiment
that<00:04:05.160> way<00:04:05.310> for<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.820> first<00:04:06.030> time<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.840> felt<00:04:07.440> like

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
that way for the first time I felt like

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.960 
that way for the first time I felt like
I'm<00:04:07.680> actually<00:04:07.890> not<00:04:08.190> going<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.460> be<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.700> do<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
I'm actually not going to be to do the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.930 
I'm actually not going to be to do the
thing<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.210> I<00:04:09.360> promised<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.810> was<00:04:09.930> going<00:04:09.960> to<00:04:10.140> do

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
thing that I promised I was going to do

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.820 
thing that I promised I was going to do
pretty<00:04:11.940> much<00:04:12.150> right<00:04:12.390> around<00:04:12.600> shank<00:04:12.960> ended<00:04:13.560> I

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
pretty much right around shank ended I

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.490 
pretty much right around shank ended I
was<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.550> well<00:04:14.820> if<00:04:15.330> we're<00:04:15.630> going<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.989> build<00:04:16.350> a
