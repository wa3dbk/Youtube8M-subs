would not surprise me if we see a lot

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
would not surprise me if we see a lot
more<00:01:02.820> signings<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.719> Manchester<00:01:04.199> United<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
more signings from Manchester United and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
more signings from Manchester United and
I'm<00:01:04.890> sure<00:01:05.070> vine<00:01:05.280> girl<00:01:05.460> knows<00:01:05.670> exactly<00:01:06.000> what

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
I'm sure vine girl knows exactly what

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.940 
I'm sure vine girl knows exactly what
he's<00:01:06.420> doing<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.229> has<00:01:07.409> been<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> his

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
he's doing but this has been one of his

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.609 
he's doing but this has been one of his
big<00:01:08.220> target<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:10.049> he<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.439> an

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
big target and I think he would be an

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.230 
big target and I think he would be an
amazing<00:01:10.950> signing<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.760> Manchester<00:01:12.210> United

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
amazing signing for Manchester United

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.780 
amazing signing for Manchester United
United<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:13.500> necessarily<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.430> great

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
United don't necessarily have a great

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.820 
United don't necessarily have a great
defense<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> moment<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:16.380> did<00:01:16.590> make<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
defense at the moment they did make a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
defense at the moment they did make a
really<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.700> signing<00:01:18.240> actually<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> Luke

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
really good signing actually of Luke

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
really good signing actually of Luke
Shaw<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.500> 430<00:01:19.860> million<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> think

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
Shaw that was 430 million but I think

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.460 
Shaw that was 430 million but I think
homos<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> fantastic<00:01:21.600> signing<00:01:22.350> as

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
homos would be a fantastic signing as

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
homos would be a fantastic signing as
well<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.729> wouldn't<00:01:24.000> surprise<00:01:24.119> me<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.630> he

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
well and it wouldn't surprise me if he

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.240 
well and it wouldn't surprise me if he
went<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> same<00:01:25.470> time<00:01:25.680> it'd<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> bit

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
went but at the same time it'd be a bit

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
went but at the same time it'd be a bit
strange<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.240> used<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.630> seeing

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
and this could be their first signing

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.990 
and this could be their first signing
since<00:03:51.670> Luis<00:03:52.000> Suarez<00:03:52.420> got<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.650> got<00:03:54.310> sold<00:03:54.610> so

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
since Luis Suarez got the got sold so

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.080 
since Luis Suarez got the got sold so
yeah<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:56.020> Remy<00:03:56.410> will<00:03:56.860> be<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.250> really<00:03:57.940> good

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
yeah like Remy will be a really good

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.760 
yeah like Remy will be a really good
player<00:03:58.330> actually<00:03:58.600> for<00:03:58.990> Liverpool<00:03:59.380> if<00:03:59.620> they

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
player actually for Liverpool if they

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.070 
player actually for Liverpool if they
sign<00:04:00.010> him<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.370> definitely<00:04:01.240> need<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.840> I

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
sign him and definitely need it and I

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.840 
sign him and definitely need it and I
still<00:04:02.350> think<00:04:02.590> Liverpool<00:04:02.800> do<00:04:03.160> need<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.400> sort<00:04:03.790> of

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
still think Liverpool do need a sort of

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.270 
still think Liverpool do need a sort of
a<00:04:04.000> marquee<00:04:04.630> signing<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.170> big<00:04:05.410> name<00:04:05.650> signing<00:04:06.190> if

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
a marquee signing a big name signing if

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.940

Cowell now Falcao he is you know he

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.060 
Cowell now Falcao he is you know he
moved<00:04:30.669> what<00:04:31.090> was<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.360> from<00:04:31.660> Atletico<00:04:32.590> Madrid

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
moved what was it from Atletico Madrid

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.159 
moved what was it from Atletico Madrid
and<00:04:33.340> then<00:04:33.669> he<00:04:33.760> moved<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> ask<00:04:34.210> Monaco<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.990> now

and then he moved to ask Monaco and now

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.840 
and then he moved to ask Monaco and now
it<00:04:35.350> looks<00:04:35.380> like<00:04:35.770> he<00:04:36.010> could<00:04:36.220> be<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.520> his<00:04:36.550> way<00:04:36.700> to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
it looks like he could be on his way to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.909 
it looks like he could be on his way to
Real<00:04:37.270> Madrid<00:04:37.870> although<00:04:38.410> with<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.710> being

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
Real Madrid although with that being

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.280 
Real Madrid although with that being
said<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:40.030> one<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.570> rumors<00:04:41.050> that

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
said this is one of the rumors that

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.440 
said this is one of the rumors that
looks<00:04:41.710> like<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.130> might<00:04:42.160> not<00:04:42.669> actually<00:04:42.850> happen

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
looks like it might not actually happen

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.330 
looks like it might not actually happen
because<00:04:43.600> he<00:04:43.840> did<00:04:44.080> come<00:04:44.560> out<00:04:44.650> on<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.919> other<00:04:45.040> day

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340
