00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.049
 we are here at the presentation of italy's 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.260
 lumia 15 20 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.020
 this is the first smartphone from nokia ad 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.289
 have 6 inches full hd screen 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.269
 so a resolution really 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.390
 sensational and an image quality 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.570
 on the screen today never seen for a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.249
 smartphone of this type 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.470
 we clearly say the 6 screen 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:36.400
 inches an exceptional camera 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:41.109
 because we talk about 20 megapixel pur view 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.660
 then stabilized optics and possibilities 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.190
 to zoom in and out of photos and during 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.539
 also the defense of the videos so me 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.940
 I can safely up to the sea 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.329
 2 for when you stuff the photos and up to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.329
 three for when I take videos 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.370
 the product integrates a lot of battery 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.829
 large because we talk about 3,400 milan 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.719
 lose allows a truly autonomy of 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.510
 very high level and also recharge 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.580
 wireless then backing up the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.479
 terminal directly on a charger 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.690
 Wireless charging this we 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.390
 speaking of battery screen 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.090
 of camera connectivity is at the top 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.340
 because obviously wifi which is obvious but 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.640
 we have 4g connectivity so I can 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.590
 connect to the latest broadband networks 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 of vodafone tim and the Italian operators 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.700
 together 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.210
 today we also present an application 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.780
 new that I explain that it is possible to enjoy 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 now also on the lumia and among other things 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 on a screen like this at 16 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.160
 inch becomes really a lot 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.930
 Interesting 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.970
 now we try it here we are below then 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 make is pretty busy though it should 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.720
 attentions come out while they write to me 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970
 last 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.610
 as you see 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.940
 we are now seeing sky tg24 la 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.220
 quality then fits 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.070
 it adapts according to which it does not make it 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.500
 however wifi is very very heavy 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.120
 this moment therefore and we fail to 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.120
 see it normally however 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.600
 the beauty is to be able to see the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.790
 television and thanks to a cover of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.340
 this type that time precedes phone 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.080
 allows to place it for example on 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 a table and then 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.860
 the table 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.930
 without having to phone to hold i 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.790
 telephones but so this way can 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.950
 support it even when I have always been 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.830
 by train or in any context in which 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.750
 I want to see a very long video there 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.750
 support and I can enjoy the show 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.439
 on other features level 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.689
 important concern the part of all 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.579
 life because obviously being a 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.220
 produced with such a large screen 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.250
 allows him to 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.770
 do things productively 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.170
 therefore of office even when I am in 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.790
 integrated office mobility because windows 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.960
 phone integra office 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.690
 so I can easily open e 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.300
 also edit all excel files 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.960
 without being afraid of losing the format 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.830
 in this case we have a presentation 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.230
 powerpoint 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.690
 I can safely scroll 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.040
 as you see then it makes a lot of the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.050
 made to have such a big screen 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.720
 because I can really share it with 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.940
 different people as I can open 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.590
 an excel file that typically is 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.470
 difficult to use on one 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.770
 smartphone canvas as you see I can 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.610
 easily read the data on excel 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.380
 see the graphs change also some 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.670
 formulas really very very way 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.910
 simple and fast 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.420
 this 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.000
 it's a plus that only on windows phone 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.800
 I can do it because integrated office 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.860
 clearly we have race of the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.820
 camera there are all applications 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.710
 dedicated by nokia to the part of 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.760
 photography so we clearly have the 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.970
 camera with advanced controls that 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.040
 allows you to change all settings 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.260
 in a manual manner 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.590
 basically he can go and throw me 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.360
 my favorite liso can go to 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.550
 change the time available is 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.560
 place to get to 4 second exposures 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.910
 which has something typically on 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.700
 smartphone I can not do it in short 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.560
 only talked about cameras but 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.080
 also quite prut and not all 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.169
 the automatic ones in short 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.729
 who the suite of programs for the 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.490
 really very advanced photography 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.530
 this is the photo crane 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.870
 we also have a whole range of 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.229
 more advanced programs 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.270
 the last one I'll show you a story 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.060
 teller in which basically i 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.390
 allows you to review all images 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.850
 what did I do 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.000
 all the photos I took on one 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.370
 so I can browse the map 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.909
 my photos and see where the part in 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.449
 way 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.449
 very very nice
