between<00:00:18.390> shangri-la<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.199> Cheatham<00:00:19.619> nua<00:00:20.570> so

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
between shangri-la on Cheatham nua so

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.269 
between shangri-la on Cheatham nua so
yeah<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.199> being<00:00:22.439> there's<00:00:22.619> much<00:00:22.769> like

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
yeah that being there's much like

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.670 
yeah that being there's much like
buildings<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> there's<00:00:24.689> an<00:00:24.810> outside<00:00:25.140> area<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
buildings and there's an outside area as

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439 
buildings and there's an outside area as
you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:25.980> see<00:00:26.130> right<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:27.240> is

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
you can see right here which is

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.599 
you can see right here which is
obviously<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> place<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.800> you'd<00:00:29.010> run<00:00:29.279> cuz

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
obviously the place that you'd run cuz

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.370 
obviously the place that you'd run cuz
it's<00:00:29.789> way<00:00:30.090> easier<00:00:30.570> than<00:00:30.599> anything<00:00:30.810> else<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it's way easier than anything else and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's way easier than anything else and
I'm<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.420> shi<00:00:33.420> no<00:00:33.480> numa<00:00:33.570> base<00:00:33.930> map<00:00:34.200> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I'm this is a shi no numa base map so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
I'm this is a shi no numa base map so
you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.000> doing<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> round<00:00:36.450> 50

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you can see here I'm doing the round 50

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
you can see here I'm doing the round 50
thing<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:38.329> things<00:00:39.329> about<00:00:39.690> shi<00:00:40.230> no<00:00:40.469> numa<00:00:40.500> base

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
thing and things about shi no numa base

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.440 
thing and things about shi no numa base
maps<00:00:41.520> um<00:00:41.940> there's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.930> wonder<00:00:43.350> while<00:00:43.559> yeah

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
maps um there's a wonder while yeah

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
maps um there's a wonder while yeah
makes<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.660> much<00:00:45.870> easier<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.500> coming<00:00:46.980> for

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
makes things much easier for coming for

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
makes things much easier for coming for
high<00:00:47.250> rounds<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
high rounds because you can see if you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
high rounds because you can see if you
just<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.190> long<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.579> round<00:00:50.789> takes<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
just time how long this round takes I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
just time how long this round takes I
don't<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:52.079> respond<00:00:52.469> Winkler's<00:00:52.980> may<00:00:53.460> be

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
don't know not respond Winkler's may be

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.020 
don't know not respond Winkler's may be
annoying<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> very<00:00:55.440> short<00:00:55.800> realm

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
annoying but up it's a very short realm

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
annoying but up it's a very short realm
and<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.180> you'll<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.510> yeah<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:58.590> means

50<00:01:10.170> trust<00:01:10.740> map<00:01:10.979> stuff<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.760> have

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
50 trust map stuff is because I have

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
50 trust map stuff is because I have
enough<00:01:12.090> had<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.840> long<00:01:12.960> time

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
enough had one of these in a long time

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.480 
enough had one of these in a long time
so<00:01:13.740> I'll<00:01:14.490> explain<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.689> an<00:01:16.140> acht<00:01:16.439> brooked<00:01:17.189> or

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so I'll explain it on an acht brooked or

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
so I'll explain it on an acht brooked or
shi<00:01:18.000> no<00:01:18.119> numa<00:01:18.150> base<00:01:18.570> map<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.290> doing<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
shi no numa base map what I'm doing is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.060 
shi no numa base map what I'm doing is
going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> around<00:01:20.460> 50<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.810> um<00:01:22.110> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
going to around 50 because um that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.370 
going to around 50 because um that's
that's<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> point<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.360> which<00:01:24.540> pretty<00:01:25.290> much

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's the point at which pretty much

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.190 
that's the point at which pretty much
mastered<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.070> map<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.460> won't<00:01:26.610> die<00:01:27.170> too<00:01:28.170> soon

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
mastered the map you won't die too soon

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.940 
mastered the map you won't die too soon
hopefully<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:30.030> I'm<00:01:30.210> yeah<00:01:30.869> yeah<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.799> like

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
hopefully but I'm yeah yeah I just like

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
hopefully but I'm yeah yeah I just like

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.780 
stopping at 50 on these festive apps
it's<00:01:34.350> good<00:01:34.590> goal<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.630> that's<00:01:36.630> only<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.170> those
