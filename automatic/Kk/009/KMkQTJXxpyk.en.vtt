DSLR guide so lighting is a really

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.640 
DSLR guide so lighting is a really
important<00:00:21.240> aspect<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.689> filmmaking<00:00:21.960> it's

important aspect of filmmaking it's

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
important aspect of filmmaking it's
something<00:00:22.949> which<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.490> lighting<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.880> bad

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
something which if your lighting is bad

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
something which if your lighting is bad
then<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> will<00:00:24.779> really<00:00:25.019> show<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.250> your

footage and having just a couple of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.439 
footage and having just a couple of
simple<00:00:29.130> steps<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.640> actually<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.359> your

footage look way way more professional

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
footage look way way more professional
so<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.390> showing<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.870> a

so I'm going to be showing you just a
couple<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.680> setups<00:00:35.180> some<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.300> daylight<00:00:36.660> some

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
couple of setups some in daylight some

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
couple of setups some in daylight some
in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> evening<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.670> big

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
in the evening which I think are big

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
in the evening which I think are big
improvements<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> natural

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
improvements on the kind of natural

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
improvements on the kind of natural
lighting<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.700> already<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
lighting that was there already so the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
lighting that was there already so the
first<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> relatively<00:00:44.160> simple<00:00:44.340> shot

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
first one is a relatively simple shot

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910 
first one is a relatively simple shot
we've<00:00:45.300> got<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.629> subject<00:00:46.050> looking<00:00:46.710> from

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we've got the subject looking from

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.250 
we've got the subject looking from
camera<00:00:47.219> left<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.640> camera<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> they

camera left to camera right and they

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.220 
camera left to camera right and they
have<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:50.399> laptop<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.210> also<00:00:51.480> putting<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
have a laptop which is also putting a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.720 
have a laptop which is also putting a
bit<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> light<00:00:52.559> onto<00:00:52.680> their<00:00:52.860> face<00:00:53.039> now<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
bit of light onto their face now this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
bit of light onto their face now this
shot<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.149> his<00:00:54.539> own<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.320> dark

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
shot on his own because it was so dark

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.639 
shot on his own because it was so dark
in<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.190> room<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.579> had<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.649> tungsten

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
in that room I had just the tungsten

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.000 
in that room I had just the tungsten
bulb<00:00:59.090> that<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.329> line<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.719> room<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
bulb that was in line in that room and I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
bulb that was in line in that room and I
was<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.250> ISO<00:01:02.760> 800<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.780> pretty<00:01:03.989> dark

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
was at ISO 800 so it was pretty dark

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.130 
was at ISO 800 so it was pretty dark
we're<00:01:04.650> getting<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> pretty<00:01:05.540> nasty<00:01:06.540> image<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
we're getting a pretty nasty image and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
we're getting a pretty nasty image and
the<00:01:07.409> lighting<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.830> pretty<00:01:08.460> flat<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:08.970> so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the lighting is pretty flat really so

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.789 
the lighting is pretty flat really so
for<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.930> shot<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> lighting<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.590> pretty

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
for this shot the lighting was pretty

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
for this shot the lighting was pretty
simple<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> added<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.760> ring<00:01:11.939> light<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
simple I just added in my ring light and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
simple I just added in my ring light and
put<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.080> line<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.619> laptop<00:01:13.979> because

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
put it in line with the laptop because

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
put it in line with the laptop because
the<00:01:14.760> laptop<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.479> already<00:01:15.810> giving<00:01:16.110> us<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> bit

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the laptop was already giving us a bit

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840 
the laptop was already giving us a bit
of<00:01:16.500> light<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.920> thought<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of light so I thought I would kind of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
of light so I thought I would kind of
enhance<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
enhance this a little bit to make it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.580 
enhance this a little bit to make it
look<00:01:19.650> natural<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.350> begin

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
look natural and you can see to begin

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.230 
look natural and you can see to begin
with<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.159> looks<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.610> bad<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.119> I'm

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
with it looks pretty bad because I'm

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
with it looks pretty bad because I'm
going<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:24.540> fusion<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
going into fusion on it but then when I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
going into fusion on it but then when I
throw<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.310> diffusion<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
throw some diffusion on there the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
throw some diffusion on there the
lighting<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.560> pleasant<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
lighting is actually quite pleasant on

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
lighting is actually quite pleasant on
the<00:01:29.340> face<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> main<00:01:30.360> thing<00:01:30.509> we're

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the face so that's the main thing we're

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
the face so that's the main thing we're
looking<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.470> face<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
looking at is the face and then the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.460 
looking at is the face and then the
other<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> background<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.350> got

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
other things the background so we got

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
other things the background so we got
some<00:01:34.590> nice<00:01:34.710> soft<00:01:35.369> lighting<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> face<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
some nice soft lighting on the face and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.230 
some nice soft lighting on the face and
then<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:38.310> order<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> make<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> background<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
then in order to make the background a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330 
then in order to make the background a
bit<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.479> interesting<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.950> added<00:01:41.130> in

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
bit more interesting I just added in

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.030 
bit more interesting I just added in
this<00:01:41.490> lamp<00:01:41.759> which<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.930> tungsten<00:01:43.829> bulb

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
this lamp which was also a tungsten bulb

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
this lamp which was also a tungsten bulb
and<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:45.509> gives<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> bit<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.200> interest

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and that gives you a bit more interest

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460 
and that gives you a bit more interest
in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.549> background<00:01:47.970> makes<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> bit<00:01:49.290> more

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in the background makes it a bit more

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.249 
in the background makes it a bit more
visually<00:01:49.860> appealing<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.869> kind<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.930> fills<00:01:52.140> up

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
visually appealing and kind of fills up

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.340 
visually appealing and kind of fills up
the<00:01:52.380> frame<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.820> also<00:01:53.970> helps<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.600> light

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the frame and that also helps to light

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.649 
the frame and that also helps to light
up<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.860> bookcase<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> background<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
up the bookcase in the background so you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.469 
up the bookcase in the background so you
can<00:01:57.869> see<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.380> by<00:01:59.030> thinking<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
can see that just by thinking about the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.899 
can see that just by thinking about the
positioning<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:00.990> light<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.790> adding<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
positioning of your light and adding in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.389 
positioning of your light and adding in
some<00:02:03.090> soft<00:02:03.329> light<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.530> brighter<00:02:04.770> we

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
some soft light that's a bit brighter we

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.290 
some soft light that's a bit brighter we
can<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:06.200> an<00:02:07.200> ISO<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.979> 160<00:02:08.610> we've<00:02:09.149> got<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
can now use an ISO of 160 we've got a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029 
can now use an ISO of 160 we've got a
much<00:02:09.450> cleaner<00:02:09.720> image<00:02:10.110> with<00:02:10.379> much<00:02:10.830> more

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
much cleaner image with much more

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.089 
much cleaner image with much more
interesting<00:02:11.489> lighting

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
interesting lighting

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.309 
interesting lighting
so<00:02:12.519> for<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.700> second<00:02:13.030> set<00:02:13.150> up<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:13.870> was<00:02:14.079> pretty

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
so for the second set up it was pretty

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.989 
so for the second set up it was pretty
similar<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.680> start<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.159> we<00:02:15.340> had<00:02:15.489> fluorescent

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
similar to start with we had fluorescent

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.599 
similar to start with we had fluorescent
room<00:02:16.900> lighting<00:02:17.290> which<00:02:17.799> was<00:02:17.980> again<00:02:18.370> pretty

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
room lighting which was again pretty

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.319 
room lighting which was again pretty
poor<00:02:18.939> and<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:20.079> had<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.349> go<00:02:20.439> to<00:02:20.499> ISO<00:02:21.099> 800<00:02:21.639> so<00:02:22.299> I

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
poor and we had to go to ISO 800 so I

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.929 
poor and we had to go to ISO 800 so I
added<00:02:22.569> in<00:02:22.719> the<00:02:23.560> same<00:02:23.739> light<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.189> just<00:02:24.400> put<00:02:24.819> it

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
added in the same light I just put it

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.500 
added in the same light I just put it
quite<00:02:25.810> high<00:02:26.019> up<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.430> pointing<00:02:27.430> downwards<00:02:27.879> but

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
quite high up and pointing downwards but

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.179 
quite high up and pointing downwards but
from<00:02:28.750> behind<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:29.709> see<00:02:29.739> from<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.069> diagram

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
from behind you can see from the diagram

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.539 
from behind you can see from the diagram
where<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.389> but<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.049> essentially<00:02:32.439> is<00:02:32.769> on

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
where it is but it essentially is on

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.170 
where it is but it essentially is on
camera<00:02:34.090> left<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.639> kind<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:36.939> creating

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
camera left and this is kind of creating

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.000 
camera left and this is kind of creating
a<00:02:37.239> rim<00:02:37.450> light<00:02:37.480> rim<00:02:38.379> light<00:02:38.560> something<00:02:38.799> that's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
a rim light rim light something that's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.949 
a rim light rim light something that's
really<00:02:39.340> important<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.909> films<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.719> makes<00:02:40.840> them

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
really important to films and makes them

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.220 
really important to films and makes them
look<00:02:40.989> really<00:02:42.749> distinctive<00:02:43.749> and<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:43.959> kind<00:02:44.139> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
look really distinctive and it kind of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.470 
look really distinctive and it kind of
separates<00:02:44.859> them<00:02:44.980> from<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.219> background<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.790> I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
separates them from the background and I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.179 
separates them from the background and I
think<00:02:46.659> it's<00:02:46.750> quite<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.930> professional<00:02:47.409> look<00:02:47.560> but

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
think it's quite a professional look but

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
think it's quite a professional look but
obviously<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.730> need<00:02:48.909> something<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.359> light<00:02:51.209> up

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
obviously we need something to light up

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.300 
obviously we need something to light up
the<00:02:52.299> face<00:02:52.510> as<00:02:52.689> well<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:53.829> when<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.069> added

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
the face as well so that's when I added

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.899 
the face as well so that's when I added
in<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:55.530> reflector<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.459> kind<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.669> see<00:02:57.819> the

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
in a reflector you can kind of see the

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.789 
in a reflector you can kind of see the
reflector<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.419> shot<00:02:58.629> but<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:59.319> reflector

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
reflector in the shot but this reflector

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.439 
reflector in the shot but this reflector
just<00:03:00.010> bounces<00:03:00.370> some<00:03:00.519> really<00:03:00.760> soft<00:03:00.969> light<00:03:01.239> onto

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:01.449 
just bounces some really soft light onto

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.009 
just bounces some really soft light onto
the<00:03:01.599> face<00:03:01.780> because<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.829> using<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.189> white

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
the face because I was using the white

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.599 
the face because I was using the white
side<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.199> reflector<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.219> we<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.370> hard

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
side of the reflector so we have hard

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.789 
side of the reflector so we have hard
light<00:03:06.790> coming<00:03:07.120> from<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:08.049> back<00:03:08.260> which<00:03:08.769> gives

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
light coming from the back which gives

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.830 
light coming from the back which gives
us<00:03:09.129> a<00:03:09.219> really<00:03:09.370> strong<00:03:09.730> rim<00:03:10.030> light<00:03:10.209> which

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
us a really strong rim light which

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.479 
us a really strong rim light which
bounces<00:03:10.870> off<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.319> reflector<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.069> turns<00:03:12.340> into

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
bounces off the reflector and turns into

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.159 
bounces off the reflector and turns into
soft<00:03:12.790> light<00:03:12.969> on<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.150> face<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.870> think<00:03:14.079> this

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
soft light on the face and I think this

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.099 
soft light on the face and I think this
gives<00:03:14.379> you<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.769> really<00:03:15.159> really<00:03:15.400> nice<00:03:15.579> look<00:03:16.109> the

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
gives you a really really nice look the

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.319 
gives you a really really nice look the
light<00:03:17.290> beyond<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.590> face<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:17.949> so<00:03:18.129> soft<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
light beyond the face is so soft but it

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.179 
light beyond the face is so soft but it
still<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.750> bright<00:03:20.049> enough<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.379> be<00:03:20.560> used<00:03:20.799> up<00:03:21.009> by

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
still is bright enough to be used up by

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.819 
still is bright enough to be used up by
say<00:03:21.579> 160<00:03:21.909> and<00:03:22.329> again<00:03:23.079> with<00:03:23.259> the<00:03:23.349> reflection<00:03:23.739> in

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
say 160 and again with the reflection in

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.349 
say 160 and again with the reflection in
the<00:03:23.859> glasses<00:03:24.129> I<00:03:24.430> think<00:03:24.849> this<00:03:24.970> works<00:03:25.150> quite

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
the glasses I think this works quite

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.719 
the glasses I think this works quite
well<00:03:25.389> this<00:03:26.319> is<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> technique<00:03:26.859> which<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.609> use

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:27.729 
well this is a technique which I use

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.719 
well this is a technique which I use
quite<00:03:27.909> a<00:03:27.970> lot<00:03:28.209> whether<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.259> have<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.739> light

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
quite a lot whether you have a light

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.569 
quite a lot whether you have a light
source<00:03:31.000> as<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.479> rim<00:03:32.109> light<00:03:32.319> or<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.829> window<00:03:33.430> like

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
source as the rim light or a window like

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.170 
source as the rim light or a window like
I<00:03:33.639> have<00:03:33.819> in<00:03:33.909> this<00:03:34.030> case<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:35.500> use<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
I have in this case you can just use the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.550 
I have in this case you can just use the
window<00:03:37.389> as<00:03:37.509> a<00:03:37.540> backlight<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.079> then<00:03:38.169> reflect

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
window as a backlight and then reflect

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.909 
window as a backlight and then reflect
it<00:03:38.939> forwards<00:03:39.939> as<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.150> key<00:03:40.419> and<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:41.650> doesn't

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
it forwards as a key and this doesn't

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.770 
it forwards as a key and this doesn't
it's<00:03:42.220> not<00:03:42.280> perfect<00:03:42.819> for<00:03:42.909> all<00:03:42.970> situations<00:03:43.209> but

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
it's not perfect for all situations but

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.960 
it's not perfect for all situations but
it's<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.019> bit<00:03:44.169> different<00:03:44.379> as<00:03:45.340> opposed<00:03:45.669> to<00:03:45.790> just

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
it's a bit different as opposed to just

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.939 
it's a bit different as opposed to just
having<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.479> simple<00:03:46.689> key<00:03:47.169> light<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.560> next<00:03:47.799> shot

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
having a simple key light the next shot

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.509 
having a simple key light the next shot
we've<00:03:48.099> got<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.459> wider<00:03:49.120> shot<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.569> time<00:03:49.840> and

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
we've got a wider shot this time and

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.249 
we've got a wider shot this time and
it's<00:03:51.519> in<00:03:51.669> daylight<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:52.930> see<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:53.199> if

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:53.259 
it's in daylight so you can see that if

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.709 
it's in daylight so you can see that if
I<00:03:53.379> expose<00:03:53.709> for<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.009> face<00:03:54.250> arm<00:03:54.579> you<00:03:55.389> actually

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
I expose for the face arm you actually

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.420 
I expose for the face arm you actually
lose<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:56.109> lot<00:03:56.469> of<00:03:56.500> detail<00:03:56.889> in<00:03:57.009> the<00:03:57.099> highlights

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
lose a lot of detail in the highlights

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.390 
lose a lot of detail in the highlights
out<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.030> window<00:03:58.299> especially<00:03:59.009> and<00:04:00.009> again

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
out the window especially and again

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.159 
out the window especially and again
where<00:04:00.549> happen<00:04:00.759> to<00:04:00.819> be<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:00.939> ISO<00:04:01.449> 800<00:04:01.870> in<00:04:01.959> order<00:04:02.079> to

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
where happen to be a ISO 800 in order to

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.839 
where happen to be a ISO 800 in order to
get<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.409> exposure<00:04:02.709> up<00:04:03.009> so<00:04:03.639> this<00:04:03.790> is

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
get that exposure up so this is

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.179 
get that exposure up so this is
generally<00:04:04.329> not<00:04:04.509> the<00:04:05.319> best<00:04:05.620> shot<00:04:05.919> although<00:04:06.069> you

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
generally not the best shot although you

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.399 
generally not the best shot although you
have<00:04:06.430> got<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.669> lot<00:04:06.909> of<00:04:06.939> nice<00:04:07.209> soft<00:04:07.900> light<00:04:08.109> coming

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
have got a lot of nice soft light coming

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.399 
have got a lot of nice soft light coming
from<00:04:08.439> the<00:04:08.620> window<00:04:08.849> due<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.969> being<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.479> overcast

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
from the window due to being a overcast

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.649 
from the window due to being a overcast
day<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.459> rather<00:04:13.329> than<00:04:13.599> adding<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:15.419> light<00:04:16.419> on

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
day so rather than adding a light on

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.939 
day so rather than adding a light on
camera<00:04:17.259> right<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.680> kind<00:04:18.009> of<00:04:18.269> losing<00:04:19.269> that

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
camera right and kind of losing that

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.269 
camera right and kind of losing that
window<00:04:20.949> light<00:04:21.159> and<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.969> stay<00:04:22.150> just<00:04:22.360> going<00:04:22.719> to

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
window light and I stay just going to

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.860 
window light and I stay just going to
bump<00:04:24.279> down<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.550> ISO<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.880> 160<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:25.659> can

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
bump down the ISO to 160 and you can

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.260 
bump down the ISO to 160 and you can
now<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.590> face<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.040> pretty<00:04:27.370> dark<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:28.150> we

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
now that the face is pretty dark but we

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.300 
now that the face is pretty dark but we
do<00:04:28.389> have<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.780> detail<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.500> window<00:04:30.130> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
do have the detail in the window and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.740 
do have the detail in the window and
then<00:04:31.120> all<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.840> did<00:04:32.320> was<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.530> handed<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:32.979> light

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
then all I did was I handed a light

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.850 
then all I did was I handed a light
pretty<00:04:34.750> much<00:04:34.900> as<00:04:35.110> close<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.500> window<00:04:35.710> as<00:04:35.800> I

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
pretty much as close to the window as I

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.260 
pretty much as close to the window as I
could<00:04:36.010> get<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.580> it's<00:04:36.729> on<00:04:36.820> camera<00:04:37.030> left

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
could get it so it's on camera left

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.750 
could get it so it's on camera left
again<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.290> subject<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:38.889> looking<00:04:39.040> from<00:04:39.370> camera

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
again the subject is looking from camera

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.670 
again the subject is looking from camera
right<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.090> camera<00:04:40.360> left<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.139> put<00:04:41.290> a<00:04:41.320> light

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
right to camera left so we put a light

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.280 
right to camera left so we put a light
on<00:04:41.889> the<00:04:42.010> left<00:04:42.220> which<00:04:42.910> gives<00:04:43.180> us<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.660> brightest

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
on the left which gives us the brightest

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.050 
on the left which gives us the brightest
part<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.650> middle<00:04:44.919> this<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.430> kind<00:04:45.850> of<00:04:45.910> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
part in the middle this is kind of the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.370 
part in the middle this is kind of the
rule<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.330> thumb<00:04:46.510> you<00:04:46.540> want<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.810> follow<00:04:46.960> most<00:04:47.199> of

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
rule of thumb you want to follow most of

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.000 
rule of thumb you want to follow most of
the<00:04:47.440> time<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:48.160> is<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.370> most<00:04:48.610> common<00:04:50.010> setup

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
the time this is the most common setup

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.790 
the time this is the most common setup
and<00:04:51.220> again<00:04:52.030> when<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.360> had<00:04:52.570> diffusion<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.290> can

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
and again when I had diffusion you can

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.930 
and again when I had diffusion you can
see<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:54.070> this<00:04:54.160> actually<00:04:54.550> looks<00:04:54.760> quite

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
see that this actually looks quite

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.640 
see that this actually looks quite
natural<00:04:55.180> because<00:04:55.510> we've<00:04:55.780> got<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.380> can<00:04:56.500> see

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
natural because we've got you can see

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.200 
natural because we've got you can see
the<00:04:56.770> window<00:04:57.040> there<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.520> makes<00:04:57.699> sense<00:04:57.970> that

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
the window there so it makes sense that

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.550 
the window there so it makes sense that
the<00:04:58.330> light<00:04:58.510> source<00:04:58.780> would<00:04:58.960> be<00:04:59.020> coming<00:04:59.320> from

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
the light source would be coming from

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.219 
the light source would be coming from
the<00:05:00.310> window<00:05:00.789> from<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.690> direction<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.169> the

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
the window from the direction of the

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.379 
the window from the direction of the
window<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:03.340> is<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.490> very<00:05:03.789> natural<00:05:04.210> look

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
window so this is a very natural look

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.510 
window so this is a very natural look
and<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:05.229> think<00:05:05.440> even<00:05:05.650> though<00:05:05.889> it<00:05:06.010> is<00:05:06.100> artificial

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
and I think even though it is artificial

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.730 
and I think even though it is artificial
like<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.030> almost<00:05:07.210> looks<00:05:07.539> as<00:05:07.690> if<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.020> light<00:05:08.590> is

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
like it almost looks as if the light is

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.529 
like it almost looks as if the light is
coming<00:05:08.979> from<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.280> window<00:05:09.370> it's<00:05:10.030> not<00:05:10.210> quite<00:05:10.419> as

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
coming from the window it's not quite as

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.420 
coming from the window it's not quite as
soft<00:05:10.690> as<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.080> original<00:05:11.470> light<00:05:11.650> but<00:05:12.250> it's

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
soft as the original light but it's

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.750 
soft as the original light but it's
bright<00:05:12.669> enough<00:05:12.699> that<00:05:12.940> we<00:05:13.150> can<00:05:13.330> be<00:05:13.979> iso<00:05:14.979> 160<00:05:15.340> and

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
bright enough that we can be iso 160 and

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.810 
bright enough that we can be iso 160 and
then<00:05:16.660> finally<00:05:17.130> in<00:05:18.130> order<00:05:18.250> to<00:05:18.430> give<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> bit<00:05:18.789> of

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
then finally in order to give a bit of

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.640 
then finally in order to give a bit of
rim<00:05:19.030> light<00:05:19.240> but<00:05:19.539> mostly<00:05:19.810> just<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:20.139> make<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.350> a

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
rim light but mostly just to make it a

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.490 
rim light but mostly just to make it a
bit<00:05:21.639> more<00:05:21.789> open<00:05:22.539> in<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.720> background<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.289> just

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
bit more open in the background I just

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.439 
bit more open in the background I just
open<00:05:23.949> those<00:05:24.100> blinds<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.639> then<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.150> can<00:05:25.300> see

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
open those blinds and then you can see

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.110 
open those blinds and then you can see
it's<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.870> much<00:05:26.080> more<00:05:26.380> pleasing<00:05:26.710> shot<00:05:27.130> this<00:05:27.940> has

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
it's a much more pleasing shot this has

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.790 
it's a much more pleasing shot this has
a<00:05:28.150> really<00:05:28.330> bright<00:05:28.539> and<00:05:28.900> warm<00:05:29.139> tone<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.680> it

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
a really bright and warm tone to it

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.050 
a really bright and warm tone to it
which<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:30.370> think<00:05:30.430> works<00:05:30.669> quite<00:05:30.880> well

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
which I think works quite well

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.750 
which I think works quite well
so<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.960> final<00:05:32.229> one<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:32.410> pretty<00:05:32.590> simple<00:05:32.800> to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
so the final one is pretty simple to

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.640 
so the final one is pretty simple to
start<00:05:33.940> with<00:05:34.150> where<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.419> just<00:05:34.599> had<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.470> natural

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
start with where it just had the natural

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.620 
start with where it just had the natural
room<00:05:35.950> lights<00:05:36.220> which<00:05:36.520> are<00:05:36.880> pretty<00:05:37.090> horrible<00:05:37.300> to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
room lights which are pretty horrible to

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.379 
room lights which are pretty horrible to
be<00:05:37.720> honest<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:39.520> again<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:39.849> was<00:05:39.940> quite<00:05:40.210> dark

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
be honest and so again it was quite dark

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.930 
be honest and so again it was quite dark
so<00:05:40.570> we<00:05:40.660> had<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.840> be<00:05:40.930> at<00:05:41.020> iso<00:05:41.289> 800<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:42.370> if<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:42.789> drop

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
so we had to be at iso 800 so if I drop

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.909 
so we had to be at iso 800 so if I drop
the<00:05:43.060> ISO<00:05:43.330> down<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.660> 160<00:05:44.169> you<00:05:44.289> can<00:05:44.410> see<00:05:44.560> how<00:05:44.740> dark

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
the ISO down to 160 you can see how dark

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.060 
the ISO down to 160 you can see how dark
it<00:05:45.099> was<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.490> then<00:05:46.270> all<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:46.870> did<00:05:47.139> was<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.410> added

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
it was and then all I did was just added

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.469 
it was and then all I did was just added
a<00:05:48.539> simple<00:05:49.620> key<00:05:50.620> light<00:05:50.800> on<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:52.060> camera<00:05:52.330> left

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
a simple key light on to camera left

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.240 
a simple key light on to camera left
again<00:05:52.810> because<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.440> main<00:05:53.650> subject<00:05:54.099> is

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
again because the main subject is

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.939 
again because the main subject is
looking<00:05:54.610> to<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:54.940> left<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.740> with<00:05:56.740> some

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
looking to the left and with some

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.279 
looking to the left and with some
diffusion<00:05:57.340> on<00:05:57.430> there<00:05:57.639> actually<00:05:58.360> again<00:05:59.050> gives

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
diffusion on there actually again gives

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.400 
diffusion on there actually again gives
us<00:05:59.410> quite<00:05:59.740> a<00:06:00.599> pleasing<00:06:01.599> look<00:06:01.750> which<00:06:01.930> is<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.289> was

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
us quite a pleasing look which is it was

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.800 
us quite a pleasing look which is it was
just<00:06:02.620> so<00:06:02.800> simple<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.370> literally<00:06:04.300> just<00:06:04.539> put<00:06:04.720> it

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
just so simple I literally just put it

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.170 
just so simple I literally just put it
on<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:04.990> left<00:06:05.199> and<00:06:05.440> pointing<00:06:05.800> at<00:06:05.889> them<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.220> it

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
on the left and pointing at them and it

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.879 
on the left and pointing at them and it
gave<00:06:07.330> us<00:06:07.360> so<00:06:07.570> much<00:06:07.720> better<00:06:07.990> look<00:06:08.199> you<00:06:08.620> can<00:06:08.740> see

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
gave us so much better look you can see

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.930 
gave us so much better look you can see
that<00:06:09.099> from<00:06:09.610> these<00:06:10.289> comparisons<00:06:11.289> that<00:06:11.940> without

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
that from these comparisons that without

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.020 
that from these comparisons that without
the<00:06:13.090> light<00:06:13.270> um<00:06:13.510> it's<00:06:14.380> quite<00:06:14.620> bland<00:06:14.979> also<00:06:15.820> being

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
the light um it's quite bland also being

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.879 
the light um it's quite bland also being
a<00:06:16.120> bit<00:06:16.270> noisy<00:06:16.419> in<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.810> bit<00:06:16.990> you<00:06:17.530> lose<00:06:17.680> some<00:06:17.860> of

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
a bit noisy in a bit you lose some of

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.740 
a bit noisy in a bit you lose some of
the<00:06:18.010> dynamic<00:06:18.400> range<00:06:18.520> whereas<00:06:19.300> with<00:06:19.479> the<00:06:19.599> light

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
the dynamic range whereas with the light

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.460 
the dynamic range whereas with the light
you<00:06:19.960> get<00:06:20.500> some<00:06:20.710> nice<00:06:20.949> soft<00:06:21.729> shadows<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.419> a<00:06:22.479> bit

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
you get some nice soft shadows and a bit

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.320 
you get some nice soft shadows and a bit
more<00:06:23.620> interest<00:06:23.889> to<00:06:24.160> it<00:06:24.370> okay<00:06:24.820> so<00:06:25.000> those<00:06:25.090> are<00:06:25.240> my

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
more interest to it okay so those are my

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.629 
more interest to it okay so those are my
four<00:06:25.389> setups<00:06:25.870> so<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.500> can<00:06:26.650> see<00:06:26.800> that<00:06:26.979> by<00:06:27.430> just

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
four setups so you can see that by just

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.250 
four setups so you can see that by just
having<00:06:27.760> one<00:06:28.060> light<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.599> a<00:06:28.750> bit<00:06:28.870> of<00:06:28.930> diffusion

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
having one light and a bit of diffusion

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.890 
having one light and a bit of diffusion
you<00:06:29.560> can<00:06:30.220> actually<00:06:30.370> change<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:31.419> image<00:06:31.630> quite

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
you can actually change the image quite

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.380 
you can actually change the image quite
a<00:06:31.930> lot<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.680> can<00:06:32.830> get<00:06:32.979> your<00:06:33.099> ISO<00:06:33.490> down<00:06:33.729> lower

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
a lot you can get your ISO down lower

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.610 
a lot you can get your ISO down lower
which<00:06:34.630> will<00:06:34.750> give<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:34.960> a<00:06:34.990> generally<00:06:35.440> nice<00:06:35.590> I

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
which will give you a generally nice I

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.180 
which will give you a generally nice I
am

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
am

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.740 
am
and<00:06:36.310> you<00:06:36.550> can<00:06:36.670> actually<00:06:36.790> make<00:06:37.450> some<00:06:37.480> really

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
and you can actually make some really

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.650 
and you can actually make some really
interesting<00:06:38.080> effects<00:06:38.860> see<00:06:39.610> that's<00:06:39.790> it<00:06:39.940> I<00:06:40.210> hope

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
interesting effects see that's it I hope

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.940 
interesting effects see that's it I hope
you've<00:06:40.840> enjoyed<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:41.380> 50th<00:06:41.920> video<00:06:42.570> and<00:06:43.950> I'll
