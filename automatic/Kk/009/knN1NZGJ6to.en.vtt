00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
random person and I believe was because

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.110

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
up there but um anyways back to the

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.570 
up there but um anyways back to the
Hummer<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.860> speedometer<00:04:40.860> goes<00:04:40.979> up<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.250> 120

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580

which<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.600> don't<00:04:42.660> believe<00:04:42.840> well<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.919> guess<00:04:44.250> I

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
which I don't believe well I guess I

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.409 
which I don't believe well I guess I
could<00:04:44.460> believe<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:44.910> could<00:04:45.000> reach<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.360> I

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
could believe it could reach that I

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:56.830 
could believe it could reach that I
doubt<00:04:45.720> it
