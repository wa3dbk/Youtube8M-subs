00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
the antioxidants the most pumps

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.700 
the antioxidants the most pumps
antioxidant<00:01:10.520> they<00:01:10.580> have<00:01:10.700> come<00:01:11.150> on<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.720> plane

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
antioxidant they have come on a plane

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.910 
antioxidant they have come on a plane
and<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:13.790> it<00:01:13.970> really<00:01:14.240> helps<00:01:14.630> as<00:01:15.560> far<00:01:15.590> as

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
and so it really helps as far as

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.550 
and so it really helps as far as
antiaging<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.150> things<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:17.930> nature<00:01:18.020> it's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
antiaging and things of that nature it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.180 
antiaging and things of that nature it's
also<00:01:18.650> anti-inflammatory<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:20.360> um<00:01:20.860> also<00:01:21.860> has

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
also anti-inflammatory so um also has

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.100 
also anti-inflammatory so um also has
caffeine<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.910> it<00:01:23.450> doesn't<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:23.810> apply<00:01:23.930> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
caffeine and it doesn't that apply the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.070 
caffeine and it doesn't that apply the
average<00:01:24.560> 200<00:01:25.070> milligrams<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.670> has<00:01:25.820> like<00:01:26.080> 135

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
average 200 milligrams it has like 135

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.560 
average 200 milligrams it has like 135
so<00:01:27.620> if<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.310> get<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.610> jitters<00:01:28.850> or<00:01:29.060> whatever<00:01:29.390> it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
so if you get the jitters or whatever it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.910 
so if you get the jitters or whatever it
