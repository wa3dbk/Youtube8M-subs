00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.990 

so<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.949> how<00:00:02.220> it<00:00:02.280> looks

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so this is how it looks

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.400 
so this is how it looks
why<00:00:03.470> 3,000<00:00:04.470> without<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.670> case<00:00:06.200> this<00:00:07.200> is

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
why 3,000 without the case this is

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.120 
why 3,000 without the case this is
really<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.189> smallest<00:00:09.200> HD<00:00:10.200> camera<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
really the smallest HD camera in the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.470 
really the smallest HD camera in the
world<00:00:11.309> because<00:00:13.519> maybe<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:14.880> not<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
world because maybe it's not the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.269 
world because maybe it's not the
smallest<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.260> body<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:19.279> poor

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
smallest in the body but this poor

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.950 
smallest in the body but this poor
socket<00:00:21.060> bone<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.840> smallest<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:24.630> lens

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
socket bone is the smallest and the lens

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.790 
socket bone is the smallest and the lens
module<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.539> some<00:00:27.539> big<00:00:28.460> piece<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> plastic<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
module is some big piece of plastic but

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.220 
module is some big piece of plastic but
the<00:00:31.800> used<00:00:32.099> part<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.730> only<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.239> top<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.870> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the used part is only the top of this so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.160 
the used part is only the top of this so
you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.739> cut<00:00:35.070> off<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.579> bottom<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.930> I'm

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
you can cut off the bottom which I'm

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
you can cut off the bottom which I'm
going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.370> empty<00:00:38.790> inside<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.910> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
going to do it's empty inside and the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.540 
going to do it's empty inside and the
bottom<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.809> is<00:00:45.809> really

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
bottom of this thing this one is really

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.410 
bottom of this thing this one is really
heavy<00:00:48.890> almost<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.100> heavy<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> battery

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
heavy almost as heavy as the battery

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.650 
heavy almost as heavy as the battery
actually<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.440> these<00:00:52.620> batteries

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
actually this is not these batteries

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
actually this is not these batteries
it's<00:00:54.660> even<00:00:54.960> smaller<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.680> barrel<00:00:55.980> which

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's even smaller than the barrel which

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
it's even smaller than the barrel which
was<00:00:56.430> inside<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.420> body<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.660> body

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
was inside of this body and the body

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.789 
was inside of this body and the body
adds<00:01:01.890> some<00:01:02.850> maybe<00:01:03.949> maybe<00:01:04.949> 5<00:01:05.280> 7<00:01:06.119> grams<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
adds some maybe maybe 5 7 grams so we

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
adds some maybe maybe 5 7 grams so we
have<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> remove<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> use

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
have to remove it if you want to use

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
have to remove it if you want to use
this<00:01:10.619> thing<00:01:11.150> on<00:01:12.150> small<00:01:13.430> quadcopter<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> small

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
this thing on small quadcopter and small

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:25.490 
this thing on small quadcopter and small
vehicle<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.650> attached<00:01:20.509> jst<00:01:22.909> connector<00:01:24.500> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
vehicle so I attached jst connector to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.910 
vehicle so I attached jst connector to
to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:27.590> female<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.240> board<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.229> male<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
to the female to the board and male to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.740 
to the female to the board and male to
the<00:01:31.950> battery<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.020> should<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:35.030> meaning<00:01:36.030> jst<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the battery I should use meaning jst I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.130 
the battery I should use meaning jst I
know<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:38.579> place<00:01:38.850> had<00:01:39.060> some<00:01:39.090> maybe<00:01:39.659> one

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
know that this place had some maybe one

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.030 
know that this place had some maybe one
gram<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> after<00:01:42.000> removing<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> body<00:01:43.040> suits

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
gram but after removing the body suits

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.120 
gram but after removing the body suits
me<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.000> easier<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.799> plug<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
me because it's easier to plug and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.969 
me because it's easier to plug and
unplug<00:01:47.329> this<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> connector<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.979> I'm

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
unplug this kind of connector so I'm

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
unplug this kind of connector so I'm
going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.520> attach<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.149> thing<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:56.030> b95<00:01:57.030> 9

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
going to attach this thing to my b95 9

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.930 
going to attach this thing to my b95 9
chord<00:01:57.840> core<00:01:58.110> tell<00:01:58.380> me

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
chord core tell me

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.150 
chord core tell me
the<00:01:59.330> other<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.980> want<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.850> be<00:02:03.160> easily

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
the other and I want this to be easily

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.230 
the other and I want this to be easily
removed<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:05.360> mean<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> battery<00:02:06.730> have<00:02:07.730> many<00:02:08.030> of

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
removed I mean the battery have many of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.910 
removed I mean the battery have many of
these<00:02:08.510> kind<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:09.020> batteries<00:02:09.650> from<00:02:09.920> different

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
these kind of batteries from different

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.100 
these kind of batteries from different
small<00:02:12.920> cameras<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.320> players<00:02:15.320> etc<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.110> that's

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
small cameras and players etc and that's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.810 
small cameras and players etc and that's
why<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.440> attach<00:02:19.130> jst<00:02:20.260> connector<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:22.670> they

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
why I attach jst connector because they

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.060 
why I attach jst connector because they
want<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.180> do<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.630> easily<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.130> field<00:02:27.070> so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
want to do that easily in the field so

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.300 
want to do that easily in the field so
in<00:02:28.970> my<00:02:29.180> opinion<00:02:29.390> these<00:02:30.260> camera<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.070> best

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
in my opinion these camera is the best

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.300 
in my opinion these camera is the best
out<00:02:31.910> there<00:02:32.140> much<00:02:33.140> better<00:02:33.500> than<00:02:33.770> either<00:02:34.010> way

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
out there much better than either way

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.590 
out there much better than either way
because<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.180> socket<00:02:35.690> board<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.770> much<00:02:37.070> smaller

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
because the socket board is much smaller

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.990 
because the socket board is much smaller
than<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:39.340> by<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.400> way<00:02:40.580> I'm<00:02:40.640> going<00:02:40.850> to

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
than the one by the way I'm going to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.100 
than the one by the way I'm going to
compare<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.960> just<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.710> moment
