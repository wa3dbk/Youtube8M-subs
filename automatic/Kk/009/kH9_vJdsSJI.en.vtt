the<00:00:30.150> only<00:00:30.269> thing<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> watch<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.439> if

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the only thing if to watch out for is if

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.100 
the only thing if to watch out for is if
you<00:00:32.070> put<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> little<00:00:32.309> bit<00:00:32.489> too<00:00:32.669> much<00:00:32.850> power<00:00:33.120> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you put a little bit too much power on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.959 
you put a little bit too much power on
some<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.410> those<00:00:34.500> turns<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.160> might<00:00:35.340> lose

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
some of those turns you might lose

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.549 
some of those turns you might lose
control<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:36.719> easily<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.350> make<00:00:37.380> sure

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
control pretty easily so make sure

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.619 
control pretty easily so make sure
you're<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> full

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you're on top of that and you have full

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.000 
you're on top of that and you have full
control<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.079> car<00:00:40.320> when<00:00:40.770> you're<00:00:40.890> going

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
control of your car when you're going

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.260 
control of your car when you're going
through<00:00:41.219> those<00:00:41.340> turns<00:00:41.640> doesn't<00:00:42.149> happen

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
through those turns doesn't happen

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
through those turns doesn't happen
happen<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> find<00:00:44.160> sometimes<00:00:44.430> when

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
happen much but I find sometimes when

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060 
happen much but I find sometimes when
I'm<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.090> through<00:00:45.450> third<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.469> fourth<00:00:46.710> gear<00:00:47.010> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I'm going through third or fourth gear I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.670 
I'm going through third or fourth gear I
think<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> twin<00:00:48.090> turbo<00:00:48.450> kicks<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
think that twin turbo kicks in and it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500 
think that twin turbo kicks in and it
kind<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> gets<00:00:50.430> through<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> ban<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
kind of gets through that ban and you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.900 
kind of gets through that ban and you
might<00:00:51.660> lose<00:00:51.870> control<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.070> watch<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.760> for

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
might lose control so just watch out for

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
might lose control so just watch out for
that<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.239> you're<00:00:54.390> comfortable<00:00:54.809> you'll<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that if you're comfortable you'll be

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
that if you're comfortable you'll be

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
drag tires on this car I've heard

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
drag tires on this car I've heard
they're<00:01:47.820> they<00:01:48.149> work<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.659> well<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they're they work really well from a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
they're they work really well from a
couple<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:50.399> drifters<00:01:51.000> who<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.479> like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
couple of other drifters who are like

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109 
couple of other drifters who are like
really<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.350> good<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> started<00:01:53.670> taking

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
really really good so I started taking

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
really really good so I started taking
their<00:01:54.420> advice<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.560> mean<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.460> seen<00:01:56.700> an

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
their advice and I mean I have seen an

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.780 
their advice and I mean I have seen an
improvement<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.570> has<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> lot<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.640> find<00:01:59.640> that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
improvement it has a lot of I find that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
improvement it has a lot of I find that
you<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.420> bit<00:02:00.570> slower<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you do go a little bit slower with the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
you do go a little bit slower with the
with<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> drag<00:02:02.250> tires<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.090> odd

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
with the drag tires like for some odd

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
with the drag tires like for some odd
reason<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.689> feel<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.170> has<00:02:04.229> more<00:02:04.409> grip<00:02:04.740> but

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
reason I feel like it has more grip but

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789 
reason I feel like it has more grip but
you<00:02:05.670> don't<00:02:06.060> spin<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.960> much<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.409> find<00:02:07.649> with

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
you don't spin out as much I find with

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.580 
you don't spin out as much I find with
the<00:02:08.580> street<00:02:08.879> tires<00:02:09.149> you'll<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.319> turn

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the street tires you'll get in that turn

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
the street tires you'll get in that turn
they'll<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:10.920> getting<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> points<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
they'll be getting a lot of points and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
they'll be getting a lot of points and
then<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:12.840> end<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.230> swing

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
then the back end will swing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
then the back end will swing
underneath<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.310> you'll<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.610> spin<00:02:14.910> out

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
underneath you and you'll just spin out

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.300 
underneath you and you'll just spin out
with<00:02:15.630> these<00:02:15.780> drag<00:02:16.110> tires<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.650> find<00:02:16.920> them<00:02:17.040> stuck

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
with these drag tires I find them stuck

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.729 
with these drag tires I find them stuck
to<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> road<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.420> slide<00:02:18.739> so

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
to the road and I can just slide so

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.770 
to the road and I can just slide so
that's<00:02:20.400> really<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.030> when<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.360> comes<00:02:21.540> to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
color choice with the car but I thought

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.039 
color choice with the car but I thought
this<00:03:02.010> nice<00:03:02.220> cool<00:03:02.519> blue<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.209> red<00:03:03.239> looks

this nice cool blue with the red looks

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.229 
this nice cool blue with the red looks
pretty<00:03:04.290> good<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.910> added<00:03:05.910> my<00:03:06.060> own<00:03:06.090> little

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
pretty good and I added my own little

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.580 
pretty good and I added my own little
touches<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.170> didn't<00:03:07.380> really

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
touches to it because I didn't really

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.190 
touches to it because I didn't really
like<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.430> designs<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.630> Mustang<00:03:10.019> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
like the designs for the Mustang that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.410 
like the designs for the Mustang that
they<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.680> now<00:03:10.709> they<00:03:11.549> were<00:03:11.610> too<00:03:11.880> plain

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
they have right now they were too plain

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.800 
they have right now they were too plain
and<00:03:12.920> they<00:03:13.920> had<00:03:14.099> saline<00:03:14.610> designs<00:03:15.120> which<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.630> mean

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and they had saline designs which I mean

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.509 
and they had saline designs which I mean
I<00:03:15.840> know<00:03:15.959> what<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.319> Saline<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.160> mean<00:03:17.370> if

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
I know what the Saline is but I mean if

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.920 
I know what the Saline is but I mean if
there's<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.760> Saline<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.359> game<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:18.780> I'm

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
there's a Saline in the game which I'm

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.660 
there's a Saline in the game which I'm
pretty<00:03:19.140> sure<00:03:19.350> there's<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:19.890> may<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.250> but

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
pretty sure there's there may not be but

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.990 
pretty sure there's there may not be but

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
I mean I know I know that I have driven

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.810

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
the Saline in Forza 4 and Forza 3 so I

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.449 
the Saline in Forza 4 and Forza 3 so I
don't<00:03:27.150> really<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:28.049> car<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.440> resemble<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
don't really want this car to resemble a

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.150 
don't really want this car to resemble a
saline<00:03:29.819> yes<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.569> do<00:03:30.630> have<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.079> front<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.680> rear

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
saline yes I do have the front and rear

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.550 
saline yes I do have the front and rear
bumper<00:03:32.579> of<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.819> saline<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:34.410> just

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
bumper of a saline but that's just

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.319 
bumper of a saline but that's just
because<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.950> don't<00:03:35.250> know<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.459> don't<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
because I don't know I don't I like the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.120 
because I don't know I don't I like the
look<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.989> but<00:03:37.440> I'm<00:03:37.530> not<00:03:37.590> gonna<00:03:37.769> make<00:03:37.950> my

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
look of it but I'm not gonna make my

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.830 
look of it but I'm not gonna make my
design<00:03:38.489> look<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> swing<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.660> know

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
design look like a swing if you know

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.059 
design look like a swing if you know
what<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.019> mean<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.829> I

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
what I mean so I

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.699 
what I mean so I
if<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.000> guys<00:03:42.150> want<00:03:42.510> cool<00:03:42.840> designs<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:43.500> are

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
if you guys want cool designs there are

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.140 
if you guys want cool designs there are
a<00:03:43.739> pretty<00:03:44.040> good<00:03:44.220> nice<00:03:44.370> ones<00:03:44.609> like<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.850> Saline

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
a pretty good nice ones like the Saline

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.460 
a pretty good nice ones like the Saline
designs<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:45.690> that's<00:03:45.840> pretty<00:03:46.019> much<00:03:46.170> all<00:03:46.319> they

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
designs but that's pretty much all they

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500 
designs but that's pretty much all they
have<00:03:46.709> nothing<00:03:47.280> really<00:03:47.519> else<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.180> you're<00:03:48.359> gonna

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
have nothing really else so you're gonna

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.300 
have nothing really else so you're gonna
have<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.780> try<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.079> come<00:03:49.829> up<00:03:49.859> with<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:50.280> own

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
have to try and come up with your own

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.059 
have to try and come up with your own
design<00:03:50.819> if<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.530> don't<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:52.889> those

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
design if I if you don't like those

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.580 
design if I if you don't like those
right<00:03:53.370> but<00:03:53.970> uh<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.420> got<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.079> design<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:55.530> I

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
right but uh I got this design so I

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.140 
right but uh I got this design so I
thought<00:03:55.739> it'd<00:03:55.829> look<00:03:55.859> pretty<00:03:55.950> good<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.549> this

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
thought it'd look pretty good and this

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.080 
thought it'd look pretty good and this
track<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.810> very<00:03:58.290> very<00:03:58.590> technical<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> mean

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
track is very very technical so I mean

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.640 
track is very very technical so I mean
if<00:04:00.239> you're<00:04:00.359> gonna<00:04:00.450> test<00:04:00.720> up<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.019> car<00:04:01.319> I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
if you're gonna test up this car I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.470 
if you're gonna test up this car I
recommend<00:04:02.310> using<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.639> school<00:04:02.910> circuit<00:04:03.329> this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
recommend using the school circuit this

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.960 
recommend using the school circuit this
one<00:04:03.750> can<00:04:04.380> really<00:04:04.889> really<00:04:05.130> be<00:04:05.340> challenging

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
one can really really be challenging

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.120 
one can really really be challenging
especially<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.660> part<00:04:06.900> right<00:04:07.019> here<00:04:07.130> but

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
especially at this part right here but

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.830 
especially at this part right here but
if<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.549> really<00:04:08.730> nail<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.299> area<00:04:09.690> down

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
if you can really nail this area down

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.050 
if you can really nail this area down
you<00:04:10.170> got<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.380> good<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:11.069> good<00:04:11.310> drift<00:04:11.579> car<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:11.970> it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you got a good a good drift car for it

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.150 
you got a good a good drift car for it
right<00:04:12.209> but<00:04:12.750> uh<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.260> said<00:04:13.530> change<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
right but uh like I said change the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.979 
right but uh like I said change the
gearing<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.269> tracks<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.750> you're<00:04:15.870> gonna

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
gearing to the tracks and you're gonna

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.289 
gearing to the tracks and you're gonna
be<00:04:16.079> drifting<00:04:16.410> on<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:17.280> want<00:04:17.549> anyways
