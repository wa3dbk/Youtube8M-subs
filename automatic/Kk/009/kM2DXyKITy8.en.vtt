00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.809
 sophie brands will soon land a 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.000
 diploma of these apps and pastry chefs 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.450
 for them a new life will begin 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.760
 a 180 degree turn I worked 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.740
 in marketing I did that for ten 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.380
 years old but I still had the passion to 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.510
 the pastry that tickled me by the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.600
 head and here one day I told myself 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.070
 maybe it's time to get started 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.140
 learn about different internet 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.660
 forums is good right away I saw that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.570
 ferrandis and she is the reference in 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 pastry teaching topic on 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.440
 will put himself in review situation for 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.850
 the brioche you will knead it this morning 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.590
 so at 11:30 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.420
 all must be shaped in 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.920
 farm rooms in photo like that one 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.730
 will eat quietly the cures to 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 7:30 am during this training 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.590
 flows over nine months we will have in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.140
 did 5 months of practice at school and 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.910
 then we have 4 months of practice of a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.260
 professional environment the entirety of the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.850
 people who are in training are 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.280
 people who are motivated they have on a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.570
 thoughtful mature project that have weigh well 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 the pros and cons of reconverting 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.909
 to leave their old job of 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.260
 people but there by chance 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.260
 there are no amateurs finally I want 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 say there is no 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.140
 nobody does that dilettante at this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 which is very important is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.600
 to continue this movement there is not to 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.370
 not warm your hands more at the heater 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 hands we risk putting the butter 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.200
 to mergers and so after that sandblasting 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's not so easy 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.500
 does there are secrets in the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.570
 pastry is really very rigorous 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.160
 there is an alchemy of ingredients that has 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.900
 to know to really get to 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.420
 result we want you listen to me everything 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.800
 the world I was impressed by the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.050
 quality of the teaching we were taught 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.610
 given in the school does not just learn 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.840
 to make a product that may be 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.910
 see in store but we learn 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.500
 really to perfect them so at the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.450
 first we do some basic and then we 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.840
 redone we redo until really 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.410
 result is either really good 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.910
 I really appreciate the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.990
 availability of our teachers it's 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.979
 people to whom we can ask all 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.360
 kinds of questions they are always 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.060
 available to answer questions 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.040
 when you feel like it's going to suck you 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.720
 know what it's not even worth 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.720
 continue on to the shots 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.580
 if they look at it because you're going 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.620
 start again I was next to you 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.910
 better and then humanly it's 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.370
 people who are who are very very 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.260
 nice is nice to perform 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.520
 training with them they know how to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.440
 level with adults so we 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.920
 treat like adults what is 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.290
 appreciable 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.270
 there are three centimeters and there is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.730
 only one centimeter you have to really 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.160
 that you do every two centimeters 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.110
 in a sense that has after you to return 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.820
 completely tourney is kept 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.110
 in the same sense but exciting 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.630
 relay between the two lines that you have 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.330
 does it's very physical we're always 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.739
 to carry you heavy loads in 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.390
 more for a woman that's what we 're going 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.890
 to say at the beginning it's a bit risky 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.870
 to be complicated but in fact not 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.940
 everything we get used to very quickly I think 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.530
 that it is much more painful to 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.630
 get up every morning to do a job 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.040
 which is not rather than a 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.959
 job maybe who at some 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.370
 physical constraints but who in 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.540
 exchange you are to us is 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.730
 completely I'm completely 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.200
 blossomed since I got to 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.600
 ferrandi that I make pastry 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.860
 every day what I love and what 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.850
 I discovered in the pastry with 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.000
 this training is that we can 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.550
 really hinault 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.300
 and create a wide range tafer one can 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.090
 Make a lot of things 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.760
 there are a lot of offset techniques 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.150
 assembly that allow to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.280
 enjoy 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.690
 what's really nice is that 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.940
 it is greed above all 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.120
 when we realize a beautiful and especially a 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.410
 very good cake we have fun no 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.190
 only to oneself but also to people 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.190
 with whom we share 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.410
