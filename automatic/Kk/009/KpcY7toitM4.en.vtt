00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.310
 hee hee hee hee hee hee good to all 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.950
 guys and girls welcome to a new 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.690
 penta English video is me and today you 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.360
 I bring a chapter over a bit of 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.980
 story that many of you have asked me to 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.289
 see when I bring it back that when 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.810
 I do more etcetera etcetera and here what 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.120
 you have as before in chapters 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.070
 previous ones I had said I had to do 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.290
 two champions who are associated with the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.100
 league of the legends that were that he and 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.400
 bad fight the limbo al fitr 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.780
 and after these two I still have 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.550
 all some doubts I do not know if it is done 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.860
 others on the one hand and not on the other 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.800
 or do or the two cities and then 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.050
 separate the heroes so you'll see 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.700
 in the future but we're not going to start with 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.410
 these two steps are the characters that 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.920
 they also have a pretty history 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.230
 interesting we started because in a world 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.390
 very far black very old was still in 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.650
 marched that he was a great heroine the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.720
 strongest of an immortal race 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.300
 destined to destroy the afterlife the evil 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.949
 There is where you will be found by 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.600
 ten thousand years that there are fought non-stop 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.430
 for its people brandishing their already by 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.480
 sword forged long before she 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.010
 existed 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.870
 in turn he covered his figure with a 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.850
 enchanted armor the last work 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.979
 teacher of an extinct race of artisans 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.390
 as beautiful as it was ferocious 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.220
 teach her face since war 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.159
 affected in the depths of his spirit 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.229
 and I did not find him worthy in his search 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.850
 of victory more than once tried to 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.140
 soften the effects of the war but 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.909
 many times I had to make the decision 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.210
 to purge those who herself 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.549
 I had condemned 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.860
 so that justice will often be 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 something horrible but like his personality 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.420
 it was like that is forced to take the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.340
 justice to where evil existed makes 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.810
 ten years the war that we found 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 evil was close to reaching the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.210
 victory but right at that moment 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.509
 a rebellion among the enemy ranks 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.399
 commanded by his morgana sister led 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.680
 out therefore the conflict will 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.909
 Revived morgana will be considered to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.909
 from now on a grill of his 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.399
 village and apparently she had won 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.170
 powerful allies that are nothing more than 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.600
 powerful magicians from a place called 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.130
 unknown an unknown place called 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.840
 of a land 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.880
 morgana trade your server to these 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.709
 wizards to a summoner number is from the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.100
 League in exchange for powerful skills 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.200
 that dominating could take both 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.260
 control that and its people and make it 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.450
 kneel before her to save her 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.070
 world that had no other option to do 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.410
 a pact with the league in particular with his 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.239
 leader the high general counselor who already 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.310
 we talk to him we talk about him in 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.660
 previous chapters the pact was the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.700
 next in exchange for a thousand years of 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.600
 ashram service promised to cut 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.470
 all relationship with 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.630
 of the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.970
 with the disappearance of ashram five years ago 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.890
 years that he has new goals in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.780
 they value that they are not more than others that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.420
 find out who or what made disappear 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.340
 ashram defeating his sister grudgingly and 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.010
 finally bring your justice to the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.640
 League of Legends 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.290
 bad faith would be bad faith 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.319
 then 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.790
 exists in a world in perfect there is a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.250
 world that has a perfect harmony 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.260
 where everything is part of only one 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.329
 monolith that is what this is called 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.879
 world is part of all forms part 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.349
 of the monolith and all are the monolith is 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.060
 the essence of all creation and its 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.819
 inhabitants spices and are pieces 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.560
 unique to it is a nice place and 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.620
 Symmetrical even almost no place to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.599
 uncertainty the rocks that live there 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.280
 they live they work they live to work and 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.900
 to fulfill its obligations of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.920
 maintenance up to the limit of their 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.689
 forces 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.920
 functioning as well as a super organism 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.359
 or a beehive there are no leaders there 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.159
 social differences are all part 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.950
 of one and they work so that this one works 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.720
 bad bad faith is always bound to 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.099
 work to its full potential since its 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.290
 work was part of the rest 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.510
 thus serving a role of a creature 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.099
 distinguished and concerned about strengthening the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.139
 vision of the order of its people that of by 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.209
 yes I already had few errors so 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.760
 they always live to perfection so 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.769
 say it one day and without warning a gap 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.480
 dimensional was opened and he was summoned to 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.909
 through the cosmos to the world of a land 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.810
 the transition was painful and terrifying 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.640
 for him 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.040
 in each of its people's rennet and the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.830
 Monolith things that I had always 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.980
 present in him from the day he 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.920
 was born enraged trapped inside this 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.260
 invocation circle and casting his hatred 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.209
 those who had invoked him but 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.489
 this had a renate explanation to the 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.230
 world that with you you know is very 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.360
 close to being consumed by the lack of 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.370
 harmony and chaos without control was very 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.110
 chaotic was a world that needed 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.120
 champions to attract order outside the 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.550
 chaos because of this this creature was invoked 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.320
 to help the invoker is already the 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.540
 magicians who sought this goal to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.950
 fulfill it by looking through another 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.620
 perspective is to say through their 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.600
 own fears and understanding the reason 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.330
 ivory could see that this fact was a 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.160
 it was a laudable respectable goal and 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.550
 precisely the only one in which he could 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.190
 participate for it today is part of 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.840
 the league crushes everything you are looking for 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.520
 break the movement of value towards 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.020
 order and especially focusing on 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.510
 those beings that in which they wield the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.130
 chaotic magic as a weapon unfortunately 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.470
 bad faith has also begun to change 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.789
 with the world universe change already 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.510
 that has been forced to face their 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.920
 deep 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.460
 through a world where the 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.720
 individuality curiosities we started 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.370
 this time for mauve and with the 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.260
 curiosities are very little is fine 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.940
 they did not manage to count too many since they did not 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.710
 I like to focus on curiosities 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.960
 only the aspects since they are very 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.250
 visible that I come out I believe the 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.200
 deeper curiosity those that do not 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.340
 we know for example what bad faith your 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.870
 let's say that your residence is not in the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.250
 league but you meditate about the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.200
 institute of war is not inside 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.960
 of the institute like for example fidel 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.540
 sticks one skill of his that hits 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.130
 the soil of jaén just when the 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.540
 do you leave in the riot logo that is a 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.470
 fist 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.900
 his dance is taken out is a reference to 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.670
 a capoeira dance that you already know is 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.440
 this martial art in which they are put to 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.170
 dancing there they do as if they hit us but 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.330
 if they stick and recently thanks to 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.190
 the magazines is an ally of máó kai 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.930
 so that these two are elemental beings 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.890
 although they have different points 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.290
 about the reason for the existence of the 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.330
 life and they are very different have had 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.130
 discussions with each other but they have 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.180
 become allies for what today in 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.000
 day 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.820
 they are not friends so to speak for the 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.220
 part that despite its history says 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.180
 that does not show the face ever 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.310
 obviously if the sample of several 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.890
 aspects with 'kale without mask I do not know 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.660
 what this change has come to does not put it 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.310
 nowhere its history with morgan 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.230
 so a direct reference to the poem 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.630
 Christian of Miguel and Lucifer in the 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.570
 paradise lost the fight of good against 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.090
 evil is always a clear reference in 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.669
 all history 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.830
 and his original dance was replaced by 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:49.190
 one of will smith and the prince of 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.979
 bel-air is very funny and another thing that 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.330
 tell you two very funny notes is that 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.430
 in a beginning when I started in this 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.050
 game that I had as you know that each 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.050
 The character has some tips, not like he is 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.000
 I put caster I do not know what then 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.669
 had as character notes that 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.770
 it was a tank and on the other hand 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.229
 skills have been dumped up to three 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.520
 sometimes that is to be an idea that the 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.720
 character who initially came not 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.840
 has nothing to do with the one that exists today in 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.780
 day and well that has been a whole chapter 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.150
 short but quite intense and we 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.090
 we see in the next with the cities already 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:26.560
 I'll tell ya what I will see how I will hope 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.560
 that you liked until the next
