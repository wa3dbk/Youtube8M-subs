a<00:01:54.670> really<00:01:54.999> good<00:01:55.270> gun<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.659> use<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.020> short<00:01:56.319> to

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
a really good gun to use in short to

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.649 
a really good gun to use in short to
medium-range<00:01:56.829> engagements<00:01:57.700> this<00:01:58.209> means<00:01:58.479> most

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
medium-range engagements this means most

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.149 
medium-range engagements this means most
of<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.929> time<00:01:59.139> you're<00:01:59.289> going<00:01:59.469> to<00:01:59.560> drop<00:01:59.740> enemies

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
of the time you're going to drop enemies

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.249 
of the time you're going to drop enemies
and<00:02:00.369> four<00:02:00.609> shots<00:02:00.880> which<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.420> relatively<00:02:01.990> quick

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
and four shots which is relatively quick

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.809 
and four shots which is relatively quick
compared<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:02.889> some<00:02:03.039> of<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.219> other<00:02:03.429> assault

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
compared to some of the other assault

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.609 
compared to some of the other assault
rifles<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.359> game<00:02:04.569> now<00:02:05.109> this<00:02:05.229> thing<00:02:05.439> also

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
rifles in the game now this thing also

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.739 
rifles in the game now this thing also
has<00:02:05.950> an<00:02:06.130> 800<00:02:06.609> round<00:02:06.850> per<00:02:07.060> minute<00:02:07.270> rate<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.539> fire

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
has an 800 round per minute rate of fire

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.190 
has an 800 round per minute rate of fire
which<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.530> fifty<00:02:08.979> behind<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> m416<00:02:10.200> 850

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
which is just fifty behind the m416 850

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.900 
which is just fifty behind the m416 850
rounds<00:02:11.500> per<00:02:11.560> minute<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.370> these<00:02:12.520> two<00:02:12.730> weapons

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
rounds per minute so these two weapons

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.970 
rounds per minute so these two weapons
are<00:02:13.270> pretty<00:02:13.540> damn<00:02:13.840> similar<00:02:14.200> same<00:02:14.709> damage

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
are pretty damn similar same damage

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.589 
are pretty damn similar same damage
relatively<00:02:15.670> same<00:02:15.880> rate<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.209> fire<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
relatively same rate of fire and

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.809 
relatively same rate of fire and
reloading<00:02:17.440> times<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.980> about<00:02:18.220> two<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.490> three

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
reloading times of about two to three

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.030 
reloading times of about two to three
seconds<00:02:19.209> each<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.709> good<00:02:20.830> thing<00:02:20.860> about

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
seconds each so the good thing about

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.680 
seconds each so the good thing about
these<00:02:21.310> two<00:02:21.490> weapons<00:02:21.910> performing<00:02:22.420> very

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
these two weapons performing very

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.480 
these two weapons performing very
similar<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.380> one<00:02:23.590> another<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.370> can

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
similar to one another is that you can

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.550 
similar to one another is that you can
very<00:02:24.520> easily<00:02:24.790> adjust<00:02:25.690> between<00:02:25.900> using<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
very easily adjust between using the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.800 
very easily adjust between using the
m416<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.730> round<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.270> criminal<00:02:28.630> faction

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
m416 one round for the criminal faction

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.510 
m416 one round for the criminal faction
and<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.650> next<00:02:29.860> round<00:02:30.040> you're<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.340> cop

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
and the next round you're on the cop

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.740 
and the next round you're on the cop
side<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.060> can<00:02:31.210> pick<00:02:31.330> up<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.570> m16a3<00:02:32.260> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
side you can pick up the m16a3 and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.390 
side you can pick up the m16a3 and
are<00:02:32.840> killing<00:02:33.230> players<00:02:33.410> left<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.920> right<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
are killing players left and right and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.760 
are killing players left and right and
that<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.210> why<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.900> dead<00:02:36.140> tie<00:02:36.320> between

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
that is why I have a dead tie between

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.170 
that is why I have a dead tie between
these<00:02:36.920> two<00:02:37.130> weapons<00:02:37.340> when<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.790> comes<00:02:37.940> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
these two weapons when it comes to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.510 
these two weapons when it comes to
performance<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.990> weapon<00:02:39.710> license<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.250> kind

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
performance the weapon license is kind

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.100 
performance the weapon license is kind
of<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.670> struggle<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.510> since<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.990> need

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
of a struggle to get since you need

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.140 
of a struggle to get since you need
twelve<00:02:42.440> hundred<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.920> fifty<00:02:43.190> kills<00:02:43.460> so<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
twelve hundred and fifty kills so to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.760 
twelve hundred and fifty kills so to
have<00:02:44.360> weapons<00:02:44.630> on<00:02:44.900> both<00:02:45.110> factions<00:02:45.470> that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
have weapons on both factions that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.740 
have weapons on both factions that
perform<00:02:46.250> similarly<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.240> another<00:02:47.510> is

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
perform similarly to one another is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.700 
perform similarly to one another is
pretty<00:02:48.110> awesome

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
pretty awesome

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.770 
pretty awesome
so<00:02:49.310> all<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.730> really<00:02:49.820> comes<00:02:50.120> down<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.360> is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
so all it really comes down to is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.660 
so all it really comes down to is
preference<00:02:51.380> do<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.709> want<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.010> gun<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.490> close

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
preference do you want a gun for close

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.520 
preference do you want a gun for close
quarters<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.240> struggles<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.780> tiny<00:02:54.080> bit<00:02:54.350> at

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
quarters that struggles a tiny bit at

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.800 
quarters that struggles a tiny bit at
medium<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.190> longer<00:02:55.520> ranges<00:02:56.030> or<00:02:56.270> do<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.510> want<00:02:56.690> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
medium to longer ranges or do you want a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.510 
medium to longer ranges or do you want a
weapon<00:02:57.020> for<00:02:57.380> close<00:02:57.620> quarters<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.250> will<00:02:58.370> be

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
weapon for close quarters that will be

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.640 
weapon for close quarters that will be
slightly<00:02:58.970> better<00:02:59.360> at<00:02:59.660> medium<00:03:00.050> ranges<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
slightly better at medium ranges and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.830 
slightly better at medium ranges and
still<00:03:00.980> lack<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:01.520> long-range<00:03:02.120> capability

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
still lack in that long-range capability

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.650 
still lack in that long-range capability
now<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.590> me<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.709> would<00:03:03.980> want<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.280> m16a3<00:03:05.060> for

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
now for me I would want the m16a3 for

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.479 
now for me I would want the m16a3 for
the<00:03:05.750> medium<00:03:06.140> range<00:03:06.290> engagements<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:07.220> slower

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
the medium range engagements that slower

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.340 
the medium range engagements that slower
rate<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.790> fire<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.300> going<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.630> help<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.989> out<00:03:09.020> at

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
rate of fire is going to help you out at

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.930 
rate of fire is going to help you out at
being<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.709> bit<00:03:09.980> more<00:03:10.190> accurate<00:03:10.640> at<00:03:10.760> those

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
being a bit more accurate at those

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.970 
being a bit more accurate at those
distances<00:03:11.390> now<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.140> may<00:03:12.230> not<00:03:12.380> seem<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:12.680> much

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
distances now it may not seem like much

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.800 
distances now it may not seem like much
but<00:03:13.040> I've<00:03:13.400> come<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.850> do<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> tiny<00:03:14.420> bit<00:03:14.540> better

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
but I've come to do a tiny bit better

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.770 
but I've come to do a tiny bit better
with<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.170> m16a3<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:17.090> preferred<00:03:17.420> loadout<00:03:17.750> for

with the m16a3 my preferred loadout for

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.770 
with the m16a3 my preferred loadout for
the<00:03:18.170> m16a3<00:03:19.010> would<00:03:19.550> have<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.820> be<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> cobra<00:03:20.570> red

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
the m16a3 would have to be a cobra red

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.930 
the m16a3 would have to be a cobra red
dot<00:03:20.959> sight<00:03:21.260> extended<00:03:21.800> mags<00:03:22.010> heavy<00:03:22.340> barrel<00:03:22.730> and

vertical grip Cobra sight is a million

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.830 
vertical grip Cobra sight is a million
times<00:03:25.489> better<00:03:25.910> than<00:03:26.150> these<00:03:26.300> stock<00:03:26.570> iron

accuracy with the weapon which is what
I'm<00:03:30.530> going<00:03:30.709> for<00:03:31.010> now<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.610> vertical<00:03:31.910> grip<00:03:32.209> also

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
I'm going for now the vertical grip also

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.449 
I'm going for now the vertical grip also

moving<00:03:34.700> which<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.120> tend<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> do<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.720> lot<00:03:36.110> now<00:03:36.860> I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
moving which I tend to do a lot now I

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.039 
moving which I tend to do a lot now I
found<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.430> loadout<00:03:37.730> works<00:03:38.000> best<00:03:38.299> for<00:03:38.480> me<00:03:38.660> but

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
found this loadout works best for me but

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.479 
found this loadout works best for me but
it<00:03:39.140> might<00:03:39.260> not<00:03:39.410> work<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:39.709> everyone<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.250> feel

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
it might not work for everyone so feel

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.390 
it might not work for everyone so feel
free<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.760> experiments<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:43.070> has<00:03:43.220> been<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
free to experiments so this has been the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.590 
free to experiments so this has been the
best<00:03:43.700> assault<00:03:44.150> rifle<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.570> battlefield

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
best assault rifle in battlefield

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
hardline again it's still kind of early

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.759 
hardline again it's still kind of early

now the m16a3 might still be king or it
might<00:03:54.799> not<00:03:54.980> be<00:03:55.220> but<00:03:55.670> right<00:03:55.850> now<00:03:56.000> I'm<00:03:56.150> sticking

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
to my opinion now on the other hand you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.770 
to my opinion now on the other hand you
might<00:03:58.730> think<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.090> completely<00:03:59.570> different

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
might think a completely different

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.960 
might think a completely different
weapon<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.440> better<00:04:00.799> assault<00:04:01.220> rifle<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.700> use

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
weapon is a better assault rifle to use
