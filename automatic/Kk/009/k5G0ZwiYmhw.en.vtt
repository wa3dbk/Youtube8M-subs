examples of what these filters will do

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.990 
examples of what these filters will do
about<00:00:08.639> two<00:00:08.849> filters<00:00:09.330> for<00:00:09.540> my<00:00:09.800> Sony<00:00:11.269> FDR<00:00:12.269> ax<00:00:12.929> 33

52<00:00:23.730> millimeters<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:24.779> goes<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.260> one

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
52 millimeters is what goes on this one

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.630 
52 millimeters is what goes on this one
so<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.369> already

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
so you see that when it's already

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700 
so you see that when it's already
screwed<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.560> keep

screwed on I really just want to keep
dust<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> stuff<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.880> lens<00:00:30.570> which

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
dust and stuff out of the lens which

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.080 
dust and stuff out of the lens which
opens<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.590> there<00:00:31.769> me

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
opens up in there me

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
opens up in there me
I<00:00:33.559> pulled<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I pulled it up now you can see the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.479 
I pulled it up now you can see the
floating<00:00:35.730> lens<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.739> inside<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
floating lens in there inside that and

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
floating lens in there inside that and
we'll<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.610> outside<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> we'll<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.540> how<00:00:42.719> some

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
we'll go outside and we'll see how some

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.380 
we'll go outside and we'll see how some
of<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> looks<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> minute<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.520> also<00:00:45.059> got

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
of this looks in a minute I also got

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
of this looks in a minute I also got
this<00:00:45.570> circular<00:00:46.200> polarizer<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.370> can

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this circular polarizer which you can

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.090 
this circular polarizer which you can
see<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.760> cold<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.329> bits<00:00:48.480> dark

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
see it's cold a little bits dark

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.799 
see it's cold a little bits dark
enhances<00:00:50.100> contrast<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.030> color<00:00:51.239> saturation

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
enhances contrast and color saturation

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
enhances contrast and color saturation
reduces<00:00:52.739> reflections<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.239> we're<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.449> go

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
reduces reflections so we're gonna go

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
reduces reflections so we're gonna go
out<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> porch<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> shoot

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
out on the porch here and kind of shoot

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
out on the porch here and kind of shoot
back<00:00:56.370> towards<00:00:56.699> some<00:00:56.850> Sun<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.120> things<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
back towards some Sun and things and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740 
back towards some Sun and things and
look<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.370> various<00:00:59.820> outside<00:01:00.210> shots<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
look it's just various outside shots and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.560 
look it's just various outside shots and
see<00:01:00.899> how<00:01:01.109> these<00:01:01.910> filters<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.120> effect<00:01:03.449> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
see how these filters do effect I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
see how these filters do effect I
imagine<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.170> doesn't<00:01:04.439> affect<00:01:04.680> color

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
imagine this one doesn't affect color

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.240 
imagine this one doesn't affect color
maybe<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> does<00:01:05.640> help<00:01:06.600> zoom<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.860> wishes

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
maybe it does help zoom and wishes

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
maybe it does help zoom and wishes
improves<00:01:08.729> image<00:01:09.180> clarity<00:01:09.479> let's<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.470> if

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
improves image clarity let's see if

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740 
improves image clarity let's see if
that's<00:01:10.770> true<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> basically<00:01:12.540> bought

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that's true this one I basically bought

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
that's true this one I basically bought
just<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.110> protection<00:01:13.740> though<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.070> one

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just for protection though this one

like<00:01:48.420> reflections<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:51.119> know<00:01:51.240> gonna

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
like reflections or is it you know gonna

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
like reflections or is it you know gonna
cause<00:01:51.930> lens<00:01:52.259> flares<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.740> anything<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.700> one

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
has the filter on right now so I'll do

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.450 
has the filter on right now so I'll do
this<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.119> three<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.950> looking<00:01:59.219> kind<00:01:59.430> of

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
back that way and Sun is back this way I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.539 
back that way and Sun is back this way I
want<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> shoot<00:02:03.240> into<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> Sun<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.460> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
want to shoot into the Sun but just a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.450 
want to shoot into the Sun but just a
little<00:02:05.759> bit<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> test<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.899> colors<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.560> stuff

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.220 

what's<00:02:12.460> really<00:02:12.730> clear<00:02:13.090> zoom<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.140> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
what's really clear zoom in on that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.880 
what's really clear zoom in on that
little<00:02:14.380> poppy<00:02:18.540> zoom<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> cat

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.610 

these<00:02:23.890> are<00:02:24.040> pansies<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.580> think<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:26.050> here<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.320> may

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
these are pansies I think so here I may

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.370 
these are pansies I think so here I may
have<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.860> maybe<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.130> two<00:02:27.430> minutes<00:02:27.700> later<00:02:27.940> with

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
with the fielder removed this is just

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.080 
with the fielder removed this is just
the<00:02:32.620> barrel<00:02:32.980> ends<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.680> again<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.460> cat<00:02:36.700> he's

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
rotating the fact that zoom it seemed

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.540 
rotating the fact that zoom it seemed
like<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.930> rotated<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.770> bit<00:04:29.949> to<00:04:32.160> know<00:04:33.160> if<00:04:33.430> it

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
like that rotated a bit to know if it

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.960 
like that rotated a bit to know if it
does<00:04:33.669> anything<00:04:34.030> at<00:04:34.330> all

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
again down toward the valley how does it

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.500 
again down toward the valley how does it
