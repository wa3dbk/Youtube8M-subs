this<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.500> threading<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this has to do with threading the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
this has to do with threading the
machine<00:00:36.200> okay<00:00:38.840> what<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.440> is

machine okay what you want this one is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.869 
machine okay what you want this one is
already<00:00:40.680> threaded<00:00:41.100> by<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> way<00:00:41.610> I've<00:00:41.820> been

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
already threaded by the way I've been

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
already threaded by the way I've been
using<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.450> because<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> has<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> higher<00:00:43.500> foot

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
using this because it has a higher foot

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
using this because it has a higher foot
lift<00:00:44.370> over<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> material<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.110> have

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
lift over here for the material I have

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
lift over here for the material I have
been<00:00:46.320> doing<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> thread<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
been doing but the way to thread it is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.610 
been doing but the way to thread it is
this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.440> number<00:00:49.620> 92<00:00:50.399> black<00:00:51.270> polyester<00:00:51.960> thread

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this is number 92 black polyester thread

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.060 
this is number 92 black polyester thread
it<00:00:53.579> goes<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.090> underneath<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.980> through<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
it goes in underneath here through the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.889 
it goes in underneath here through the
bottom<00:00:56.870> then<00:00:57.870> swings<00:00:58.289> around<00:00:58.579> comes<00:00:59.579> in

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
bottom then swings around comes in

bottom then swings around comes in
through<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> top<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.760> goes

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
through here through the top now it goes

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.179 
through here through the top now it goes
down<00:01:03.559> into<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.369> part<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.570> goes<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.560> up

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
down into this part here it goes down up

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.320 
down into this part here it goes down up
the<00:01:08.520> middle<00:01:08.610> hole<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:11.270> now<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the middle hole down that one now you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.910 
the middle hole down that one now you
want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.659> swing<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.590> thread

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
want to swing it around the thread

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
want to swing it around the thread
tensioner<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> pull<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.080> hold<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
tensioner right here and pull it hold it

pull<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> thread<00:01:24.720> locks<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
pull it so the thread locks into this

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
pull it so the thread locks into this
that's<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> tensioning<00:01:27.479> device<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.170> it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that's the tensioning device and it's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
that's the tensioning device and it's
very<00:01:28.560> important<00:01:29.220> you'll<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> tons<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
very important you'll have tons of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
very important you'll have tons of
problem<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.229> tension<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> doesn't<00:01:32.250> go

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
problem with tension if that doesn't go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
problem with tension if that doesn't go
right<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> thread

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
right now you will have the thread

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
right now you will have the thread
coming<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.130> over<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.840> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.259> it
