00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.830 
something now there's a difference
between<00:03:40.340> consciously<00:03:41.150> learning<00:03:41.570> something

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
between consciously learning something

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.780 
between consciously learning something
and<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.739> being<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:43.190> little<00:03:43.310> bit<00:03:43.459> awkward

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
and it being a little bit awkward

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150 
and it being a little bit awkward
because<00:03:44.209> you're<00:03:44.570> learning<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.260> forcing

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
because you're learning it and forcing

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.360 
because you're learning it and forcing
yourself<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.850> do<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.000> at<00:03:47.269> all<00:03:47.299> times<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:49.040> want

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
yourself to do it at all times so I want

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.789 
yourself to do it at all times so I want
to<00:03:49.600> allow<00:03:50.600> for<00:03:50.630> when<00:03:51.230> someone's<00:03:51.620> learning

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799

something<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:53.030> yes<00:03:53.329> they<00:03:54.079> may<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.470> to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
something that yes they may have to

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.860 
something that yes they may have to
think<00:03:55.250> about<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.820> they<00:03:56.000> may<00:03:56.120> have<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.420> say<00:03:56.630> I

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
think about it they may have to say I

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.720 
think about it they may have to say I
have<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.170> put<00:03:57.530> my<00:03:57.799> heels<00:03:58.100> down

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
have to put my heels down

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.360 
have to put my heels down
or<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.180> have<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.450> allow<00:03:59.959> my<00:04:00.260> heels<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.769> flex<00:04:01.070> more

and<00:04:02.090> what<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.329> want<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.840> for<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.640> just<00:04:04.880> think

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
and what I want is for you to just think

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360 
and what I want is for you to just think
of<00:04:05.480> allowing<00:04:06.049> these<00:04:06.470> things<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.920> happen<00:04:07.070> all

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
of allowing these things to happen all

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.960

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
the time not making them happen and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.509 
the time not making them happen and
allowing<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.120> muscles<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.750> will<00:04:11.989> be<00:04:12.980> there

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
allowing the muscles that will be there

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.270 
allowing the muscles that will be there
to<00:04:14.120> control<00:04:14.720> where<00:04:15.230> your<00:04:15.410> body<00:04:15.620> needs<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.040> be

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
to control where your body needs to be

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.240 
to control where your body needs to be
as<00:04:16.489> they<00:04:17.479> become<00:04:17.840> stronger<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.890> more<00:04:19.100> you

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
as they become stronger so the more you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.640 
as they become stronger so the more you
practice<00:04:19.489> something<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.750> more<00:04:21.049> your<00:04:21.410> muscles

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
practice something the more your muscles

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.920 
practice something the more your muscles
will<00:04:22.130> accommodate<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:23.180> position<00:04:23.750> you're

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
will accommodate that position you're

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.960 
will accommodate that position you're
trying<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.410> achieve<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.100> if<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.340> stand<00:04:25.669> here<00:04:25.820> and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
trying to achieve so if I stand here and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.550 
trying to achieve so if I stand here and
I'm<00:04:26.180> very<00:04:26.390> relaxed<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.169> see<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.500> very

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
I'm very relaxed and you see it is very

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.219 
I'm very relaxed and you see it is very
easy<00:04:27.800> for<00:04:28.040> me<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.430> balance<00:04:28.610> Here<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.229> am

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
easy for me to balance Here I am

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.800
