00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 enough modena logo 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.520
 let us take as an example the production technique of a thing 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.889
 roll out the modena pasta - a thickness of 4 5 mm 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519
 for a very simple rose prepare the 10 disks 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.260
 place them on a transparent sheet and cover with the same sheet 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.789
 flatten with the thumb I have a ball three quarters of the edge to recreate how much 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.150
 more possible the effect of a real rose petal 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.260
 take the first party lots roll it up for the summer 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 insert second disk into the plague of the first petal and rolled so as to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.450
 create the heart of the rose 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.130
 create with three disks the first round of hey petals to bend outwards 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 place the last five petals 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.320
 bend the ends to get the effect of a blossoming rose 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.000
 once the rose is made and the superfluous sugar is removed at its base 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 small lateral adjustments will allow to obtain a valuable one 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.960
 natural effect 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.350
 another flower very easy to make and the cove 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.159
 spread the pasta mode up to a thickness of 4 5 millimeters 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.640
 some diskettes place them on a transparent sheet and cover them with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.580
 same sheet flatten with the thumb I have a ball three quarters of the board for 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.130
 recreate as much as possible the effect of calabria calyx 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 add the white cup relative to it 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.810
 after having colored the soft dough with the new yellow food color 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.220
 with the help of the palm of the hand form a cone inserted in the center of the chest 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.750
 and close it gently 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.700
 for leaves it is suggested to use a stencil 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 which makes our work faster perfect 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.430
 the use of other molds 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.379
 allows the production of flowers of different shapes 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.379
 in this case we make an orchid 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.309
 we prepare the pistil and insert it over time 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.109
 let us inform the outer petals of the orchid 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.569
 insert the center the main petal 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.569
 and color with the airbrush 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.759
 the coloring will make the decoration even more refined 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.759
 it will create an excellent chromatic effect and view 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.189
 let's go see another decoration 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.189
 roll out the dough so the pine is 3 4 thick 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.819
 maybe a lace a pizza hut to crush that to remove the lace 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.869
 it will then be sufficient to cut the dough along the edges with a knife 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:04.029
 sharp tool 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:08.189
 and enrich the decoration with a rounding of the edges obtained with a 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.649
 simple stencil 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.220
 the band thus obtained 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.130
 is placed at the base of the cake 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.130
 to which it adheres without difficulty 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.319
 as much as the highest polystyrene cylinder to be covered requires one 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.339
 cover pasta more rigid than cooked pasta 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.630
 this is a function performed in an optimal manner by the Modena coast 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.289
 who represents a more rigid and more consistent dough 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.709
 such that it can easily be used even on height cylinders 

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:45.709
 of 25 30 centimeters 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.080
 with the same Modena pasta 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.280
 other splendid decorative forms can be obtained such as strip strips 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.319
 floppy disks 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.259
 and other geometric figures that the imagination of the pastry chef will know 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.719
 certainly develop
