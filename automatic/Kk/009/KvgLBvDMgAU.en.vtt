this episode off with a squad report and
just<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.120> look<00:00:09.690> at<00:00:09.840> some<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> players<00:00:10.380> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
just a look at some of the players I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.440 
just a look at some of the players I
think<00:00:10.650> Karl<00:00:11.070> gray<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> defender

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
think Karl gray here at the defender

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.509 
think Karl gray here at the defender
he's<00:00:13.080> really<00:00:13.410> good<00:00:13.740> at<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.920> moment<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.340> he's

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
he's really good at the moment like he's

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.670 
he's really good at the moment like he's
only<00:00:14.639> 23<00:00:14.969> years<00:00:15.120> old<00:00:15.420> Lee<00:00:15.599> 70<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> rated<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.560> if

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
only 23 years old Lee 70 I rated but if

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.800 
only 23 years old Lee 70 I rated but if
you<00:00:16.770> look<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.190> his<00:00:17.640> jumping<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.359> standing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you look at like his jumping is standing

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.210 
you look at like his jumping is standing
tackle<00:00:18.990> his<00:00:19.320> interceptions<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.010> he's<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
tackle his interceptions like he's a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.010 
tackle his interceptions like he's a
really<00:00:20.670> really<00:00:20.699> good<00:00:21.000> defender<00:00:21.420> he's<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.810> good

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
really really good defender he's as good

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.679 
really really good defender he's as good
now<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.380> say<00:00:23.340> Caulker<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.000> at<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> start<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
now as say Caulker is at the start of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.269 
now as say Caulker is at the start of
the<00:00:24.840> game<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:25.800> he<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.130> keep

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the game and I think if he can keep

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.740 
the game and I think if he can keep
progressing<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.119> he<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.449> get<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
progressing like that he can get to a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
progressing like that he can get to a
rating<00:00:28.199> similar<00:00:28.949> enough<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> caucus<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
rating similar enough to caucus and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
rating similar enough to caucus and
that's<00:00:30.119> pretty<00:00:30.269> cool<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> I've<00:00:31.260> been<00:00:31.410> meaning

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that's pretty cool and I've been meaning

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.810 
that's pretty cool and I've been meaning
to<00:00:31.740> ask<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.920> guys<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.369> while<00:00:32.550> actually

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
say Tom Bennett for example that right

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870 
say Tom Bennett for example that right
winger<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:03.989> him<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.250 
winger I got him in and for three and a
half<00:01:05.909> million<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.810> he's<00:01:07.110> got

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
half million because I think he's got

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.960 
half million because I think he's got
good<00:01:07.439> potential<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> haven't<00:01:08.729> really

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
good potential but I haven't really

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
good potential but I haven't really
found<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> opportunity<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.200> use<00:01:10.409> him<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.710> lot

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
found the opportunity to use him a lot

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.230 
found the opportunity to use him a lot
and<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.100> feel<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.490> bad<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.030> because

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and I feel pretty bad about that because

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.640 
and I feel pretty bad about that because
he's<00:01:12.479> always<00:01:12.570> moaning<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.500> getting

how<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.579> think<00:03:07.879> it's<00:03:08.030> gonna<00:03:08.180> pan<00:03:08.419> out<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.870> in

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
how I think it's gonna pan out but in

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.929

him<00:03:59.870> from<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.169> Brazilian<00:04:00.590> team<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:00.919> think<00:04:00.949> and<00:04:01.250> he

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
him from a Brazilian team I think and he

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.770 
him from a Brazilian team I think and he
looks<00:04:01.489> really<00:04:01.729> good<00:04:01.849> but<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.449> the<00:04:02.540> final

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
looks really good but in the final

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.899 
looks really good but in the final
minute<00:04:03.199> of<00:04:03.259> the<00:04:03.319> game<00:04:03.409> Jacob<00:04:04.370> Murphy<00:04:04.699> comes

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
minute of the game Jacob Murphy comes

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.670 
minute of the game Jacob Murphy comes
forward<00:04:05.180> he<00:04:05.359> gets<00:04:05.629> round<00:04:05.930> MacNeil<00:04:06.349> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
forward he gets round MacNeil and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.189 
forward he gets round MacNeil and
manages<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.549> finish<00:04:07.909> really<00:04:08.329> tightly<00:04:08.689> into

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
manages to finish really tightly into

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.140 
manages to finish really tightly into
the<00:04:09.289> net<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.620> he<00:04:10.250> couldn't<00:04:10.699> help<00:04:10.879> but<00:04:11.000> not

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the net and he couldn't help but not

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.969 
the net and he couldn't help but not
celebrate<00:04:11.689> at<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.959> moment<00:04:12.169> I<00:04:12.560> think<00:04:12.769> it's

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
celebrate at this moment I think it's

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.830 
celebrate at this moment I think it's
one<00:04:13.129> of<00:04:13.159> those<00:04:13.280> adrenaline<00:04:13.849> type<00:04:14.030> things<00:04:14.299> but

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
one of those adrenaline type things but

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.420 
one of those adrenaline type things but
he<00:04:15.139> still<00:04:15.349> kept<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.680> celebrations<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.400> a

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
he still kept the celebrations to a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.770 
he still kept the celebrations to a
respectable<00:04:16.940> level<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.449> that's<00:04:17.570> what

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
respectable level and that's what

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.629 
respectable level and that's what
matters<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.229> we<00:04:18.349> ended<00:04:18.469> up<00:04:18.680> escaping<00:04:19.400> from

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
matters but we ended up escaping from

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.519 
matters but we ended up escaping from
that<00:04:19.789> game<00:04:19.969> with<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.449> 3-2<00:04:20.690> victory<00:04:20.959> after<00:04:21.260> what

that game with a 3-2 victory after what
was<00:04:21.650> almost<00:04:21.979> like<00:04:22.279> a<00:04:22.550> real<00:04:22.880> slip<00:04:23.270> up<00:04:23.449> for<00:04:23.690> us

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810

stages they've got to victory so far and
I<00:04:36.900> went<00:04:37.590> into<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:37.949> game<00:04:38.160> thinking<00:04:38.360> I'd<00:04:39.360> like

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
I went into this game thinking I'd like

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.930 
I went into this game thinking I'd like
to<00:04:40.050> draw<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.500> because<00:04:40.919> I'd<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.310> for<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.639> Dundee

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
to draw it because I'd like for a Dundee

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.070 
to draw it because I'd like for a Dundee
United<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.330> get<00:04:42.419> out<00:04:42.510> with<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:42.720> group<00:04:42.870> I

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
United to get out with this group I

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.240 
United to get out with this group I
think<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.350> would<00:04:43.440> be<00:04:43.500> great<00:04:43.650> for<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.949> Scottish

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
think it would be great for a Scottish

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.250 
think it would be great for a Scottish
football<00:04:44.639> but<00:04:44.850> at<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> same<00:04:45.210> time<00:04:45.419> I'm<00:04:45.870> gonna

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
football but at the same time I'm gonna

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.480 
football but at the same time I'm gonna
win<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.650> if<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.860> opportunity<00:04:47.370> presents

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
win it if the opportunity presents

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.040 
win it if the opportunity presents
itself<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:48.120> know<00:04:48.180> that's<00:04:48.479> how<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:48.600> god<00:04:48.870> that's

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
itself you know that's how I god that's

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.510 
itself you know that's how I god that's
how<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.199> kept<00:04:49.470> thinking<00:04:49.590> about<00:04:49.949> it<00:04:50.100> in<00:04:50.190> my<00:04:50.310> head

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
how I kept thinking about it in my head

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.370 
how I kept thinking about it in my head
and<00:04:50.669> our<00:04:51.210> team<00:04:51.419> was<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.600> pretty<00:04:51.840> weakened<00:04:52.260> when

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
and our team was a pretty weakened when

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.500 
and our team was a pretty weakened when
I<00:04:52.440> played<00:04:52.740> Caleb<00:04:53.190> Rainsford<00:04:53.760> at<00:04:54.060> left-back

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
I played Caleb Rainsford at left-back

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.150 
I played Caleb Rainsford at left-back
the<00:04:54.780> irish<00:04:55.110> central<00:04:55.440> defensive<00:04:55.770> midfielder

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
the irish central defensive midfielder

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.530 
the irish central defensive midfielder
he<00:04:56.280> can<00:04:56.400> actually<00:04:56.550> play<00:04:56.820> left<00:04:57.060> back<00:04:57.240> for<00:04:57.419> some

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
he can actually play left back for some

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.000 
he can actually play left back for some
reason<00:04:57.810> that's<00:04:57.930> one<00:04:58.050> of<00:04:58.110> his<00:04:58.229> positions<00:04:58.650> he

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
reason that's one of his positions he

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.230 
reason that's one of his positions he
doesn't<00:04:59.190> really<00:04:59.280> have<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.550> stats<00:04:59.760> for<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.120> but

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
doesn't really have the stats for it but

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.460 
doesn't really have the stats for it but
I<00:05:00.270> put<00:05:00.450> him<00:05:00.540> there<00:05:00.570> anyway<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.260> was<00:05:01.350> done

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
I put him there anyway and it was done

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.050 
I put him there anyway and it was done

D&amp;I either by the opening chance of the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.969 
D&amp;I either by the opening chance of the
game<00:05:03.090> forcing<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.139> saved<00:05:04.380> from<00:05:04.530> i<00:05:04.710> think<00:05:04.889> it

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979
