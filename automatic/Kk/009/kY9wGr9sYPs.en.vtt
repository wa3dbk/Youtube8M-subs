00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.990
 marsÃ³ 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello good players we are here in a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.299
 new video tutorial or what better 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.100
 could be called a guide and well let's 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.529
 explain simply to ride a 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.810
 departure in lan since many users 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.300
 they were asking me this way 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.280
 private messages that as I know how it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.289
 Well first they performed that 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.020
 to clarify is that a game in the cndh is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 simply for users who are 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.260
 for people who are sharing your 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.780
 good agreement router there are two ways or 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.979
 users who share router or use 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 hamachi agree that it is simply 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.909
 a network that makes it as if 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.589
 everyone was using the same router 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.949
 in good agreement 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:53.460
 it's very simple , okay, well, 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.019
 I will do first guide guide 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 basic is to say so you can play 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.429
 for example with your brother who is in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.199
 the next room using your 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.380
 same router or with your neighbor the bastard 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.780
 the one that is letting you have 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.780
 and it's going to be very quick very 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.670
 simple the truth is that that record 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.090
 the computers a lot of leagues that we're going to 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.860
 use when I say when I clarify that I am 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.860
 in another computer I'll say it according 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 It's very easy to remember us 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.220
 you just have to go to minecraft 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.560
 you go to your to your minecraft the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.149
 run and you go to a player and create a 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 new world does not matter the name that 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.420
 you put 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.050
 as if you want to put a map that already 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.610
 you have on board 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.000
 well, we wait for the generation of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.000
 terrain is 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 OK 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.820
 well we are already in our game of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.820
 good agreement 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.380
 so how do you want your 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.689
 brother your friend who is the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.220
 room next door and is connected to 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.869
 your clear router that wants wants 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.649
 enter the server you want to make 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.250
 between the good click escape you go to 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.989
 open to land and start a world 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.280
 from the beginning of a world of work to 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.360
 translation is very well done but 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.670
 good 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.160
 Well, as you can see, you already have 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.750
 the open side of agreement now only 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.870
 is that your friend starts in class 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.890
 in agreement 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.890
 Well, let's go 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.260
 let's do like the one we 're going to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.849
 our friend's computer good already 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.459
 we are on our friend's computer 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.239
 ok okay you should go to your minecraft 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.520
 but let's go to a player we are not going to 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.099
 multiplayer one truth is that because 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.510
 is looking for the worlds in and like 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.140
 you will see the world will come out of that side 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.849
 age with the lic 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.430
 and the name of the map well 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.599
 you simply enter and you can play 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.599
 with your friend 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.940
 As you can see, I'm upstairs, you bastard 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.940
 and good 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.769
 it is simply remembered 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.830
 well up here no longer there is no 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.360
 no complication is just that rule 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.370
 that you can only play with people who 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.940
 are connected to the web to ourselves 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.840
 router and well I've done this 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.660
 let's go back to our main computer 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.720
 and well we try to create it from 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.040
 the machi agreed well this time no longer 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.380
 I will be able to explain what they have to 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:49.430

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.440

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.680
 simply to breeze to machida chorus 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.310
 well I have a pretty version 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.320
 old machine that you can 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.990
 download any of the 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.230
 later and well you simply must 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.570
 put a name and good to do create a 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.250
 nyon network of good agreement create a 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.860
 you simply look for the option to create 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.780
 a good new network they put the name 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.580

 and that fat guy comes in 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.460
 It is not necessary because I am the owner 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.180
 of this network 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.180

 believe the computer that you are in the 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.780
