00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.429
 ladies and gentlemen here we are 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.549
 that mass really looks like a sheet 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.949
 spectacular white well the machada well 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.949
 sobada well stretched cooked 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.460
 well fine fine fine as well as it's in 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.210
 this size for being a little bit more 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.410
 we put it in boiling water 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.740
 salted well abundant like the one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.309
 we have here inside now we pass it to 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.110
 iborra cold water here we have the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.329
 current games that fishing fishing 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 highlights inside we are half cooked 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 truth very little choice is boiled a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 minute and there if it is fishing, it is put 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.559
 cold water being then once 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 He picks it up from the water and he's going to extend it 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.800
 surviving good a clean rag 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.800
 and well the filling 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.540
 we play then rolling our 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.090
 our most and almost totally 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.460
 keep aha on the hillside, keep it with the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.400
 these separators paper slip end 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.310
 but we simply do this and already 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.920
 We have our cannelloni quoted ready for 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.650
 arm what is truly our 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:30.229
 lists or container to go to the oven 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.229
 let's put abundant 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 perfumed with rosemary underneath me 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 it seems it has been data and it is very good after 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.160
 so much before cutting the panchers 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.400
 both countries great roll have cut me 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.220
 well and notice that they are planted on the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.790
 tomatoes stick in there the best thing 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.790
 I think they get directly natural 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.310
 is what we have to keep the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.340
 temperature that does not break the oven 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.229
 this would need a little more salt 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.789
 maybe send it to the oven now it can be 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.970
 that seems to put a little bit of cheese and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.410
 we send it to the oven apodaca of lack the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.580
 quesito look there give us criminals 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.580
