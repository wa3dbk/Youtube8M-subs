00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello here we present how to activate 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.120
 attendees on the new iPhone 5 with May 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.510
 6 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.190
 good we will begin 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.190
 As you can see it is the iPhone 5 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.190
 we give adjustments 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 general seems simple 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.630
 32 gb 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.560
 you go to accessibility 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.890
 Auditions 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.880
 here it is 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.880
 assistants and activate 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 good and will offer us this we can 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.180
 move here here or wherever we want 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.540
 to the point 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.840
 how does this work as you see this in the year 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.080
 6 has improved and on the iphone 5 of 5 13 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.350
 I also suppose here for example here 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.350
 dais 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.590
 hello serves 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.479
 and such and you can talk council 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.869
 by 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 another functionality is if we give twice 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.310
 here it opens yes 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.480
 something else is device we can turn 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.390
 the screen mute block the 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.370
 screen upload volume like here I'm going to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.330
 lower the volume is more shake 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.360
 multitasking that is the same thing that I have done 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.360
 I 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 let's keep going 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.010
 and screenshot that we no longer have 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.000
 what to do here and eat 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.000
 we give here 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.500
 go to the screenshot 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.319
 what more to buy favorites to have 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.150
 italic gestures 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.610
 let's do this 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.870
 I've never done it because the truth is that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.239
 I do not need it and I do not recommend it 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.730
 because it's nonsense to be with two fingers and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.489
 Needless 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.489
 also for example you also open 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.280
 if we give here it's to go back 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.770
 I am volume is to activate the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.350
 vertical screen plays a left 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.070
 now you can not turn but good 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.070
 a screen 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.830
 good 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.620
 and that's it and it's nothing and for 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.780
 disable it same vice but that remove 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.770
 the gesture itself 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.530
 there are touch and greens we activate today 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.230
