00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.610
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.870
 to a new videos of minecraft mod and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.029
 Today I bring you a way that appeared to me 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.310
 very very curious because it is like a 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.980
 accused before the magical chrome but that 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.690
 much simpler is called word plans 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.890
 and now it teaches us how it works 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.560
 and I'm going to put the seed because 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.240
 is seeing that in the background there is a city 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.939
 and right there goes out here I'm not going to any 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.860
 site so if you go in and want a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.660
 seed that has a village by 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.760
 side look if you have villagers pay for 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.769
 sacks and good that this stretch after 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.680
 just like the magical cross what we 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.510
 allows is to put ourense plantations 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.360
 to say because diamond planting and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.250
 iron gold those things but this is a lot 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.809
 simpler because the magical crop 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.909
 have two problems one that you have to 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.530
 do many things that if you chop essences 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.589
 that if you convert them, that is to say, 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.089
 in many moves that well that's not a 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.830
 inconvenient but whatever a 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.119
 disadvantage is that it has very little 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.650
 compatibility with another mode and without 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.699
 However, this one sanctioned with practically 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.130
 anything goes 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.890
 these are the seeds we have the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.470
 coal 10 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.850
 gold rest in emeralds the pencil and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 here put diamonds so you can see 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.690
 how it is done that can be done like that with 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.270
 the seeds around and the block in 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.619
 medium or you can also make this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.490
 good since it is not to do is to get 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.619
 make it more complicated than it is 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.420
 cutting grass cutting you can 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.280
 get out of any kind but it's very 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.100
 complicated that does not come out of the normal 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.509
 so the most logical thing is that good 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 that you get normal seeds 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.840
 starting the seedlings and six then 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.549
 with the normals and the block because it is 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.619
 that if not here you can take two 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.049
 months cutting and boiled appointments to take 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.970
 a seed to the best of coal and it's not 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.549
 yours, the truth we are going to put them 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.799
 here we have coal that is not seen 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.250
 is that of iron those of gold that of 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.630
 diamond the emerald the pencil and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.459
 we go around here the remains so that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.260
 be alone can be what is a 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:07.630
 little bit with this with bone dust this one 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.840
 trittin and this grows like pumpkins 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.230
 and the watermelons and others say that it stays 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.760
 well and now tito will go out the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.370
 blocks and look and I pulled out is the one from 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.840
 diamond is worth and what's funny 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.220
 Good thing because if picatoste 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 will come out later later another so 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.310
 let's leave it here that all grow 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.310
 see you 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.499
 Well guys, I'm already some accounts 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.909
 we need to wait for all 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.400
 because here are some that you see that do not 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:43.450
 They want to leave and as you can see, what comes out is 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.150
 mistake for the diamond I get the iron and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.499
 others and nothing because you break it and it will come out 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.700
 another one with it ends it here is 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:57.040
 breaking looks but good to do these 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:59.379
 super fast as the creative and break 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.599
 the pencil and good will grow more and 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.799
 more and more and more and we can go removing 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.689
 more and more as you see once what 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.269
 break I know it's faster usually 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.319
 that when they are growing first 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.549
 time but anyway it's very 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.530
 random because you notice that they have grown 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.599
 for these here and yet the rest 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.489
 has not come out any more and so it's 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.590
 some good go as they please 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.019
 but the things that we will have there come out 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 our short is for the face and good to 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.199
 be a little more entertaining 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.540
 and look for the materials because of course 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.189
 once we have enough 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.699
 blocks to make a lot of crumbs the rest 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.530
 man to do many many crops 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.720
 well then we will not have any 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.200
 no need for 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.610
 to the gap and others that look good is 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.980
 well because it 's part of minecraft but 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.210
 there are times that it tires a little 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.770
 so the boys I hope that I have 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.480
 liked and let's move on to see how it 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.770
 It distracts thewe although good if it will be 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.330
 like everyone else but well let's go there 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.220
 to install this mode you have to 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.860
 do it like the other modes you have 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.420
 than having version 1.7 points 10 of 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.460
 minecraft with the force and chifas 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.810
 installed you will have the description and 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.190
 you will also have the description one 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.720
 list where you will find all the modes 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.190
 and at the end of the all good at the end of 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.900
 everything may not because even when 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.840
 see this video there is another way but the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.740
 list will be in the mold plan clogs you 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.910
 you go there you will have a link to 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.130
 download it and when you download 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.600
 you will have this file this file 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.100
 you have to put in the mold folder 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.540
 your minecraft and to access it 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.280
 the easiest thing I put is the button 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.530
 windows and was at the same time the button 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.510
 of windows you have it on the left the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.300
 keyboard / control and the ballet leaves you 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.530
 button or silks all wants to run 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.810
 you put the part of the afternoon I wanted 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.000
 percentage peratta percentage to accept 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.760
 you enter in point minecraft you enter in 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.530
 mods and then copy it and move it or 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.030
 what you want and once you are 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.250
 then it works directly 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.630
 guys so I do not expect connected much 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.540
 very much if you liked 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.460
 which is more with a bunch of little plants 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.830
 that give us loves and diamonds and everything 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.830
 and see you in the video to another
