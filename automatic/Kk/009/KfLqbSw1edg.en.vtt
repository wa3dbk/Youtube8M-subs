00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
off has always been Picasso when I was a

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.500 
off has always been Picasso when I was a
kid<00:01:31.870> it<00:01:32.470> was<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:33.190> couldn't<00:01:33.970> understand

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
kid it was just I couldn't understand

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.870 
kid it was just I couldn't understand
how<00:01:34.720> he<00:01:34.750> did<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.409> as<00:01:36.010> I<00:01:36.220> got<00:01:36.400> more<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.790> more

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
how he did it and as I got more and more

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.210 
how he did it and as I got more and more
into<00:01:37.180> what<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.360> do<00:01:37.510> he's<00:01:38.470> always<00:01:38.680> kind<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.100> been

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
into what I do he's always kind of been

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.440 
into what I do he's always kind of been
a<00:01:39.280> hero<00:01:39.640> in<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.150> sense<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:43.180> always

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
a hero in the sense that it's always

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.870 
a hero in the sense that it's always
unpredictable<00:01:44.010> he's<00:01:45.010> always<00:01:45.370> reaching<00:01:45.729> out

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
unpredictable he's always reaching out

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.719 
unpredictable he's always reaching out
to<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:47.200> many<00:01:47.260> different<00:01:47.560> ways<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.310> expressing

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
to so many different ways of expressing

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.280 
to so many different ways of expressing
himself<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.600> think

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
himself I think

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.430 
himself I think
any<00:01:50.620> art<00:01:51.250> that's<00:01:52.180> really<00:01:52.720> going<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:52.960> relate<00:01:53.260> to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
any art that's really going to relate to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.050 
any art that's really going to relate to
a<00:01:53.470> lot<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.710> people<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.190> based<00:01:54.430> on<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> really

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
a lot of people is based on a really

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
a lot of people is based on a really
strong<00:01:55.360> foundation<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:56.140> drawing<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:56.860> if<00:01:57.190> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
strong foundation of drawing so if you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.789 
strong foundation of drawing so if you
try<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.740> become<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.760> best<00:02:01.200> draftsman<00:02:02.200> that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
try to become the best draftsman that

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.100 
try to become the best draftsman that
you<00:02:02.920> know<00:02:03.190> in<00:02:03.729> other<00:02:03.820> words<00:02:04.090> you're<00:02:04.630> gonna<00:02:04.810> be

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
you know in other words you're gonna be

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.660 
you know in other words you're gonna be
able<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.409> draw<00:02:05.710> better<00:02:05.920> than<00:02:06.040> anyone<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.520> know

able to draw better than anyone you know

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.640 
able to draw better than anyone you know
then<00:02:07.390> whatever<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:09.869> develop<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.049> terms<00:02:11.379> of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
then whatever you develop in terms of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.740 
then whatever you develop in terms of
you<00:02:12.370> might<00:02:12.549> want<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> call<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.030> style<00:02:13.450> or
