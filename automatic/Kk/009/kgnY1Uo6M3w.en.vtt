hello and welcome back to logic
components<00:00:02.399> today<00:00:03.060> we<00:00:03.419> only<00:00:03.570> have<00:00:03.780> three

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
components today we only have three

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.820 
components today we only have three
things<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.470> cover<00:00:04.650> not<00:00:05.600> and/or<00:00:06.830> you're

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
things to cover not and/or you're

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:23.740 
things to cover not and/or you're
watching<00:00:08.069> episode<00:00:08.160> two<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.700> logic<00:00:09.269> components

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.120 

hello<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.019> welcome<00:00:25.380> back<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.619> logic

hello and welcome back to logic

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
hello and welcome back to logic
components<00:00:26.460> yes<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.630> only<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.900> three<00:00:28.109> gates

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
components yes we only have three gates

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
components yes we only have three gates
to<00:00:28.470> look<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.740> today<00:00:29.010> nothing<00:00:29.640> extremely

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to look at today nothing extremely

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.900 
to look at today nothing extremely
complicated<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.070> order<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.700> facilitate

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
complicated but in order to facilitate

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.479 
complicated but in order to facilitate
this<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:34.290> also<00:00:34.559> gonna<00:00:34.800> share<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this I'm also gonna share with you the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.240 
this I'm also gonna share with you the
concept<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.270> truth<00:00:36.510> table<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.649> remember<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
concept of a truth table now remember in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
concept of a truth table now remember in
the<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.489> episode<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.510> processing

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the first episode I said that processing

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.190 
the first episode I said that processing
basically<00:00:40.950> involves<00:00:41.430> inputs<00:00:42.030> processes<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
basically involves inputs processes and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860 
basically involves inputs processes and
outputs<00:00:43.550> also<00:00:44.550> recall<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.059> logic<00:00:45.629> gates

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
outputs also recall that logic gates

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.500 
outputs also recall that logic gates
only<00:00:46.079> work<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.710> bits<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.280> bits<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:48.090> only<00:00:48.270> be

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
only work with bits and bits can only be

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.380 
only work with bits and bits can only be
0<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.079> 1<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.250> means<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.180> gate

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
0 or 1 what this means is if a gate

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
0 or 1 what this means is if a gate
takes<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.199> input<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> sure

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
takes only one input then we can be sure

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
takes only one input then we can be sure
that<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.539> only<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.899> grand<00:00:55.320> total<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.860> two

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that there are only a grand total of two

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.010 
that there are only a grand total of two
possible<00:00:56.489> inputs<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.360> gate<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.780> take

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
possible inputs that this gate can take

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.869 
possible inputs that this gate can take
obviously<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> gates<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.550> looking<00:00:59.760> at

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
obviously the gates we are looking at

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.849 
obviously the gates we are looking at
right<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> consistent<00:01:01.289> output<00:01:01.440> for

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
right now have a consistent output for

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
right now have a consistent output for
every<00:01:02.190> single<00:01:02.430> input<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.539> express<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.379> an

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
every single input to express this in an

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
every single input to express this in an
easy<00:01:04.769> form<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.610> actually<00:01:05.939> write<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.450> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
easy form we actually write what it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
easy form we actually write what it's
called<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.990> truth<00:01:07.290> table<00:01:07.560> well<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.640> basically

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
called a truth table well it's basically

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.910 
called a truth table well it's basically
just<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> table<00:01:09.570> saying<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.380> input

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
just a table saying that for this input

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
just a table saying that for this input
I'll<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.700> output<00:01:12.210> now<00:01:12.869> instead<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
I'll get this output now instead of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
I'll get this output now instead of
showing<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.740> example<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.820> gonna<00:01:14.939> do

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
showing you an example what I'm gonna do

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
showing you an example what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.479> gonna<00:01:15.780> jump<00:01:16.020> straight<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
is I'm just gonna jump straight in to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
is I'm just gonna jump straight in to
telling<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.759> first<00:01:18.030> gate<00:01:18.330> because

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
telling you about the first gate because

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
telling you about the first gate because
this<00:01:19.320> gate<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.740> dead<00:01:20.130> easy<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.640> understand<00:01:21.090> I'm

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
this gate is dead easy to understand I'm

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
this gate is dead easy to understand I'm
gonna<00:01:21.689> actually<00:01:21.840> take<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> opportunity<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
gonna actually take this opportunity to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640 
gonna actually take this opportunity to
also<00:01:23.460> explain<00:01:24.090> how<00:01:24.330> truth<00:01:24.869> tables<00:01:25.259> work<00:01:25.470> as

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
also explain how truth tables work as

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.679 
also explain how truth tables work as
well<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.460> let<00:01:26.670> us<00:01:26.820> kill<00:01:27.090> two<00:01:27.240> birds<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.600> one

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
well so let us kill two birds with one

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
well so let us kill two birds with one
stone<00:01:27.869> by<00:01:28.439> taking<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> look<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.610> knob

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
stone by taking a look at the knob

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
stone by taking a look at the knob
things<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.590> logic<00:01:31.950> diagram<00:01:32.189> we

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
things now in a logic diagram we

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
things now in a logic diagram we
actually<00:01:33.119> draw<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:33.990> gate<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.680> look

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
actually draw out and not gate to look

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
actually draw out and not gate to look
like<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.360> takes<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.869> input<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
like this it takes one input and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
like this it takes one input and
produces<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:38.159> output<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.570> its<00:01:39.840> name

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
produces one output and as its name

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
produces one output and as its name
implies<00:01:40.170> sight<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.920> simple<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
implies sight really simple it is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
implies sight really simple it is
basically<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.170> inverter<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
basically just an inverter what this

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.490 
basically just an inverter what this
means<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> gets<00:01:45.240> 0<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.810> an<00:01:45.960> input<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
means is if it gets 0 as an input it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.550 
means is if it gets 0 as an input it
produces<00:01:47.100> 1<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> output<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.840> gets<00:01:48.990> 1<00:01:49.380> as

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
produces 1 as the output if it gets 1 as

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.730 
produces 1 as the output if it gets 1 as
the<00:01:49.710> input<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.220> produces<00:01:50.909> 0<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> output<00:01:51.780> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the input it produces 0 as the output so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
the input it produces 0 as the output so
i<00:01:52.770> tremely<00:01:53.220> symbol<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.299> 4<00:01:54.450> input

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
i tremely symbol when you get 4 input

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.899 
i tremely symbol when you get 4 input
you<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> invert<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you just have to invert it and that is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.170 
you just have to invert it and that is
the<00:01:57.119> output<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> truth<00:01:59.909> table

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the output so what is the truth table

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.959 
the output so what is the truth table
look<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.770> now<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.549> thing<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.729> want<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
look like now the first thing we want to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.870 
look like now the first thing we want to
consider<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.540> how<00:02:03.780> many<00:02:03.960> inputs<00:02:04.380> are<00:02:04.560> there

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
consider is how many inputs are there

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
consider is how many inputs are there
well<00:02:05.880> since<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.869> gate<00:02:07.110> itself<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.979> only

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
well since the gate itself actually only

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.020 
well since the gate itself actually only
takes<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.610> input

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
takes one input

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.119 
takes one input
therefore<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.259> only<00:02:10.379> two<00:02:10.709> possible

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
therefore there are only two possible

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.800 
therefore there are only two possible
inputs<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.790> gate<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.090> receive

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
inputs this gate can receive

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.430 
inputs this gate can receive
zero<00:02:13.380> or<00:02:13.739> one<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:15.209> when<00:02:15.630> given<00:02:15.810> zero<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.410> is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
zero or one so when given zero what is

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.949 
zero or one so when given zero what is
the<00:02:16.650> output<00:02:16.819> well<00:02:17.819> it's<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:18.870> an

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
the output well it's one because it's an

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.620 
the output well it's one because it's an
inversion<00:02:19.310> given<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.489> obviously<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.300> output

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
inversion given one obviously the output

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.440 
inversion given one obviously the output
is<00:02:21.810> 0<00:02:22.190> therefore<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.550> truth<00:02:23.760> table<00:02:23.970> looks

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
is 0 therefore the truth table looks

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.770 
is 0 therefore the truth table looks
like<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:26.190> yeah<00:02:26.700> these<00:02:27.239> are<00:02:27.480> basically

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
like this so yeah these are basically

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.680 
like this so yeah these are basically
two<00:02:28.050> extremely<00:02:28.500> simple<00:02:29.160> concepts<00:02:29.640> you're<00:02:30.510> not

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
two extremely simple concepts you're not

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.229 
two extremely simple concepts you're not
gate<00:02:30.959> simply<00:02:31.470> inverts<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.160> input<00:02:32.580> whilst

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
gate simply inverts the input whilst

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.270 
gate simply inverts the input whilst
your<00:02:33.480> truth<00:02:33.660> table<00:02:33.840> simply<00:02:34.349> lists<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:35.040> all

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
your truth table simply lists out all

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.180 
your truth table simply lists out all
the<00:02:35.700> input<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.209> output<00:02:36.450> passed<00:02:37.019> with<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the input and output passed with that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.610 
the input and output passed with that
let<00:02:38.550> us<00:02:38.580> now<00:02:38.819> extend<00:02:39.450> our<00:02:39.599> understanding<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
let us now extend our understanding to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.580 
let us now extend our understanding to
gates<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.160> take<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.580> two<00:02:41.849> inputs<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:43.349> start

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
gates that take in two inputs we start

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.110 
gates that take in two inputs we start
off<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.950> D<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.430> eat

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
off with D and eat

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.170 
off with D and eat
what<00:02:45.780> does<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.170> tell<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.640> fact<00:02:47.910> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
what does and tell you in fact and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.809 
what does and tell you in fact and
simply<00:02:48.989> tells<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.799> input<00:02:50.280> 1<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.580> true

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
simply tells you that if input 1 is true

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.840 
simply tells you that if input 1 is true
and<00:02:51.060> input<00:02:51.900> 2<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.200> true<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.400> output<00:02:53.730> is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
and input 2 is true then the output is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.710 
and input 2 is true then the output is
true<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.500> look<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.739> 0<00:02:56.100> 0<00:02:56.299> since<00:02:57.299> neither<00:02:57.569> of

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
true so we look at 0 0 since neither of

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.870 
true so we look at 0 0 since neither of
them<00:02:57.930> are<00:02:58.049> true<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.799> output<00:02:58.830> cannot<00:02:59.459> possibly

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
them are true the output cannot possibly

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.440 
them are true the output cannot possibly
be<00:03:00.120> true<00:03:00.360> therefore<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.500> output<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:02.069> 0<00:03:02.549> same

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
be true therefore the output is 0 same

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.410 
be true therefore the output is 0 same
for<00:03:03.660> 1<00:03:03.840> 0<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.500> 0<00:03:04.830> 1<00:03:05.150> remember<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.390> need

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
for 1 0 and 0 1 remember that we need

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.890 
for 1 0 and 0 1 remember that we need
both<00:03:07.049> input<00:03:07.500> 1<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.920> 2<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.090> true<00:03:09.330> before<00:03:09.780> we

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
both input 1 and 2 to be true before we

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.210 
both input 1 and 2 to be true before we
could<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.140> true<00:03:10.380> as<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> result<00:03:10.980> and

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
could have true as a result and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.699 
could have true as a result and
therefore<00:03:11.849> for<00:03:12.480> both<00:03:12.690> these<00:03:12.930> entries<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
therefore for both these entries the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.910 
therefore for both these entries the
result<00:03:14.099> is<00:03:14.250> still<00:03:14.640> false<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:16.349> only<00:03:16.560> time<00:03:16.769> we

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
result is still false the only time we

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.340 
result is still false the only time we
can<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.220> an<00:03:17.459> output<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.090> true<00:03:18.359> is<00:03:18.540> when

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
can have an output that is true is when

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.240 
can have an output that is true is when
both<00:03:19.890> input<00:03:20.370> 1<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.730> input<00:03:21.299> 2<00:03:21.750> are<00:03:21.989> true<00:03:22.380> in

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
both input 1 and input 2 are true in

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.789 
both input 1 and input 2 are true in
other<00:03:24.060> words<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.540> only<00:03:24.660> time<00:03:24.989> we<00:03:25.109> can<00:03:25.260> write<00:03:25.470> 1

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
other words the only time we can write 1

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.550 
other words the only time we can write 1
in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.070> output<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.640> at<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.959> last<00:03:28.230> row<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
in the output is at the very last row of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.370 
in the output is at the very last row of
the<00:03:28.769> truth<00:03:29.100> table<00:03:29.359> this<00:03:30.359> in<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.780> nutshell<00:03:30.959> is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the truth table this in a nutshell is

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.620 
the truth table this in a nutshell is
the<00:03:31.440> endings<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:32.850> let's<00:03:33.000> move<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.390> take<00:03:33.600> a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
the endings so let's move on to take a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.330 
the endings so let's move on to take a
look<00:03:33.870> at<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.230> last<00:03:34.440> gate<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.950> day<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
look at the last gate of the day and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.780 
look at the last gate of the day and
that<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:35.940> all<00:03:36.480> deeds<00:03:36.989> now<00:03:37.980> based<00:03:38.489> on<00:03:38.670> what

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
that is the all deeds now based on what

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.370 
that is the all deeds now based on what
you've<00:03:38.940> seen<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.450> end<00:03:39.600> gate<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.350> can

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
you've seen of the end gate you can

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.110 
you've seen of the end gate you can
probably<00:03:40.769> put<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.250> pieces<00:03:41.489> together<00:03:41.760> and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
probably put the pieces together and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.420 
probably put the pieces together and
guess<00:03:42.630> what<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> or<00:03:43.290> gate<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.769> supposed<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.280> do

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
guess what the or gate is supposed to do

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
guess what the or gate is supposed to do
if<00:03:45.019> input<00:03:46.019> 1<00:03:46.560> all<00:03:46.889> input<00:03:47.790> 2<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.150> true<00:03:48.389> then<00:03:49.319> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
if input 1 all input 2 is true then the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.780 
if input 1 all input 2 is true then the
output<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.160> true<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.290> your<00:03:52.380> truth<00:03:52.560> table

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
output is true so in your truth table

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.670 
output is true so in your truth table
well<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:54.389> your<00:03:54.510> zero<00:03:54.900> means<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.319> neither

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
well see your zero means that neither

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.680 
well see your zero means that neither
one<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.010> them<00:03:56.190> are<00:03:56.310> true<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.730> therefore<00:03:57.329> your

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
one of them are true and therefore your

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.170 
one of them are true and therefore your
output<00:03:58.049> has<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.290> be<00:03:58.440> false

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
output has to be false

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.710 
output has to be false
however<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.930> 0<00:04:01.200> 1<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.620> 1<00:04:01.650> 0<00:04:01.910> well<00:04:02.910> one<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.600> them

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
however for 0 1 and 1 0 well one of them

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.900 
however for 0 1 and 1 0 well one of them
are<00:04:03.870> true<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.260> therefore<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.340> output<00:04:05.700> is

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
are true and therefore the output is

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.559 
are true and therefore the output is
true<00:04:06.560> now<00:04:07.560> what<00:04:07.739> about<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:08.040> last<00:04:08.220> one<00:04:08.489> well<00:04:09.389> as

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
true now what about the last one well as

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.920 
true now what about the last one well as
long<00:04:10.170> as<00:04:10.350> one<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.519> inputs<00:04:11.700> are<00:04:12.060> true<00:04:12.239> the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
long as one of the inputs are true the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.530 
long as one of the inputs are true the
output<00:04:13.230> will<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.500> true<00:04:13.910> therefore<00:04:14.910> if<00:04:15.150> both

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
output will be true therefore if both

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.150 
output will be true therefore if both
are<00:04:15.720> true<00:04:15.900> that's<00:04:16.350> even<00:04:16.620> better

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
are true that's even better

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.060 
are true that's even better
the<00:04:17.400> output<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:17.850> definitely<00:04:18.419> true<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.070> they

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the output is definitely true and they

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.920 
the output is definitely true and they
have<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.459> today<00:04:21.030> we're<00:04:21.269> taking<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.570> look<00:04:21.599> at

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
have it today we're taking a look at

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.250 
have it today we're taking a look at
truth<00:04:22.380> tables<00:04:22.770> as<00:04:22.919> well<00:04:23.490> as<00:04:23.700> free<00:04:24.000> games<00:04:24.300> do

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
and the audience everything we've talked

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.200 
and the audience everything we've talked
about<00:04:29.170> today<00:04:29.500> will<00:04:29.980> serve<00:04:30.190> as<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.430> broad

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.600 
about today will serve as the broad
foundation<00:04:31.450> for<00:04:32.200> basically<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.889> rest<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700

series now just to clarify your and gate
any<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.150> our<00:04:37.330> gate<00:04:37.600> that's<00:04:38.230> not<00:04:38.500> necessarily

any of our gate that's not necessarily
mean<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.550> have<00:04:39.760> two<00:04:40.210> inputs<00:04:40.720> they're<00:04:41.410> gonna

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
mean to have two inputs they're gonna

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.040 
mean to have two inputs they're gonna
have<00:04:41.650> more<00:04:41.980> than<00:04:42.130> two<00:04:42.310> inputs<00:04:42.900> obviously<00:04:43.900> they

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
have more than two inputs obviously they

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.990 
have more than two inputs obviously they
cannot<00:04:44.230> have<00:04:44.470> one<00:04:44.800> because<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.760> know<00:04:45.850> a

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
cannot have one because you know a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.300 
cannot have one because you know a
comparison<00:04:46.780> needs<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.139> happen<00:04:47.470> if<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:48.220> have

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
comparison needs to happen if you have

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.760 
comparison needs to happen if you have
more<00:04:48.520> inputs<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.540> same<00:04:49.960> kind<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.410> thinking

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
more inputs the same kind of thinking

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.520 
more inputs the same kind of thinking

process to applies for a NAND gate all
the<00:04:53.980> inputs<00:04:54.310> have<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.610> be<00:04:54.730> true<00:04:55.000> before<00:04:55.330> the

the inputs have to be true before the

the inputs have to be true before the
output<00:04:55.930> is<00:04:56.050> actually<00:04:56.440> true

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
output is actually true

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.580 
output is actually true
whereas<00:04:57.520> for<00:04:57.760> all<00:04:58.030> gates<00:04:58.389> all<00:04:58.720> we<00:04:59.140> need<00:04:59.320> is<00:04:59.530> one

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
whereas for all gates all we need is one

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.040 
whereas for all gates all we need is one
input<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.430> be<00:05:00.520> true<00:05:00.760> for<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.360> outputs<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.930> be

input to be true for the outputs to be
true<00:05:02.260> however<00:05:02.950> many<00:05:03.490> inputs<00:05:04.000> go<00:05:04.330> into<00:05:04.690> each

true however many inputs go into each
date<00:05:05.290> well<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.340> basically<00:05:06.460> wraps<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.000> up<00:05:07.060> for

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
date well that basically wraps it up for
