00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.139
 I spoke with my foot in the abruzzo field 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.090
 here I think you've seen doing 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.360
 here a bit different here 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.990
 even differentiated because many people 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.900
 brings gameplay of menstrual vehicles nÃ© 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.670
 which would be the helicopter tanks and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.490
 I decided to bring some here 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.820
 boats that had enough hype when the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 people saw ias game place in e3 and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 also in games with and you have seen the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.160
 building falling is written pinel skyscraper 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.320
 Heaven is this will never get old much 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
 fun to see it falling I liked it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.110
 enough to play with a boat I found 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.480
 good fun, I've played a good time 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.059
 there with him and for those who do not know yet 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.260
 this boat only appears after the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 Skyscraper skyscraper and the name 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.410
 these boats would be to see 15 to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.379
 Chinese side and pwc to the side of the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 United States and as you said this boat is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.350
 very powerful even at first I thought he 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.900
 It was power because how are you going to see it? 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 I destroyed see not destroy viper 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.979
 destroyed and fv destroy tanks with him I 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 really thought he was op but in the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.710
 truth is not for the tank just need 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.439
 two shots to destroy 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.700
 completely so it 's very weak 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.070
 we can say like this 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 but if you know how to use it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.939
 very strong 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.600
 if you start taking out before the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.200
 tank 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 Can you really kill him and Iefp is? 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.299
 much easier since the shot must come 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 the cannon is not so strong 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.119
 main has a very good splash damage 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.189
 which makes him very good against 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.850
 infantry as you have just 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.250
 Destroy a poison and I remembered it 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.649
 immediately from usas 2 with fred rounds 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.799
 when I started to shoot with 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.259
 infantry because it may not seem like 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.030
 It has many buildings of this meditate 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.120
 distance you are seeing 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.490
 but if you get to you will only see 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.650
 explosion on the ground and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.870
 very amusing one such infantry with 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.920
 This noise is very strong, I already said 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.560
 and he also has the same snack and elton 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.410
 I find it a little difficult for you to hit. 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.780
 Helicopter hit things with it 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.930
 however if you have someone locating it 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.360
 either with pld or something else it 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.420
 Turn like a guided missile you 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.850
 just need to keep the loc and it goes 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.070
 to hit you do not have to follow anything 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.110
 if I do not think they do not see it released 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.630
 Of course I was fast I released well. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.150
 quick with some points only this one 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.180
 snack and I also saw other equipment 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.700
 which would be the passive radar that would be 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.280
 as if it were a mission garnde 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.160
 even in the case it would be like a hit 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.290
 even because he crazy air vehicles 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.200
 and you just have to keep it soon you do not 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.170
 You need skin or anything you plotting 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.200
 just need to keep the loc and case for some 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.110
 cause you miss the loc if you're local 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.290
 new and missing is still on the way 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.510
 You can still hit the vehicle and I 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.880
 I found that vehicle on this map was 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.460
 made exactly to defend charlie 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.560
 since he is born in the charlie who is the 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.740
 skyscraper place for those who do not know 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.890
 play from the skyscraper and only 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.650
 light infantry you use it too 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.990
 to defend these other flags 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.810
 even because that part of the streets is 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.810
 you have a very good coverage area 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.840
 with the boat and also you have an area 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.570
 of good coverage on the bridges, 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.880
 you can make it difficult for the enemy to pass 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.220
 for other vehicles with flags and 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.950
 Such a boat also has the milligan 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.780
 for other passengers than in the case 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.140
 would be that it modify in the helicopters 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.870
 transport system, such as the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.180
 Come on, I thought it was very hard for you. 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.250
 manages to kill infantry very easily 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.410
 with this gun I do not know if it's stronger 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.750
 that of the government but seems to be 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.390
 and you also have a position to 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.510
 shoot with rpg or even 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.510
 repair as if it were the beige book with 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.910
 sure the boat is a very good vehicle 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.700
 You see there I already destroyed and I saw 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.280
 also easily destroy tank and such 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.230
 just know how to use it and also goes 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.270
 depend a little on the map, right? 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.700
 since different maps quantities 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.940
 different positions that in the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.490
 vehicle is very important I am 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.550
 I really enjoyed the beta . 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.830
 neighborhood as I've said enough 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.860
 fun and eating everyone is testing 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.130
 he and the beta is very cool device already 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.020
 it's fantastic already in beta it does not have fps 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.120
 with a better appearance 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.580
 I really hope this game has 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.580
 strong competitive what else I'm 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.280
 wanting in this competitive game 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.890
 with enough championships there that get sick 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.170
 of a very good support because the profile 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.560
 out of 3 was meant to house the competitive you 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.500
 had tactical you had is a game that 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.470
 It was competitive but 10 did not 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.470
 support no not have spectrum did not have 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.400
 beautiful recorder in neighborhood 4 at least already 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.320
 there is the spectrum that already helps a lot more 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.720
 I really wanted to humberto too 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.970
 remembered and in the bar a son of three months 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.480
 with all these problems of lack of 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.070
 support had championships were also 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.820
 few but had also had a 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:46.040
 championship that was 12 thousand dollars 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.919
 shame it was not in Brazil right not okay 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.169
 also worth to Brazil was only for 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.590
 the united states but that's it, I just want 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.930
 a support for the competitive and in the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.419
 the text is all the vehicles I am 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.890
 trying to give you several tips 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.590
 Of course I can not give you many tips. 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.110
 also because since it's in the beta still 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.810
 many things can change but as in 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.450
 Last video I have enough tip already 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.000
 which were basic things for vehicles 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.180
 were mechanical that they implemented 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.610
 in the game and will definitely stay until the 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.430
 end of the game so that's why I got it 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.040
 is to give enough tips and if you have not seen 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.169
 check it out there because it's worth the last 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.570
 video will train so far and also in the 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.400
 description then tell me what you 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.070

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.110
 Helicopter Vehicle Infantry 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.970
 Anything and I just hope that you guys 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.860
 have enjoyed do not forget to give 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.009
 that strength of light by adding 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.319
