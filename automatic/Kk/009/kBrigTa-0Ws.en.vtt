00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.630
 hans this the notebooksbilliger block 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.599
 and we look here on the ces 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.860
 2014 at the booth of toshiba toshiba chrome 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.800
 or the first 3 cents should chrome os the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 first chromebook of toshiba I 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 even the chrome browser 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.710
 opened because that's just too 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.410
 the capital is actually we have 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.000
 For example, open a page here 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.870
 or here's a game even that works too 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.870
 liquid from here 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.079
 we are exactly how this is played 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.079
 but looks very nice 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.149
 Of course we can also google here 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.160
 For example, docs open once 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.019
 table cellar to operate again or 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.019
 to edit a document here 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.960
 just everything the google apps currently have 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.260
 Giving up example should be gmail 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.860
 google drive and visits to youtube 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.510
 google plus etc we met some 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.920
 games like you can see public 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.860
 half year browser again and we can 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.130
 then take care of the creams here 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.750
 buy different apps 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 why, of course, there are some 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.050
 which are free 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.050
 of optics ago, it looks a bit 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.830
 but aluminum is plastic and we 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.880
 have a 13 3 inch display is great 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.880
 they see how you can win a shone 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 bit and has a resolution of 1366 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.030
 x 768 pixels are below that 's mine here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.550
 Unfortunately, the chiclet keyboard does not 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.860
 lit and here also one more 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:53.700
 touchpad with integrated mouse buttons 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.260
 the webcam, for example, video calling 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.840
 to that I have here first 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.190
 toshiba logo and the company logo and one 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.990
 very nice surface on the left 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.170
 then a kernel singing kieler with 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.000
 you can steal any one here 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.040
 connection for the power supply sd 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 card reader and on the other side 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.090
 once a hdmi port usb one 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.330
 another usb port to the straight one 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.550
 Internet adapter infected so could 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.800
 so that cable into the internet that the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.430
 notebook itself has wlan and of course 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.430
 that is just the same 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.370
 main reason of this Chromebooks mobile 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.540
 to be on the way 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.930
 nine hours of battery life are up 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.810
 push here to an intel celeron 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.460
 processor and this is chromebook 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.710
 of course intended for all those 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.830
 very much anyway on the internet 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.800
 are in their browser and are on the go 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.380
 no other applications we need 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.830
 could you see we can even with google 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.090
 make google services a lot so that is 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.580
 there maybe no use for 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.580
 a pure culture a big notebook 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.140
 may not be for everyone 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.780
 suitable for example for heavy gema 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.620
 or for all the example videos 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.210
 want to edit 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.500
 because that does not work here because it 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.350
 there are no apps but there are no 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.030
 There is already a lot here and how to 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.400
 and you can see them all too 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.070
 really very fast and fast so that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.660
 the new toshiba kronburg 13 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.950
 and also the first of its kind 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.950
 maybe you are already
