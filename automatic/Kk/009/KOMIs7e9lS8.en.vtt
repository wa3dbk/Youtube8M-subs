00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:10.810
I think as I am more off the

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:12.578
field I am more of an angel than

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.047
a little devil.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.648
On the field one is always

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.318
different we try to be the best

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.587
and give the best for your

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.689
jersey but I think it's like my

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:26.726
girl used to say: if people

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.228
think that's how you are off the

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.064
field then they will think that

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.266
I must be in for it.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.168
It's really hard to have that

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.869
sort of image and that's why

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:39.338
when I do interviews I am a bit

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.841
shy, I don't like it to much so

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.576
that why I try to avoid these

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.278
things and also have to be

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:49.315
careful of what I say.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.853
Yes it's complicated, you must

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.189
pay a price for being famous.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:00.226
In everything form controversy 

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.130
from great moments, its hard to

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:08.534
live this kind of life but one

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:12.205
fought and suffered to get here

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.308
to triumph so the entire world

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.877
can speak for themselves.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.446
I think we must accept that I

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.116
was also a child I understand

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.884
the want of someone to get an

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.320
autograph that is all part of

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.721
football so one must be use to

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.524
all this.

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.394
I keep the sensation that I

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.396
helped my team.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.566
I prevented a goal and worse is

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.569
to prevent a goal and injure a

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.905
rival, injure badly and get

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.907
thrown out.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.575
Avoid a goal with my hand I

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.577
think I didn't hurt anybody.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.412
I just tried to avoid it and the

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.181
referee did the right thing he

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.349
threw me out and charged a

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.750
penalty.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:58.951
But the one who shot the penalty

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:00.753
was the Ghana player not me and

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.755
then cam the victory that

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.423
Uruguay won because of penalties

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:06.592
and that not a reason for me to

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.262
feel bad or something strange.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.530
The referee did what he had to

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.199
do I avoided a goal and I didn't

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:18.138
hit a rival nor hurt any one.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.612
I think there was hard times and

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:29.282
difficult ones but its better to

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.285
keep them as memories.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.854
But the best support I had was

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.323
with my wife and my daughter

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.358
then but now with my son I think

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.960
that is the best support I have,

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.962
and not to mention the family

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.797
that knows me very well.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.533
I think it was the support I

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.001
always had and my teammates that

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.804
known me for years.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.640
The teach always spoke wonders

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.643
of me and there is nothing but

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:00.713
gratefulness for trusting me

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:03.349
because they know who I am which

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:05.484
is nothing compared to the image

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.920
they were giving me.

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:10.022
I think these things make you

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:11.824
realize that you have to be

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.226
mature and that the attitude one

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.197
must have on the field.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.765
And with the national team it's

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:21.000
clear that the world cup is

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.002
present and its a dream

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.438
something that one doesn't stop

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.939
dreaming about the things that

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.941
can happen at a world cup but we

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:31.010
are also realistic about the

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:33.679
difficulties of football now a

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:35.848
days so we must go with a low

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.016
profile like we did in South

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.918
Africa to try to achieve

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.323
Uruguay's objective.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.958
I don't know if special but

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:48.527
there is a something nice about

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.896
it emotion because I would play

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.032
against a team from a country

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.034
where I play and know many

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:58.271
players I now how England plays

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.741
and I know what they say.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.543
 It's going to be wonderful to

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.879
play but without a doubt my mind

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.881
is on the first game against

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.050
Costa Rica which I the most

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.985
important game for us and then

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:18.358
will come England then Italy.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.561
It's clear that we can have many

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:25.898
opportunities to score, not only

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.734
with Cavani and Suarez but with

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:30.569
Forlan, Abel Hernandez many

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:32.405
other players that can

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.906
incorporate themselves forward

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.908
and score.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.410
There are many players that like

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.778
to score and live to score and

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.413
can help the team.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.915
If Suarez, Cavani, Forlan or any

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:45.418
other player score 3 or 4 goals

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.586
but the rivals score 5 on us

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:48.921
then it's worthless; but if the

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:51.424
group is united and the 11 that

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.793
came on the field play very well

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.761
then that is the best way that

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:57.496
Suarez, Cavani or any other

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.598
payer can score.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:01.600
I always say that if Uruguay

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:03.636
wins a game in a world cup 1-0

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.771
by a goal from Muslera at the

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:08.441
last minute that clearly makes

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:13.980
me happier than winning 3-2.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.618
Like I said I rather have

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:21.787
Uruguay win the world cup no

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.056
matter who scores.

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.959
if it is me obviously very happy

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:28.728
because I like to score but if

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.396
some else scores and Uruguay

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.132
advances to the final then

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:34.400
welcome.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:35.901
I have no ambition to be the

00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:37.737
world cup tops goal scorer or

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.770
anything.
