with this laundry detergent

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.290 
with this laundry detergent
you<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.650> not<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.100> use<00:02:14.250> hot<00:02:14.430> water<00:02:14.610> because

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you do not have to use hot water because

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.650 
you do not have to use hot water because
of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> enzyme<00:02:15.840> based<00:02:16.140> property<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:18.330> the

of the enzyme based property of in the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.840 
of the enzyme based property of in the
formula<00:02:19.080> don't<00:02:19.860> even<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> use

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
formula don't even you don't have to use

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.300 
formula don't even you don't have to use
hot<00:02:21.030> water<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.600> not<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.020> use<00:02:22.310> fabric

hot water do not have to use fabric

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.030 
hot water do not have to use fabric
software<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.180> alone<00:02:24.720> there's<00:02:25.530> there's<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
software so that alone there's there's a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.770 
software so that alone there's there's a
cost<00:02:26.280> savings<00:02:26.640> plus<00:02:26.910> they're<00:02:27.420> comparable

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
cost savings plus they're comparable

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.330 
cost savings plus they're comparable
price<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.410> basically<00:02:28.620> taking<00:02:29.220> your

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
price so it's basically taking your

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.380 
price so it's basically taking your
money<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> would<00:02:29.910> spend<00:02:30.150> and

money that you would spend and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.080 
money that you would spend and
transferring<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.410> over<00:02:32.100> into<00:02:32.700> an

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
transferring it over into an

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.510

environmentally<00:02:33.690> friendly<00:02:34.050> product<00:02:34.770> line<00:02:34.980> so
