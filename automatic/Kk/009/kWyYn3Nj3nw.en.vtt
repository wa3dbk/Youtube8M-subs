00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
yes um okay so the idea that they're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.210 
yes um okay so the idea that they're
sort<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> trying<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> do

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
sort of trying to get them to do

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
sort of trying to get them to do
something<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.850> should<00:01:21.390> willingly<00:01:21.780> do

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
something that they should willingly do

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
something that they should willingly do
considering<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.159> paying<00:01:23.430> like

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
considering that you're paying like

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
considering that you're paying like
forty<00:01:24.240> thousand<00:01:24.659> dollars<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.020> year<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.380> be

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
forty thousand dollars a year to be

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
forty thousand dollars a year to be
there<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.979> should<00:01:26.460> pay<00:01:26.610> attention<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
there you should pay attention and so it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
there you should pay attention and so it
seems<00:01:28.290> weird<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.920> try<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.820> them<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.479> pay

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
seems weird to try to get them to pay

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
seems weird to try to get them to pay
attention<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:32.159> an<00:01:32.220> adult

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
attention like it's there an adult

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
attention like it's there an adult
they're<00:01:32.759> paying<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> either<00:01:33.600> they'll<00:01:33.900> pay

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
they're paying for it either they'll pay

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.899 
they're paying for it either they'll pay
attention<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.590> won't<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.610> course<00:01:35.790> at

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
attention or they won't but of course at

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.480 
attention or they won't but of course at
the<00:01:36.000> same<00:01:36.180> time<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:37.409> school<00:01:37.740> has<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> vested

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the same time the school has a vested

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
the same time the school has a vested
interest<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> students<00:01:39.659> doing<00:01:39.840> well

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
interest in the students doing well

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840 
interest in the students doing well
because<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> reputation<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because they want the reputation and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
because they want the reputation and
everything<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> provides

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
everything so I think that that provides

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.410 
everything so I think that that provides
one<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.820> really<00:01:45.090> about<00:01:45.180> them

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
one way that it's not really about them

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
one way that it's not really about them
being<00:01:45.630> adults<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
being adults or not it's it's like a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.069 
being adults or not it's it's like a
business<00:01:48.090> sort<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> trying<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.899> motivate

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
business sort of trying to motivate

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289 
business sort of trying to motivate
their<00:01:49.649> employees<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> business<00:01:51.060> wants

their employees like the business wants

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.109 
their employees like the business wants

that you can be sort of not paying
attention<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.510> should<00:02:48.660> also<00:02:48.840> bear<00:02:49.170> in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
attention but we should also bear in

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.020 
attention but we should also bear in
mind<00:02:49.410> an<00:02:49.500> important<00:02:49.830> distinction<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.400> this

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
mind an important distinction that this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.090 
mind an important distinction that this

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
to get bonuses it's not that if you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
to get bonuses it's not that if you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.650 
would be I think people have more of a
problem<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.150> they<00:03:06.300> were<00:03:06.360> sort

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
problem with that is if they were sort

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.510 
problem with that is if they were sort
of<00:03:06.720> forcing<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.710> use<00:03:07.890> your<00:03:07.920> phone<00:03:08.250> at

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
of forcing you to not use your phone at

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.390 
of forcing you to not use your phone at
the<00:03:09.180> same<00:03:09.330> time<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.930> know<00:03:10.260> from<00:03:10.650> experience<00:03:10.800> is

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the same time I know from experience is

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.130 
the same time I know from experience is
extremely<00:03:11.940> difficult<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.420> go<00:03:12.540> even<00:03:12.840> more<00:03:12.870> than

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
extremely difficult to go even more than

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.360 
extremely difficult to go even more than
a<00:03:13.170> few<00:03:13.410> minutes<00:03:13.800> when<00:03:13.980> you're<00:03:14.070> not<00:03:14.160> doing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
a few minutes when you're not doing

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.740 
a few minutes when you're not doing
anything<00:03:14.400> else<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.970> not<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.300> get<00:03:15.420> your<00:03:15.600> phone

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
anything else and not to get your phone

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.180 
anything else and not to get your phone
like<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.020> you're<00:03:16.140> an<00:03:16.230> alliance<00:03:16.500> um<00:03:16.980> thing<00:03:17.100> like

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
like if you're an alliance um thing like

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.440 
like if you're an alliance um thing like
that<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.460> you're<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.730> red<00:03:17.880> light<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.330> you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that if you're the red light like you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.449 
that if you're the red light like you
just<00:03:18.690> want<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.110> have<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.290> out<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.250> think

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
just want to have it out and I think

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.870 
just want to have it out and I think
that<00:03:20.580> that's<00:03:20.610> kind<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.330> form<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.230> modern

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
that that's kind of a form of modern

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.550 
that that's kind of a form of modern
society<00:03:23.880> enforce<00:03:24.570> mental<00:03:24.930> illness<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
society enforce mental illness and so

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.960 
society enforce mental illness and so
maybe<00:03:25.739> they're<00:03:25.950> trying<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.250> help<00:03:26.430> deal<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
maybe they're trying to help deal is a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.910 
maybe they're trying to help deal is a
tech<00:03:27.300> like<00:03:27.480> I've<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.870> vacations<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:28.620> I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
tech like I've got on vacations where I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.350 
tech like I've got on vacations where I
wouldn't<00:03:29.550> have<00:03:29.640> cells<00:03:29.850> over<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> didn't

universities<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:48.480> guess<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.080> get<00:03:49.260> cool<00:03:49.680> points

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
universities already have instill this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.060 
universities already have instill this
Cal<00:03:59.550> State<00:03:59.850> Chico<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.270> Penn<00:04:00.870> State<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.500> they

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
Cal State Chico and Penn State and they

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.620 
Cal State Chico and Penn State and they
said<00:04:02.250> over<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:02.580> thousand<00:04:03.090> students<00:04:03.360> are<00:04:03.480> using

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630

said over a thousand students are using
it<00:04:03.959> now<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.320> guess<00:04:04.530> that's<00:04:04.770> good<00:04:05.010> that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
it now so I guess that's good that

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.130 
it now so I guess that's good that
they're<00:04:05.310> getting<00:04:05.459> like<00:04:05.850> more<00:04:06.150> food<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.020> now

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
we're gonna have students who don't use

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.100 
we're gonna have students who don't use
cell<00:04:08.790> phones<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.480> they're<00:04:09.600> eating<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.930> lot<00:04:10.050> of
