00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
weight and adjustable um is that rubber

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.719 
weight and adjustable um is that rubber
no<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.090> plastic<00:01:09.950> but<00:01:10.950> uh<00:01:10.979> okay

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
no it's just plastic but uh okay

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
no it's just plastic but uh okay
adjustable<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> double<00:01:13.020> bands<00:01:13.380> so
