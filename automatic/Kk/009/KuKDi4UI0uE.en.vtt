00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
now as this is an older PC game box we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
now as this is an older PC game box we
can<00:01:11.430> obviously<00:01:11.790> take<00:01:12.060> off<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> front<00:01:12.600> cover

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can obviously take off the front cover

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
can obviously take off the front cover
and<00:01:13.080> reveal<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> great<00:01:14.130> spread<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.420> first<00:01:15.720> off

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and reveal the great spread so first off

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570 
and reveal the great spread so first off
we<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.189> basically

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
we have it like this and it basically

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940 
we have it like this and it basically
just<00:01:17.820> describes<00:01:18.240> some<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> units<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.799> new

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
just describes some of the units or new

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.359 
just describes some of the units or new
ones<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> game<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.680> looks<00:01:23.070> pretty

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ones in the game so that looks pretty

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.660 
ones in the game so that looks pretty
great<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:26.280> increase

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
great and then we can actually increase

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
great and then we can actually increase
it<00:01:27.290> by<00:01:28.290> another<00:01:28.590> full<00:01:28.890> page<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.520> kinda

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it by another full page so it's kinda

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.270 
it by another full page so it's kinda
hard<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> fit<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> camera<00:01:31.280> but

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
hard to fit all this in the camera but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
hard to fit all this in the camera but
we<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.610> great<00:01:32.820> spread<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.590> also<00:01:34.710> get

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we get this great spread and we also get

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.960 
we get this great spread and we also get
information<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.270> four<00:01:36.570> new<00:01:36.600> main<00:01:37.259> heroes
