of<00:00:47.920> coconut<00:00:48.489> nectar<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.930> reason<00:00:50.199> why<00:00:50.290> I

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
of coconut nectar and the reason why I

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.829 
of coconut nectar and the reason why I
picked<00:00:50.710> coconut<00:00:51.250> nectar<00:00:51.400> of<00:00:51.760> our<00:00:52.150> maple<00:00:52.360> syrup

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
picked coconut nectar of our maple syrup

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.750 
picked coconut nectar of our maple syrup
is<00:00:52.989> because<00:00:53.350> it's<00:00:53.500> a<00:00:53.619> low<00:00:53.860> glycemic<00:00:54.460> sweetener

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
is because it's a low glycemic sweetener

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.270 
is because it's a low glycemic sweetener
it's<00:00:55.720> much<00:00:56.080> better<00:00:56.320> for<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.650> while<00:00:57.190> you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.950 
it's much better for you while you
cleansing<00:00:57.820> because<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:58.239> don't<00:00:58.449> want<00:00:58.659> too

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
cleansing because you don't want too

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.170 
cleansing because you don't want too
much<00:00:59.140> sugar<00:00:59.559> in<00:00:59.710> your<00:00:59.799> system<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.549> coconut

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
much sugar in your system so coconut

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.899

nectar<00:01:01.600> right<00:01:01.989> here<00:01:02.409> is<00:01:02.589> much<00:01:03.040> better<00:01:03.339> and<00:01:03.729> I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
nectar right here is much better and I

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.289 
nectar right here is much better and I
believe<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.449> Stanley<00:01:04.720> Burroughs<00:01:05.080> was<00:01:05.799> alive

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
believe it Stanley Burroughs was alive

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.859 
believe it Stanley Burroughs was alive
he<00:01:07.299> will<00:01:07.539> pick<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.079> sweetener<00:01:08.590> as<00:01:08.799> well<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
he will pick that sweetener as well the

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.510 
he will pick that sweetener as well the
reason<00:01:11.140> there's<00:01:11.289> five<00:01:11.500> bottles<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.130> because

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
reason there's five bottles is because

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.069 
reason there's five bottles is because
you<00:01:12.759> will<00:01:12.880> go<00:01:13.060> through<00:01:13.090> approximately<00:01:14.049> a

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
you will go through approximately a

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.190 
you will go through approximately a
bottle<00:01:14.619> every<00:01:14.799> two<00:01:15.280> days<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:16.329> cleanse<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:16.840> ten

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.469 
bottle every two days the cleanse is ten
days<00:01:17.439> so<00:01:17.829> this<00:01:18.100> should<00:01:18.369> be<00:01:18.549> good<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.909> cover<00:01:19.240> you

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
pepper but you can swallow those so this

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.770 
pepper but you can swallow those so this
