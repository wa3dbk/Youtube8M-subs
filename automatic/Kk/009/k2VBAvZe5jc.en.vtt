their<00:03:58.470> own<00:03:58.590> very<00:03:59.400> very<00:03:59.640> close<00:03:59.880> against<00:04:00.240> the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
their own very very close against the

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.180 
their own very very close against the
team<00:04:00.570> we're<00:04:01.020> watching<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.500> game<00:04:01.680> with<00:04:02.040> the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
team we're watching a game with the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.170 
team we're watching a game with the
chief<00:04:02.430> theme<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.180> Pioneers<00:04:03.870> think<00:04:04.830> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
chief theme and the Pioneers think the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.850 
chief theme and the Pioneers think the
Chiefs<00:04:06.180> started<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.690> very<00:04:06.720> strong<00:04:07.110> bodily

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
Chiefs started out very strong bodily

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.830 
Chiefs started out very strong bodily
really<00:04:08.340> hurting<00:04:08.670> them<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.450> second

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
really hurting them but in the second

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.600 
really hurting them but in the second
half<00:04:10.020> of<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.170> game<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.830> little<00:04:11.220> man<00:04:11.340> came

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
half of that game the little man came

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.250 
half of that game the little man came
back<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.060> think<00:04:12.240> they<00:04:12.510> burned<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.930> big<00:04:13.080> guy

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
back on I think they burned the big guy

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.620 
back on I think they burned the big guy
out<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.740> I<00:04:14.670> think<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.210> going<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.420> be<00:04:15.540> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
out and I think that's going to be the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.570 
out and I think that's going to be the
whole<00:04:15.780> thing<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:16.230> a<00:04:16.650> nutshell<00:04:16.680> it's<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.370> matter

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
whole thing in a nutshell it's a matter

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.750 
whole thing in a nutshell it's a matter
of<00:04:18.290> shape<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.160> going<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.430> equal<00:04:20.730> to

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
of shape this is going to be equal to

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760 
of shape this is going to be equal to
this<00:04:20.970> game<00:04:21.210> comparing<00:04:22.020> your<00:04:22.260> team<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:22.680> his
