00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to explain how to make a heart of your hair  

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have this half already braided  

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you start dividing your hear into two parts  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
when it is ready  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
then you go on top of the head  

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to divide the hair diagonally to the ear 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the back of the hair I put in place with a rubber band  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so it does not get in the way of my braid

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when it is ready than you go at this point to start with braiding  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you take a lock of hair  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
divide into three strands  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
braid once on the normal way  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
every time you take a strand of hair on the left braid it along and you do that only on the left  

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If you come to the ear and all the hair is braided along then braid your hair as usual with three strands  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
secure it with a rubber band  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
well

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I make the ponytail loose  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I comb the remaining hair well  

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I take the two braided strands together  

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and secure with a rubber band  

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
now is your braided heart ready and it looks like this
