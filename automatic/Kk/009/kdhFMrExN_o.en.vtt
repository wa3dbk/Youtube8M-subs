00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
hey all welcome to a fistful of dice my

hey all welcome to a fistful of dice my
name<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.189> Matt<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.059> video<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.389> going

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
name is Matt in this video we're going

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.970 
name is Matt in this video we're going
to<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.630> expanding<00:00:09.960> upon<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> concept<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:10.920> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
to be expanding upon a concept that I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.190 
to be expanding upon a concept that I
introduced<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.639> my<00:00:11.820> d-dear<00:00:12.300> Aces<00:00:12.719> High<00:00:12.960> Elves

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
introduced in my d-dear Aces High Elves

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.589 
introduced in my d-dear Aces High Elves
video<00:00:13.590> which<00:00:13.830> I'll<00:00:13.980> link<00:00:14.130> down<00:00:14.219> below<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
video which I'll link down below and the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.970 
video which I'll link down below and the
idea<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.830> obser<00:00:17.570> a<00:00:18.980> progenitor

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
idea is that of the obser a progenitor

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630 
idea is that of the obser a progenitor
race<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:21.240> spawned<00:00:21.689> orcs<00:00:22.410> elves<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> humans

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
race which spawned orcs elves and humans

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.300 
race which spawned orcs elves and humans
what<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.810> trying<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.230> was<00:00:25.529> come<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.800> with

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
what I was trying to do was come up with

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.630 
what I was trying to do was come up with
a<00:00:26.599> logical<00:00:27.599> explanation<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:28.439> why<00:00:28.640> elves

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
a logical explanation for why elves

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
a logical explanation for why elves
humans<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.179> orcs<00:00:30.390> were<00:00:30.689> all<00:00:30.840> able<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.230> breed

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
humans and orcs were all able to breed

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.229 
humans and orcs were all able to breed
with<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.890> another<00:00:32.160> producing<00:00:32.969> viable

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
with one another producing viable

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.990 
with one another producing viable
offspring<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.190> none<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.520> races

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
offspring and none of the other races

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.069 
offspring and none of the other races
were<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> came<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> concept<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
were so I came up with the concept of

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.020 
were so I came up with the concept of
orcs<00:00:40.079> elves<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.590> humans<00:00:40.770> being<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.579> ring

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
orcs elves and humans being a ring

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.869 
orcs elves and humans being a ring
species<00:00:42.379> meaning<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> they've<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.370> evolved

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
species meaning that they've all evolved

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
species meaning that they've all evolved
down<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.390> paths<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.960> progressed

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
down different paths and progressed

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470 
down different paths and progressed
differently<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.850> still<00:00:48.149> possess

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
differently but they still possess

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.560 
differently but they still possess
enough<00:00:48.950> similar<00:00:49.950> genetics<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.760> breed<00:00:51.539> with

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
enough similar genetics to breed with

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.750 
enough similar genetics to breed with
one<00:00:51.840> another<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> obso

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one another so the way I see it the obso

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.110 
one another so the way I see it the obso
was<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.500> culture<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.649> existed<00:00:56.129> millions<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
was a culture that existed millions of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.049 
was a culture that existed millions of
years<00:00:57.270> ago<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.870> far<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:59.059> they're

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
years ago so far back that they're

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.790 
years ago so far back that they're
legendary<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.930> lot<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> people<00:01:01.530> aren't<00:01:01.739> aware

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
legendary a lot of people aren't aware

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.429 
legendary a lot of people aren't aware
of<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.570> believe<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:03.960> existed

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of them or don't believe they existed

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
of them or don't believe they existed
and<00:01:04.619> maybe<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:04.949> don't<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.930> more

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and maybe they don't but the more

learned and educated people of the world
kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.420> agree<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> most<00:01:10.590> viable

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
kind of agree this is the most viable

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
kind of agree this is the most viable
theory<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.090> based<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> evidence

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
theory and based on some of the evidence

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.310 
theory and based on some of the evidence
that<00:01:14.159> they've<00:01:14.369> uncovered<00:01:14.960> they<00:01:15.960> believe<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that they've uncovered they believe that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
that they've uncovered they believe that
the<00:01:16.439> obso

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the obso

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.480 
the obso
real<00:01:18.689> no<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.619> knows<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
real no one really knows what the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
real no one really knows what the
opposite<00:01:20.909> looked<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.810> their

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
opposite looked like or what their

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
opposite looked like or what their
culture<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.090> theorized<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
culture was like but it's theorized that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
culture was like but it's theorized that
they<00:01:25.020> looked<00:01:25.290> most<00:01:25.619> similar<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.240> humans

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they looked most similar to humans

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.069 
they looked most similar to humans
because<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.500> humans<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> closest<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
because the humans are the closest to

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
because the humans are the closest to
the<00:01:31.079> OPSEU<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.159> nowadays<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.299> one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the OPSEU as we have nowadays so at one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
the OPSEU as we have nowadays so at one
point<00:01:33.450> millions<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> millions<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.860> years<00:01:35.100> ago

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
point millions and millions of years ago

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.960 
point millions and millions of years ago
there<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.090> event<00:01:36.420> known<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.829> convergence

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
there was an event known as convergence

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.399 
there was an event known as convergence
essentially<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.299> way<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> plains<00:01:39.840> work<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
essentially the way the plains work is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.170 
essentially the way the plains work is
right<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.549> prime<00:01:41.850> or

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
right here you have the prime or

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
right here you have the prime or
material<00:01:42.689> plane<00:01:42.930> which<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.680> all

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
material plane which is where we all

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.109 
material plane which is where we all
live<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.430> FEI<00:01:47.640> wild

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
live and then you have the FEI wild

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.230 
live and then you have the FEI wild
which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> mirror<00:01:49.380> image<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.729> prime<00:01:51.000> or

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
which is a mirror image of the prime or

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.170 
which is a mirror image of the prime or
material<00:01:51.720> plane<00:01:52.020> however<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> overrun

material plane however it is overrun

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.230 
material plane however it is overrun
with<00:01:54.390> wild<00:01:55.020> arcane<00:01:55.500> magic<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.250> Fae<00:01:56.729> creatures

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with wild arcane magic and Fae creatures

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.830 
with wild arcane magic and Fae creatures
and<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> where<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.840> fairy

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
and this is where you know fairy

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
and this is where you know fairy
creatures<00:02:01.140> come<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.649> satyrs<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.210> that

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
shadows very similar to those of the

shadow fell awaited them and the humans

shadow fell awaited them and the humans
kind<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.419> stayed<00:04:19.989> where<00:04:20.200> they<00:04:20.320> were

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
kind of stayed where they were

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.409 
kind of stayed where they were
establishing<00:04:21.280> their<00:04:21.400> cities<00:04:21.700> along

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
establishing their cities along

riverbanks and along the coast

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.080 
riverbanks and along the coast
eventually<00:04:25.500> these<00:04:25.680> three<00:04:26.069> races<00:04:26.310> would<00:04:26.759> spawn

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
eventually these three races would spawn

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.420 
eventually these three races would spawn
a<00:04:27.449> dozen<00:04:27.810> sub<00:04:28.080> races<00:04:28.439> of<00:04:28.590> their<00:04:28.710> own<00:04:28.889> different

a dozen sub races of their own different

human different sub races of elves like

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.249 
human different sub races of elves like
what<00:04:34.409> elves<00:04:34.889> drow<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.789> moon<00:04:35.969> elves<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.599> after

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
what elves drow and moon elves and after

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.800 
what elves drow and moon elves and after
millions<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.830> years<00:04:38.099> these<00:04:38.669> three<00:04:39.090> distinct

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
millions of years these three distinct

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.749 
millions of years these three distinct
sub-races<00:04:40.229> progressed<00:04:40.830> farther<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.550> farther

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
sub-races progressed farther and farther

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.600 
sub-races progressed farther and farther
apart<00:04:42.090> until<00:04:42.680> aside<00:04:43.680> from<00:04:43.889> being<00:04:44.069> mammalian

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
apart until aside from being mammalian

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.369 
apart until aside from being mammalian
humanoids<00:04:45.120> didn't<00:04:45.599> really<00:04:45.870> resemble<00:04:46.289> each

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
humanoids didn't really resemble each

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.480 
humanoids didn't really resemble each
other<00:04:46.590> anymore<00:04:47.000> but<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.889> genetic<00:04:49.889> piece<00:04:50.219> of

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
other anymore but that genetic piece of

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.490 
other anymore but that genetic piece of
their<00:04:50.639> code<00:04:50.939> that<00:04:51.389> at<00:04:51.509> one<00:04:51.719> time<00:04:51.990> made<00:04:52.289> them

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
their code that at one time made them

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.420 
their code that at one time made them
all<00:04:52.710> obso<00:04:53.580> still<00:04:54.539> remains<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.289> that's<00:04:55.889> why

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
all obso still remains and that's why

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.029 
all obso still remains and that's why
they're<00:04:56.580> able<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.819> produce<00:04:56.969> viable<00:04:57.479> offspring

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
they're able to produce viable offspring

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.350 
they're able to produce viable offspring
so<00:04:59.039> that's<00:04:59.190> kind<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.460> how<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.639> see<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.090> an

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
so that's kind of how I see it an

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.649 
so that's kind of how I see it an
interesting<00:05:01.199> take<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.620> think<00:05:02.479> let<00:05:03.479> me<00:05:03.539> know

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
interesting take I think let me know

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.119 
interesting take I think let me know
your<00:05:03.840> thoughts<00:05:03.870> are<00:05:04.289> on<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.530> or<00:05:04.770> if<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:04.979> have

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
your thoughts are on this or if you have

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.770 
your thoughts are on this or if you have
a<00:05:05.159> different<00:05:05.430> explanation<00:05:05.759> for<00:05:06.270> why<00:05:06.389> certain

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
a different explanation for why certain

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.629 
a different explanation for why certain
races<00:05:07.349> are<00:05:07.440> able<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.740> breed<00:05:08.099> with<00:05:08.250> one<00:05:08.370> another

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
races are able to breed with one another

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.409 
races are able to breed with one another
and<00:05:08.879> certain<00:05:09.449> races<00:05:09.810> aren't<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:11.180> sort<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.240> like

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
and certain races aren't I sort of like

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.649 
and certain races aren't I sort of like
this<00:05:12.599> idea<00:05:12.780> because<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.379> combines<00:05:14.599> sort<00:05:15.599> of

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
this idea because it combines sort of

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.350 
this idea because it combines sort of
the<00:05:15.840> theory<00:05:16.199> of<00:05:16.229> evolution<00:05:16.349> with<00:05:17.180> magic<00:05:18.180> did

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
the theory of evolution with magic did

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.459 
the theory of evolution with magic did
it<00:05:18.479> which<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.020> know<00:05:19.139> your<00:05:19.289> go-to

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
it which is you know your go-to

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:20.930 
it which is you know your go-to
explanation<00:05:20.190> if<00:05:20.279> you're<00:05:20.400> creating<00:05:20.729> a<00:05:20.759> world

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
explanation if you're creating a world

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.519 
explanation if you're creating a world
and<00:05:21.120> your<00:05:21.210> players<00:05:21.389> are<00:05:21.599> like<00:05:21.750> how<00:05:22.050> does<00:05:22.110> this

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
and your players are like how does this

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.100 
and your players are like how does this
work<00:05:22.770> you<00:05:22.949> just<00:05:23.039> go<00:05:23.250> magic<00:05:23.520> did<00:05:23.819> it<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.990> it's

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
work you just go magic did it so it's

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.540 
work you just go magic did it so it's
kind<00:05:25.289> of<00:05:25.319> a<00:05:25.409> fun<00:05:25.590> combination<00:05:25.830> of<00:05:26.219> those<00:05:26.340> two

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
kind of a fun combination of those two
