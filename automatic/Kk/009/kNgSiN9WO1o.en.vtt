old Louet i contacted two Louet dealer
and<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.450> able<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> handful<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.829> them

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.389 
and was able to get a handful of them
very<00:00:47.309> inexpensively<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.320> construct<00:00:49.860> my

these videos and therefore the winding
is<00:02:02.720> much<00:02:02.990> smoother<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.100> have<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.340> great<00:02:04.670> deal

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
is much smoother you have a great deal

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.060 
is much smoother you have a great deal
of<00:02:04.939> control<00:02:05.479> about<00:02:05.899> how<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.229> cross<00:02:06.740> wine

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
of control about how the cross wine

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.490 
of control about how the cross wine
works<00:02:07.490> once<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.450> get<00:02:08.660> used<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.289> motion

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
works once you get used to the motion

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.610 
works once you get used to the motion
you<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.489> wind<00:02:10.729> faster<00:02:11.300> slow<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.410> can

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you can wind faster slow and you can

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.130 
you can wind faster slow and you can
make<00:02:12.830> your<00:02:13.099> cones<00:02:13.400> bottom<00:02:13.970> heavy<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.540> do

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
make your cones bottom heavy and do

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.530 
make your cones bottom heavy and do
pretty<00:02:15.830> much<00:02:15.920> anything<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.700> want<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
pretty much anything you want with the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.340 
pretty much anything you want with the
winding<00:02:17.959> motion<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:20.660> may<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:21.170> get

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
winding motion you may have to get

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.680 
winding motion you may have to get
creative<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.980> create<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.519> base<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.239> your<00:02:23.299> cone

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
creative to create a base for your cone

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259 
creative to create a base for your cone
in<00:02:23.989> one<00:02:24.590> case<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.130> see<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.400> used<00:02:25.790> something

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
in one case you see I used something

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.780 
in one case you see I used something
that<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.510> started<00:02:26.900> out<00:02:27.049> as<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.350> lid<00:02:27.769> for<00:02:28.489> some

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that it started out as a lid for some

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.330 
that it started out as a lid for some
sort<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.150> throwaway<00:02:29.750> jar<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:31.069> another

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
sort of throwaway jar and in another

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.780 
sort of throwaway jar and in another
case<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.060> used<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.870> CD<00:02:33.380> both<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.370> them<00:02:34.549> actually

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
case I used a CD both of them actually

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.479 
case I used a CD both of them actually
work<00:02:35.330> very<00:02:35.360> well<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.530> point<00:02:36.799> is<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.160> create

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
work very well the point is to create

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.300 
work very well the point is to create
something<00:02:37.819> broad<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.870> stable<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:40.010> when

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
something broad and stable so that when

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.520 
something broad and stable so that when
you<00:02:40.430> stand<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.849> cone<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.450> knit<00:02:41.660> from<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
you stand the cone up to knit from it it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.099 
you stand the cone up to knit from it it
does<00:02:42.799> so
