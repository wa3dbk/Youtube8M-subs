00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
really think they have the right wrong

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
really think they have the right wrong
price<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> got<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:32.940> over<00:00:33.059> there

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
price on that so I got to go over there

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360

new transia burner an actual Trangia

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.719 
new transia burner an actual Trangia
burner<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> price<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:07.369> was<00:02:08.369> surprised

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
burner for the price I was surprised

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
burner for the price I was surprised
this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.030> lighter<00:02:09.989> than<00:02:10.349> what<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.500> thought<00:02:10.739> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
this is lighter than what I thought it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.480 
this is lighter than what I thought it
would<00:02:11.009> be

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
would be

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.790 
would be
this<00:02:13.030> actually<00:02:13.540> weighs<00:02:13.750> 170<00:02:14.560> 7.1<00:02:15.490> grams<00:02:15.880> or

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
this actually weighs 170 7.1 grams or

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.790 
this actually weighs 170 7.1 grams or
six<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.190> quarter<00:02:18.490> ounces<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.620> have

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
six and a quarter ounces now I have

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.710 
six and a quarter ounces now I have
another<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.280> was<00:02:21.430> from<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> fondue<00:02:22.210> set<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
another one that was from a fondue set I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.480 
another one that was from a fondue set I
think<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.380> must<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.680> made<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.010> iron<00:02:24.190> or

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
think it must be made of iron or

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.190 
think it must be made of iron or
something<00:02:24.760> it's<00:02:25.120> much<00:02:25.390> much<00:02:25.660> heavier<00:02:25.930> than

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
something it's much much heavier than

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.800 
something it's much much heavier than
this<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.540> today<00:02:28.710> I'll<00:02:29.710> do<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> boil<00:02:30.310> test<00:02:30.810> using

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
this so today I'll do a boil test using

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.600 
this so today I'll do a boil test using

will burn for approximately twenty five

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.050 
will burn for approximately twenty five
minutes<00:03:49.820> pretty<00:03:50.820> cool<00:03:52.400> okay<00:03:53.400> there<00:03:53.580> we<00:03:53.670> got<00:03:53.850> a

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
minutes pretty cool okay there we got a

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.640 
minutes pretty cool okay there we got a
blossom<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.890> two<00:03:56.040> cups<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:57.230> which<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.440> up

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
blossom I have two cups here which is up

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
blossom I have two cups here which is up
to<00:03:58.980> about<00:03:59.450> the<00:04:00.450> half<00:04:00.720> liter<00:04:01.080> mark<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.710> guess<00:04:02.520> it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
to about the half liter mark I guess it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.500 
to about the half liter mark I guess it
should<00:04:02.880> be<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> two<00:04:04.710> cups<00:04:05.160> sixty<00:04:05.880> degrees<00:04:06.210> I'm

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
should be so two cups sixty degrees I'm

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.260 
should be so two cups sixty degrees I'm
going<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.690> use<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.110> frying<00:04:07.410> pan<00:04:07.680> as<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.980> top

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
going to use the frying pan as the top
