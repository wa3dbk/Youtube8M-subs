some deadlifts going on today we did a
deficit<00:00:12.269> poll<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:13.170> five<00:00:13.440> sets<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.860> one

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
deficit poll for about five sets of one

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.000 
deficit poll for about five sets of one
and<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:15.210> took<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> deficit<00:00:16.109> away<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.859> only

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and then took the deficit away it's only

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.179 
and then took the deficit away it's only
a<00:00:17.100> one-inch<00:00:17.520> deficit<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.980> found

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a one-inch deficit but we have found
