00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.670

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 Now what does Sarah have theirs for ? 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.110
 clever books 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.780
 there is surely something in it about that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.219
 word quiz how the word came about 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 There is a beautiful 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 history 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 We are located in Ireland on the 18th 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 In the twentieth century the dublin lived 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 theater director minister daily daley was 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.409
 someone who liked to play cards and who 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.510
 also like to bet and in 1791 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.760
 should have completed a bet the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.299
 quite decisively with our question too 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.299
 has to do 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.960
 Bet that I can do it within 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.090
 one day a word in English 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.790
 to introduce language what it is so far 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.100
 not yet exist 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.800
 his friends were skeptical about this 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.810
 It was impossible but she let herself 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.440
 do not be fooled and so beat the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.270
 Finally, friends in the bet 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.320
 then he played a very relaxed one 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.150
 last round 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.090
 Linde already had a good one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.590
 thoughtful plan 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.750
 when it was dark he sneaked 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.119
 Carefully through the deserted 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950
 streets of Dublin and wrote down a word 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:02.090
 the walls he foreshadowed 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:04.009
 The word quiz was invented on 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.229
 next morning as the first residents 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.090
 they came out of their houses 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.739
 everywhere this word written 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.450
 nobody could do anything with it 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.860
 the word did not exist until then 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.270
 but everybody talked about it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.459
 With that delhi had won his bet 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.180
 and the word quiz flowed into the 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.590
 everyday a voice-to-use 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.230
 if this story really does that 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.030
 happened we do not know exactly what 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.280
 But we know that the word quiz 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.590
 from English comes that since 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.049
 exists at the end of the 18th century 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.360
 and original or funny kauz 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:42.290
 meant that fits then again 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.290
 to mister daily today it will be today 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.489
 it is still used in many countries 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.750
 its meaning has changed 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:54.100
 to tests or exams that's right 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.930
 sarah you have I can you say yes 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.590

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.680
 won 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.280
 it starts with wlan and you have two 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.280
 minutes of time 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.220
 Sarah then took rate before beautiful 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.400
 two minutes are pretty fast 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.400
 past
