also moving on we've got air there's a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.670 
also moving on we've got air there's a
lot<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.329> wind<00:02:03.570> turbines<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> look<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> kind

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lot of wind turbines and look the kind

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440 
lot of wind turbines and look the kind
of<00:02:04.770> there's<00:02:05.040> lot<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.250> obstacles<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.119> appear

of there's lot of obstacles that appear
to<00:02:06.479> kind<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.170> diversify<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> fights<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
to kind of diversify the fights that you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.760 
to kind of diversify the fights that you

have the dog fights with the jet and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.130 
have the dog fights with the jet and
it's<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> clear<00:02:12.629> air<00:02:12.840> space

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it's not just like a clear air space

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.920 
it's not just like a clear air space
because<00:02:13.560> there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
because there

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.559 
because there
lowered<00:02:14.439> and<00:02:14.650> hired<00:02:15.189> the<00:02:15.489> blimps<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:15.969> all<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
lowered and hired the blimps and all the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.670 
lowered and hired the blimps and all the
Zeppelin's<00:02:16.989> like<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.200> want<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.409> call<00:02:17.560> them

Zeppelin's like you want to call them

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.649 
Zeppelin's like you want to call them
and<00:02:17.859> that<00:02:18.730> they're<00:02:18.879> trying<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.239> made<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.510> more

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
and that they're trying to made it more

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.420 
and that they're trying to made it more
interesting<00:02:20.049> as<00:02:20.500> obstacles<00:02:20.859> you<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.189> fly

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
interesting as obstacles you have to fly

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.130 
interesting as obstacles you have to fly
around<00:02:21.519> it's<00:02:21.849> not<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.180> clear<00:02:22.510> air<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:22.989> that's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
around it's not just clear air so that's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.319 
around it's not just clear air so that's
it<00:02:23.290> that's<00:02:23.560> kind<00:02:23.799> of<00:02:23.829> interesting<00:02:24.329> also

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
it that's kind of interesting also

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.780 
it that's kind of interesting also
they've<00:02:25.900> got<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.140> lot<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.590> people<00:02:27.040> will<00:02:27.280> spend<00:02:27.549> a

they've got a lot of people will spend a
lot<00:02:27.939> of<00:02:27.969> time<00:02:28.060> around<00:02:28.540> these<00:02:28.959> blimps<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.500> as

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
lot of time around these blimps so as

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
lot of time around these blimps so as
you<00:02:29.799> can<00:02:29.859> see<00:02:30.069> here<00:02:30.250> there's<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.609> be<00:02:30.639> a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
you can see here there's going to be a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.160 
you can see here there's going to be a
lot<00:02:30.939> of<00:02:31.030> people<00:02:31.209> around<00:02:31.480> these<00:02:31.750> blimps<00:02:32.049> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
lot of people around these blimps and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.349 
lot of people around these blimps and
that's<00:02:33.099> pretty<00:02:33.280> much<00:02:33.400> where<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.239> whole

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
that's pretty much where the whole

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.539 
that's pretty much where the whole
action<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.840> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.049> be<00:02:35.230> there's<00:02:36.010> also<00:02:36.159> going

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
action is going to be there's also going

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.250 
action is going to be there's also going
to<00:02:36.670> be<00:02:36.790> as<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.389> said<00:02:37.569> don't<00:02:37.750> get<00:02:37.870> too<00:02:38.019> close<00:02:38.170> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
to be as I said don't get too close to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.229 
to be as I said don't get too close to
them<00:02:38.409> because<00:02:38.590> here<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.069> will<00:02:39.189> see<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:40.209> will

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
them because here you will see you will

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.000 
them because here you will see you will
fly<00:02:40.480> into<00:02:40.629> them<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.139> will<00:02:41.560> crash<00:02:41.829> and

kind of part the scenery here I count

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.759 
kind of part the scenery here I count
five<00:03:03.939> jets<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.540> about<00:03:04.719> two<00:03:04.989> blimps<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.560> kind

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
five jets and about two blimps that kind

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.170 
five jets and about two blimps that kind
of<00:03:05.799> shows<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.219> scale<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.519> how<00:03:06.790> many<00:03:06.849> vehicles

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.420 
of shows the scale of how many vehicles
you<00:03:07.629> can<00:03:07.659> actually<00:03:08.260> get<00:03:08.469> there's<00:03:09.280> also

another<00:03:10.180> thing<00:03:10.419> is<00:03:10.810> about<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.379> actual<00:03:11.650> game

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
another thing is about the actual game

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.229 
another thing is about the actual game
mode<00:03:11.950> itself<00:03:12.250> how<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.519> points<00:03:12.909> work<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
mode itself how the points work the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.240 
mode itself how the points work the
amount<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.569> jets<00:03:13.870> vs<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.469> any<00:03:14.560> friendly<00:03:15.040> jets

vs enemy jets in the air determines how

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.099 
vs enemy jets in the air determines how
fast<00:03:17.739> your<00:03:18.220> tickets<00:03:18.489> go<00:03:18.609> down<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.269> if<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.900> have

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
fast your tickets go down so if you have

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.629 
fast your tickets go down so if you have
more<00:03:20.319> friendly<00:03:20.650> jets<00:03:20.889> in<00:03:20.979> the<00:03:21.069> air<00:03:21.159> then<00:03:21.310> enemy

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
more friendly jets in the air then enemy

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.309 
more friendly jets in the air then enemy
Jets<00:03:21.849> then<00:03:22.269> you're<00:03:22.419> going<00:03:22.599> to<00:03:22.659> be<00:03:22.780> winning<00:03:23.079> and

Jets fast and they're like and they're
all<00:03:27.430> probably<00:03:27.849> being<00:03:28.120> destroyed<00:03:28.449> quickly

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
all probably being destroyed quickly

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
flying around there's going to be

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.780

collision<00:03:59.919> people<00:04:00.220> gonna<00:04:00.340> crash<00:04:00.549> into<00:04:00.729> each

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
collision people gonna crash into each

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.339 
collision people gonna crash into each
other<00:04:00.879> and<00:04:01.120> it's<00:04:01.209> going<00:04:01.329> to<00:04:01.419> happen<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.930> I

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
other and it's going to happen and I

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.479 
other and it's going to happen and I
think<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.709> gonna<00:04:02.799> make<00:04:02.919> for<00:04:02.979> some<00:04:03.459> pretty

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
think it's gonna make for some pretty

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.559 
think it's gonna make for some pretty
interesting<00:04:03.939> gameplay<00:04:04.359> and<00:04:05.519> also<00:04:06.519> I'm<00:04:07.389> not

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
interesting gameplay and also I'm not

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.939 
interesting gameplay and also I'm not
sure<00:04:07.780> whether<00:04:08.019> this<00:04:08.319> is<00:04:08.379> one<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.739> four

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
sure whether this is one of the four

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.939 
sure whether this is one of the four
maps<00:04:09.159> as<00:04:09.519> part<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.389> endgame<00:04:10.959> or<00:04:11.439> whether<00:04:11.769> it's

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
maps as part of endgame or whether it's

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.520 
maps as part of endgame or whether it's
just<00:04:12.159> an<00:04:12.280> extended<00:04:12.729> part<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.209> an<00:04:13.689> existing<00:04:14.379> map

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
just an extended part of an existing map

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.379 
just an extended part of an existing map
or<00:04:14.949> whether<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.220> gets<00:04:15.310> its<00:04:15.549> own<00:04:15.669> specific<00:04:15.970> lap

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
or whether it gets its own specific lap

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.360 
or whether it gets its own specific lap
I'm<00:04:16.539> really<00:04:16.780> not<00:04:16.870> sure<00:04:16.930> about<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.349> but<00:04:17.650> this

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
I'm really not sure about that but this

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.430 
I'm really not sure about that but this
does<00:04:18.639> seem<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.239> be<00:04:19.659> in<00:04:19.870> its<00:04:20.019> own<00:04:20.169> kind<00:04:20.320> of

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
does seem to be in its own kind of

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.409 
does seem to be in its own kind of
airspace<00:04:20.799> because<00:04:21.159> there's<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:21.729> lot<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:22.060> like

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
airspace because there's a lot of like
