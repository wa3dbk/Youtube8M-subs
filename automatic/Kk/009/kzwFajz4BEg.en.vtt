bullpen mindset you know as time goes on
you<00:00:22.710> know<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.010> was<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> starter<00:00:23.609> coming<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.000> but

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
you know I was a starter coming up but

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
you know I was a starter coming up but
as<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.449> goes<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.619> embrace<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
as time goes on you you embrace the the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450 
as time goes on you you embrace the the
craziness<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> bullpen<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:29.099> turn

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
craziness that is the bullpen so in turn

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.720 
craziness that is the bullpen so in turn
we<00:00:29.699> become<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.269> bit<00:00:30.480> crazy<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.730> you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
we become a little bit crazy and you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.030 
we become a little bit crazy and you
know<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> end<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> day<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
know but at the end of the day we this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
know but at the end of the day we this
year<00:00:35.309> has<00:00:35.460> been<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.820> been<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.120> nice<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
year has been it's been very nice to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
year has been it's been very nice to
have<00:00:36.660> roles<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.100> what

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
have roles that you know so we know what

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
have roles that you know so we know what
to<00:00:38.430> expect<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:39.719> getting<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> game

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to expect when we're getting in the game

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.670 
to expect when we're getting in the game
so<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.129> prepare<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.910> possible

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
so we can prepare as much as possible

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
obviously it's still a little bit

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
obviously it's still a little bit
chaotic<00:00:44.730> down<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.829> in

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
those close games and those chaotic

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.330 
those close games and those chaotic
situations<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:49.710> referring<00:00:50.039> to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.020 
ride so far your mindset as a starter
totally<00:01:37.229> different<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> reliever<00:01:38.130> yeah

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
totally different than a reliever yeah

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.010 
totally different than a reliever yeah
it<00:01:39.180> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
it is
you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:41.000> starting<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.540> gave<00:01:42.960> me

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you know I think starting for me gave me

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010 
you know I think starting for me gave me
the<00:01:43.200> ability<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.890> develop<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the ability to develop and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.880 
the ability to develop and
what<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:46.859> of<00:01:46.890> picture<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:49.649> turned

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
what kind of picture I was and it turned

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.090 
what kind of picture I was and it turned
out<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.750> gonna<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> reliever<00:01:52.289> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
out to be I was gonna be a reliever you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
out to be I was gonna be a reliever you
know<00:01:53.219> I<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.149> approach<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
know I think that that approach and that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.649 
know I think that that approach and that
mindset<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.890> fits<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.969> way<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> like

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
mindset really fits the way that I like

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.319 
mindset really fits the way that I like
to<00:01:57.840> pitch<00:01:58.049> better<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.819> as<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> starter
