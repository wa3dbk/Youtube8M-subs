00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.909
 Hello to you channel again typeset 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 see how pawns go rush can 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.030
 walk 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 do not care about these pawns can go and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.530
 maybe so and if for example by look well 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.460
 is like for example there and will run well 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.949
 yes 1 want white for example this one 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 so like and here it is like this 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 be like if 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:46.679
 and pawns beat like pawns like this 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 both white and black and now you can through 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:01:02.429
 pawn he walks the letter r he still walks here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:11.160
 so and but if you only free servant 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:13.260
 from for example look look and pawn yes 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.990
 so it is still possible as she walks 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.300
 show again here so well, 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.730
 responsible so for example look 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.010
 Now here's the pawn began making 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.700
 tips he can beat her just 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.060
 can prevent 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.450
 well, for example, see, well , for example 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.880
 here here is this pawn is worth here and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.810
 the pawn wants to defeat the knight itself 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.810
 so it's better not to have one more 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.430
 the only one can deliver here 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.510
 for example , here we are 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:59.820
 We respect it to him and she should choose 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.700
 where to go near and only realized that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.550
 do it and even more such an option 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.250
 it turns out here because it goes 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.310
 threat to the king 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.060
 yes i will say 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.440
 but oh well, so here, too, on foot 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.680
 for example wedges pawns 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 here if the code can be extracted here 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.370
 it comes out then of course 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.880
 the queen will beat okay so we 'll take 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.380
 pawns this does not show if pawn 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:41.300
 the figure cannot stand except the queen 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:52.190
 walks everywhere she goes only right here 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:03:05.870
 so for example now you can see 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 my my king can win here but 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.600
 there are successful she will not be able to 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.790
 beat well just can not if pawn 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.709
 there is one trouble only a pawn you can 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:28.549
 to put 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:33.230
 then only he can come out 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.769
 go for example 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.049
 he was such he has become over here well, 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:45.680
 here's the king we are just about 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:48.230
 spoke and she may well see in general 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.440
 the queen walks like this and can walk 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.660
 like that in general, then Beslan 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.720
 or maybe you see the queen but the king 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.840
 because if i'm on now and if she 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.540
 beat the queen then her king will beat but 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:12.470
 we will tell about the king now see 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:18.019
 comes to us. walks only this way 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.060
 and understand the side 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.460
 you just look if we deliver 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:34.970
 point here ours then she can walk 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:41.030
 and so and so and since no 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:46.420
 interference and the king walks only if 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.420
 know how the king is where at all 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:05:01.160
 one cell cell one more rule 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.690
 see childhood like here 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.010
 the queen has become 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:11.990
 well tell me now we will show how it is 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:16.850
 for example, the elephant has become king here 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.669
 it's called us then if the king is not 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.250
 save and so it turns out well, for example 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.930
 look near stands u really stand con 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:31.100
 for example, and there is an elephant for example, but in 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.740
 Basically it's when here and so you 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.380
 shooting and if it just comes here 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.320
 on and your elephant is under the ice and rest it 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:44.800
 called mat well for example king of the court 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:48.890
 if the king can be like and if the king 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:54.400
 still here you can beat her there is no such 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.400
 can put on how to protect the king and 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:08.050
 still often the figures must always be and 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.050
 the king 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:23.240
 the game can of course options that he 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:26.289
 lose but king can walk bye 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:34.969
 he will not be mated, he will be right here 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:37.669
 stand so it is almost impossible 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.580
 is somehow different in a hundred times, I do not 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.490
 you can walk and if he does not see where 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.979
 be like or like this if there 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.870
 fits him then still beat there 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:54.349
 too will be shorter 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:58.099
 from black won 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:07:01.180
 were right how to go chess have annoyance 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.180
 whether siri bowls on credits
