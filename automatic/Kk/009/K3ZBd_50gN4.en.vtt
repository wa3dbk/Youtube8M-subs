00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.640
 laon aisne 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.230
 a somewhat unusual design is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.360
 is a kitchen that is totally 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.400
 free so we are here we are on a 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.140
 glossy white lacquer 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.100
 so the idea is really to have 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.660
 something very fluid and very pure 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.620
 we have the skin nick is totally 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.059
 integrated in the facade 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.410
 which really gives an ultra line 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.010
 contemporary and 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.010
 very learned 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.780
 for the work plan we are chosen from 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.410
 to put some piquant hearts bright white 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.789
 it really gives an ultra design side 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.949
 the advantage of quartz knows that we have a 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.379
 product that is totally anti 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.629
 bacterial totally no for them with 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.629
 180 degree resistance to heat 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.780
 he decided to put another island in 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.790
 very wide with a shelves effect we have 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.390
 a small light strip that highlights 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 the high 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 it's a little style effect 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.549
 in this implementation we decided to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.490
 to put the quotation that revolutionizes the 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.039
 way to prepare since we will have the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.689
 water point boards for 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:33.020
 preparations of the small bins that are 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:35.780
 removable it really invites a kitchen 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.549
 a little elaborate the advantage of stainless steel 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.750
 it is to have something that is 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.429
 brings professional products closer 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.429
 but also for hygiene 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.250
 we are another nice thing these two 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 little snacks that allows you to settle 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.180
 with family and friends 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.960
 we are an induction hob 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.980
 with an extensible zone the idea is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.220
 to really be able to use a 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.540
 fishmonger or casseroles oval type 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.080
 or more pans on the same area 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 in an arrangement we thought 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.320
 under the hob to integrate a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.580
 headphone so connect rather broad 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.770
 we chose to put a little oven 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.450
 more perfected than classical it is to 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.300
 to say we have one are meats to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.880
 inside and France roast peak 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.970
 inside it is completely guided 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.680
 by the oven menu and as soon as the roast 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.680
 and press stops automatically 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.580
 more of the product is that we have to 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.180
 closing which is sweet years it is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.180
 close all this 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 despite the atypical implantation of this 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.720
 cooking one might think that there is no 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.879
 storage is wrong there are many 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.739
 than in a traditional kitchen 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.129
 here we are the dedicated sliding wardrobe 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.129
 at the grocery store 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.310
 then the refrigerator that locates here 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.079
 with a more echo part one can 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.879
 find on the back of this set cabinet 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.159
 with small shelves that we 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.400
 customizes according to his wishes it is in 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.400
 well 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.140
 Oh
