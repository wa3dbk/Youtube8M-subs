00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the rubber power that it does have a lot

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
the rubber power that it does have a lot
of<00:01:06.119> strength<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.670> pull<00:01:09.240> pull<00:01:09.509> pull<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
of strength you can pull pull pull so it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
of strength you can pull pull pull so it
is<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> rubber<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> say<00:01:11.610> rubber<00:01:11.970> based

is like a rubber when I say rubber based
I'm<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.689> kidding<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.619> wept<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I'm not kidding this is a wept that I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.569 
I'm not kidding this is a wept that I
cut<00:01:14.850> completely<00:01:15.569> off<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.170> already<00:01:16.740> bulk<00:01:17.249> made

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
cut completely off and already bulk made

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.569 
cut completely off and already bulk made
weft<00:01:17.969> so<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:19.109> it's<00:01:19.409> half<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.920> size<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
weft so now it's half the size and you

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.669 
weft so now it's half the size and you
have<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> strength<00:01:21.929> it's<00:01:22.170> almost<00:01:22.469> like

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
have all the strength it's almost like

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.679 
have all the strength it's almost like
the<00:01:22.799> sealer<00:01:23.130> you've<00:01:23.310> never<00:01:23.549> had<00:01:23.999> before<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the sealer you've never had before and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
the sealer you've never had before and
you<00:01:25.109> don't<00:01:25.289> need<00:01:25.560> sealer<00:01:25.979> necessarily<00:01:26.579> with

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you don't need sealer necessarily with

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.099 
you don't need sealer necessarily with
this<00:01:26.789> because<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.179> you<00:01:27.299> make<00:01:27.479> your<00:01:27.659> bulk<00:01:27.869> hair

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
this because if you make your bulk hair

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.959 
this because if you make your bulk hair
wefts<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.670> any

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
wefts right you will not have any

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.209 
wefts right you will not have any
shedding<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.899> it's<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.469> extra<00:01:31.920> strength

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
shedding so it's just the extra strength

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.489 
shedding so it's just the extra strength
so<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:32.969> I<00:01:33.030> say<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.959> use<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
so when I say that you can use this and

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:36.230 
so when I say that you can use this and
it<00:01:34.619> turns<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> rubber<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.609> not<00:01:35.850> kidding

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it turns into a rubber I'm not kidding

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.230 
it turns into a rubber I'm not kidding
and<00:01:36.590> that's<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:37.889> hard<00:01:38.429> it<00:01:38.579> has<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.029> before

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and that's how hard it has to go before

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.679 
and that's how hard it has to go before
you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.049> hear<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
you can it's really as you can hear it

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.809 
you can it's really as you can hear it
so<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.469> see<00:01:46.529> it's<00:01:47.069> pretty<00:01:47.310> hard<00:01:47.639> to

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
so as you can see it's pretty hard to

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.239 
so as you can see it's pretty hard to
rip<00:01:47.969> apart<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.929> very<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.499> strong<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
rip apart and it's very very strong and

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.339 
rip apart and it's very very strong and
