00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.340
 Living in a host family gives a different perspective. 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.100
 I think it is a unique link with culture, 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.440
 which can not be obtained by visiting a museum 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.660
 or going to work every day. 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 It is of utmost importance. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.720
 Hospitable Families: 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.960
 For almost ten years, I have been with volunteers with my mother and my sisters. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.560
 At a young age, it was a lot of fun for me 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560
 See people in different parts of the world from our home. 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.340
 When a volunteer arrives, we try to make them feel free, 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.240
 trying to make some of our lives, 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 so that they can feel comfortable in the new environment and situation. 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360
 I remember when I got off the plane 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.460
 we went to the host family home, 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.400
 The first thing we did was drink tea. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
 I was tired of terrible flight, but from that moment on, 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.420
 I began to develop a relationship with the family. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.500
 I was worried about living with a hospitable family. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.800
 I have been living in London for a few years with a friend of mine and was very independent. 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.860
 I really did not know what to expect, 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.940
 but after the first month 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.580
 I could not imagine leaving them. 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.640
 I feel so comfortable here, 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.360
 like a family member. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 I wanted to live with a hospitable family, 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.440
 because like any other person who comes here for the first time, 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.640
 I had no idea what to expect. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.240
 I wanted to be in a place where, for example, I was free, 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.960
 I could spend time alone or communicate with my family. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.460
 I have my own room, my daily routine. 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.240
 I get up in the morning, go to work, 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.160
 meet with my friends 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.400
 I can come home and eat with my family, 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.900
 I can not eat without them if I want to. 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.760
 I have the opportunity to spend time with my family, 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720
 we go out and enjoy a happy time together 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.740
 or stay home and do something interesting. 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.940
 I can say for sure 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.780
 a good mix of personal space and family integration. 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.060
 The language was probably the most difficult obstacle for me, 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060
 but it also helped me, 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.580
 because they are asking me questions, and it helps at least to get in touch with us 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580
 and helping to make a habit of saying, "Hello, how are you?" 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.180
 Hacielio is surprised to see, 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 how volunteers change during their stay here. 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.600
 If at first we were pointing things out 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.740
 and teaching Armenian words, 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.700
 then in the end we speak with him in Armenian. 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.060
 As well as they understand the culture and people here better. 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.420
 This is a cultural exchange, 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.260
 which can not be obtained by living alone. 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.180
 I really appreciate the experience with the host family. 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.980
 What are you waiting for? 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.240
 What are you waiting for?
