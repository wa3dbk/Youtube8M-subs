00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:10.780
 Battlefield 3's real situation begins 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:17.950
 Oops 1 cut Get 1 get 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:20.789
 How is the car that be rubbed this time to the domination that have been added in closed Quarter 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.660
 And 64 people server 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.289
 Today is Alice, 64 people in Domination 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.349
 There is only a premonition of chaos 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:35.510
 So let's get Charlie right away 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:39.219
 This is a full view from above, so please clear it first 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.219
 Clearing is important, isn't it? 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.310
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 It is a pity that guy to TatsuSen in front of the large enemy 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 Hmm 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 If so, please defeat in a single shot 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:04.620
 No matter how wanted not occur also a miracle in what rounds shot I was one Oh squirrel world though it is before the eyes 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.850
 There is an Aim force that can be obtained if you make an effort 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:14.390
 I 've taken a shot field 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.340
 It is a sound that is easy to collect points because you can take the field immediately if it is domination, but the enemy side is also soon 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.720
 You have foot in his 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:25.630
 Oops grenades have disappeared 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.650
 If the flag is taken, it will not be accumulated points further with flap neutral transition flag dash 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.940
 Or 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.340
 The discovery it will rise skinny of class 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:40.310
 Clearing ok Where did you go? 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.570
 I'm hiding below I'm clearing ok Assault 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.730
 Is there an enemy in front of you and where is the clearing ok? 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.010
 ok ok I'll get back Charlie too 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:56.530
 Please clear this time properly 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.530
 I know I have no enemy shadow 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 Eeeeeee c 4 had been planted 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.770
 I because it's Domination is a narrow capture the flag range 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 We can cover with c 4 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.370
 I think c 4 is a foul at the base 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.750
 In the case of Conquest, there was nothing like this 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.750
 God is a common story 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.310
 Hello from behind 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.510
 It is mousse suppression Two nice people 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.350
 Alice started to give up 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.950
 Do not know 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.420
 I guess I'm not a squad leader 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.420
 Let's put out the target instruction 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 Next time I will go back to get Bravo down from here 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.760
 Was not 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.290
 I wonder if has come enemies that are Uchia' over there 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.950
 It is a grenade to hurt Hashimoto 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.120
 I got lost because I did not go ahead 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.360
 I have to go to Takeno Port and I have to say it's like a reconnaissance 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.040
 Charlie is attacked 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:21.380
 Because there is nothing we Wow over powerless the happened of explosives 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.630
 coo It looks like you've been so c 4 seems to be able to explode and get in the enemy 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.520
 is 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.740
 Should I give gimmick assistance soldier's more c Pau Hohou enemy 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.090
 A family girl who snipers her husband 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.090
 It was really a family thing 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.230
 Let's go to Charlie next 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.550
 I responded to you nearby 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.050
 I was looking backwards 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.500
 Was mentioned 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.500
 It 's not something to Nante knife kills in this battleground 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.069
 Again Charlie 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 oo why the scene 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.120
 Will did not come struck with what that enemy soldiers surely to Kurushima boast just got 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.109
 I wanted to 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:24.919
 For now I can only say that this is not the case 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:24.919
 I think that I have not had the opportunity to see the tap easily in front of my eyes, whether I've been over c 4 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.500
 1Killghetto I'm reloading now 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.010
 Didn't you wait until your fatigue was over? 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.010
 I have a bad attitude and a feeling like that 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.880
 The base seems to have just returned Charlie. 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.580
 I can not go 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.440
 Another one found 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.630
 Do not come not come Do not come to 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.620
 It is an ally 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.620
 Are you a tab in such an easy-to-see place or broken right away? 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.240
 I wonder if Modoroki organization's came on their own 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.400
 Ah 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:22.920
 By the way, I will recover my strength so much and let's add to Charlie's defense. 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.860
 It seems that there are enemies in the north 4 passage. 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:32.150
 I wonder if I can aim from here 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 Too many Ju shootings from the instruction'm here is pop around once 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.259
 What are you doing alone ? Kohei 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.940
 Soon there are fewer tickets 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.990
 I can not afford to die in vain 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.990
 Oh, it's coming 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:58.130
 What do you do from the side not to die in vain 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.819
 Or enemy of nothing because there is no reaction even if you press the yo w key I did not spot 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.819
 When 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.970
 I'm a mountain teaser next time I received tuberculosis resuscitation 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.970
 Ah 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.160
 Yes End team lost 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.160
 It looks like it was Las kill Thank you for your viewing It was a disgraceful end the way
