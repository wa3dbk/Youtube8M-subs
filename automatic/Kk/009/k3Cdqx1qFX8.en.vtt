00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.460
MR. HOOPER: Well, I'll
see you later, Bob.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.440
I have a little errand to do.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.880
BOB: OK, Mr. Hooper.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.885
Oh, Mr. Hooper?

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:13.475
MR. HOOPER: Yes.

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:14.725
BOB: Happy Hanukkah.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.680
MR. HOOPER: Thank you, Bob.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.070
And a merry Christmas to you.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.640
OSCAR: Merry Christmas,
merry Christmas.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.090
Huh, I hope their Christmas
trees get termites.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.760
[SINGING]

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.844
I can't think of anything
that's dumber.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.870
To a grouch, Christmas
is a bummer.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.630
Beaming faces everywhere,
happiness is in the air.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.960
I'm telling you,
it isn't fair.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.872
I hate Christmas.

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:57.740
People loaded with
goodwill, giving

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.174
presents, what a thrill.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:01.810
That slushy nonsense
makes me ill.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.650
I hate Christmas.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.440
I'd rather have a holiday
like normal Grouches do.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.510
Instead of getting presents,
they take

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.830
presents back from you.

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.090
Here comes Santa,
girls and boys.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.090
So who needs that
big, red noise?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.540
I'll tell him where
to put his toys.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.821
I hate Christmas.

00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.188
And if you want the truth,
I ain't so crazy about

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:29.600
Thanksgiving or Labor
Day either.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.710
Christmas carols to be sung,
decorations to be hung.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.152
Oh, yeah, well I stick
out my tongue.

00:01:39.152 --> 00:01:40.402
I hate Christmas.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.220
Christmas bells play loud and
strong, hurts my ears

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.730
all that ding dong.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.290
Besides, it goes on
much too long.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.240
I hate Christmas.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.586
I'd rather have a holiday with a
lot less joy and flash, with

00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:07.890
a lot of less cheerful
smiling, and a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.580
lot more dirty trash.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.074
Yeah!

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:12.544
Christmas day is almost here.

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:14.520
When it's over, then I cheer.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.990
I'm glad it's only
once a year.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.240
I hate Christmas!
