00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.700
 the simplest devices for 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.500
 making gaskets and just around 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 from almost any material 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 soft enough this is a regular mock 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.109
 knife and originally so far 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.800
 since the mock-up on the same it was not already 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.320
 appeared thirty or forty years ago were 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 ordinary knives knife called a jamb in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 which uniform bevel on one of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 sides can be cut quite well 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.309
 any of the gaskets but as soon as 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 the number of masonry pairs increases then 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.100
 accordingly, problems grow 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 making the simplest fixture 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 our replacement was 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.789
 and naturally the easiest cutting is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.030
 there was a piece of pipe was on a lathe 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.899
 about accurate and sharpened bevel depending 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 of which side of the product 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 you needed a good cut quality in this 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 side and pumped 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 thin gum thin correctly thin 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 blade side of the notch and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.659
 sharpen it was possible both on the outside 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 side and on the inside naturally 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.580
 with increasing volumes sharp or 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.909
 changing material properties even such 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
 seemingly handy tools 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.799
 demanded re-equipment especially when 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.320
 hand diameter increase 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 punching the largest diameter 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.490
 which I saw it most likely for 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.930
 cutting the shaped perforation common paper 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 perimeter larger than 25 centimeters 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.060
 but it will be possible to look at 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.189
 site and so 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.320
 main mines mines for medium and 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.390
 large diameters in those days were 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.950
 punching called ballerinka and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.619
 this is not a cutting just a tool 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 tool with originally inserted 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.259
 just in the collar pre on 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.860
 the billet was marked holes drilled 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.650
 Auxerre pierced 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.140
 yes inserted the center of the cutting 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.960
 tool and turn to gate 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.180
 billet cut and act 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.180
 as often require not just 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.280
 round cut out washer and ring something 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.170
 cutter respectively us on the tool 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.480
 there were two one of them a cuts in 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:39.690
 inner diameter 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:42.190
 and the other outdoor dancers themselves 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.000
 were originally made were the most 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.110
 primitive 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.480
 to make it easy and affordable to make 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.570
 when I ran into this same problem in 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.630
 we were faced with the task of making 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.320
 about 3000 pads of paronite 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.570
 small enough diameter 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.500
 inner diameter was 20 millimeters a 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.930
 outside about 30 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 when we ordered from factory usually 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.860
 impact type leakage of two halves 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.400
 inner part 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.170
 diameter was taken out and outwardly then at 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.420
 ask for a brush to sleep start edge 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.680
 there is no dependence 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.170
 that the instrument burned out and 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.000
 it was obvious that if 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.450
 tool from good enough 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.590
 letting go then with a permanent job he 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.959
 will even sit down on the press which we 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.670
 later already got hold of and started hacking on 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.220
 press sq performance is so 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.640
 small that these three thousand could 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.000
 chop down 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.950
 month and maybe even more so 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.660
 the simplest insofar as we 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.900
 there was a drilling machine we did 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.480
 ballerina 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.100
 round of the usual washers which were 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.720
 holes are drilled but this again 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.720
 can be seen on the site 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.350
 the following device is the same 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.300
 ballerina only with rattle 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.450
 the only thing she has under 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.820
 already appeared resistant rack attached 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.430
 directly to the stove from her entered 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.190
 bracket and ballerinka on one side 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.060
 one side was inserted into the hole a 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.970
 the second end stubborn rested against 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.360
 support bar with a small feed 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.590
 ballerinas manually 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:39.450
 screw mental screw feed 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.450
 incisors hit and cut a gasket 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.460
 ballerinas also available well not very 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.470
 it took a long time for ballerinas to become 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.050
 do for machine tools 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.100
 and not only for manual insofar 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.530
 since it was necessary to manually 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.020
 high labor intensity directly 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:06.240
 manual labor before her time took 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:10.270
 quite a lot as you grow 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.930
 technical equipment usual knife 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.370
 rice from steel to change to roller that it 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.640
 gave it gave 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.870
 durability knives which increase in 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.790
 several times this is the first leg itself 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.260
 roller just enough to sharpen 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.520
 insofar as it is symmetrical and 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.620
 grinding it does not represent any 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.380
 of complexity it is enough just to paste on 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.419
 the mandrel whereas the hand legs need 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:44.770
 long enough to output but also like 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.919
 ordinary ballerinas, too, began to put them 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.250
 on the machine 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.470
 whether the first specialized machine 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.860
 there were machines for cutting gaskets 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.290
 which have not been put on 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.390
 machine tools with what it is connected 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.780
 this is your machine is quite expensive 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.169
 equipment and its simple does not pay off 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.800
 on production so machine tools became 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.910
 build universal ones that could 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.260
 to put on 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.160
 on the desktop and if the simplest 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.230
 had a flywheel for rotation and either 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.630
 ring knife or several knives for 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.320
 cutting gaskets then further 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.940
 improvement went even further and already 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.570
 appeared directly clamp 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.570
 blanks in order not to rotate 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:46.780
 the inner part which founded which 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:50.170
 stays inside the gasket also 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.840
 there were zik roller machines for 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.970
 circle cuts respectively cut at 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.590
 they can not only circle and if 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.620
 install more than one pair of knives 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:04.060
 How much can they cut in one circle? 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.580
 completely laying but general principle 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.880
 almost unchanged applied 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.660
 either a knife as a cutting tool 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.660
 either a roller knife which I do the same 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.580
 cuts the very workpiece only 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.390
 the limitation here is persistence 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.390
 tool when
