like<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> said<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.140> try<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> put<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.159> hair

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
like I said I try to put on my hair

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
like I said I try to put on my hair
without<00:01:56.430> bleaching<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.299> didn't<00:01:57.719> work<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.170> i

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
without bleaching it didn't work so i

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.429 
without bleaching it didn't work so i
had<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> bleach<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> first<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.490> then<00:01:59.520> do<00:02:00.000> this

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
had to bleach it first and then do this

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
had to bleach it first and then do this
it's<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.740> simple<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.189> do<00:02:02.570> basically<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.750> your

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it's so simple to do basically get your

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's so simple to do basically get your
white<00:02:04.049> conditioner<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.759> white

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
white conditioner it has to be white

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.809 
white conditioner it has to be white
because<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.320> any<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.590> color<00:02:07.979> when

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
because if you get any other color when

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.690 
because if you get any other color when
you<00:02:08.970> mix<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.259> color<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:11.310> gonna<00:02:11.489> go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you mix it with your color it's gonna go

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.530 
you mix it with your color it's gonna go
funny

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
