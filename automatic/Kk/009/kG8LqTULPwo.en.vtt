00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.310
 the cards 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.560
 because they do not pay part time as much as they can detect everything that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.540
 they have already borrowed 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.670
 they are indebted because they use it as if it were extra money and only pay the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.130
 minimum 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.410

 because you will be in myself they will start charging interest on what 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.159
