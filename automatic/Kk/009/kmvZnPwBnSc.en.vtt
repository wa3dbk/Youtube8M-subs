skin<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> absorbs<00:01:17.610> through<00:01:17.939> their<00:01:18.150> body<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
skin and absorbs through their body and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.499 
skin and absorbs through their body and
you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.490> sure<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> 11<00:01:21.270> inches

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you want to make sure this is 11 inches

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
you want to make sure this is 11 inches
I<00:01:21.930> thought<00:01:22.110> you'd<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.560> 13<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.400> had<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> go

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I thought you'd be like 13 I had to go

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
I thought you'd be like 13 I had to go
back<00:01:24.150> twice<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> make<00:01:25.500> sure<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
back twice so you want to make sure that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
back twice so you want to make sure that
the<00:01:26.009> necklace<00:01:26.340> itself<00:01:26.909> can't<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.630> above<00:01:28.080> their

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
the necklace itself can't go above their
chin<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:28.979> can't<00:01:29.220> fight<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
chin so they can't fight it you want to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.929 
chin so they can't fight it you want to
keep<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.930> tight<00:01:31.140> enough<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.820> won't

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
keep it tight enough that that won't

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
keep it tight enough that that won't
happen<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.810> obviously<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.350> too<00:01:34.530> tight<00:01:34.740> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.160 
I think this one's five dollars cheaper
about<00:02:14.409> 25<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:15.040> about<00:02:15.219> 20<00:02:15.689> he<00:02:16.689> likes<00:02:16.870> them<00:02:17.049> both

about 25 in about 20 he likes them both

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.050 
about 25 in about 20 he likes them both

with<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.519> thing<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.000> apparently<00:02:49.239> it's

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
with this thing and apparently it's

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.020 
with this thing and apparently it's
really<00:02:49.599> hard<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.049> clean<00:02:50.459> food<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.639> I<00:02:51.790> haven't

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
really hard to clean food and I haven't

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.520 
really hard to clean food and I haven't
put<00:02:52.150> food<00:02:52.299> in<00:02:52.480> there<00:02:52.629> yet<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.230> put<00:02:53.379> ice

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
put food in there yet and I just put ice

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.729 
put food in there yet and I just put ice
but<00:02:53.949> the<00:02:54.040> ice<00:02:54.159> seems<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.639> you<00:02:55.419> know<00:02:55.510> work

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
but the ice seems to you know work

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.589 
but the ice seems to you know work
reasonably<00:02:56.739> well<00:02:56.859> for<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.430> son<00:02:57.669> he<00:02:58.000> does<00:02:58.180> kind

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
reasonably well for my son he does kind

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.449 
reasonably well for my son he does kind
of<00:02:58.659> like<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.590> that's<00:02:59.680> another<00:02:59.949> option<00:03:00.370> out

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
of like it so that's another option out

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.550 
of like it so that's another option out
there<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.730> think<00:03:00.849> again<00:03:01.389> this<00:03:01.569> was<00:03:01.719> under<00:03:01.959> $7

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
there I think again this was under $7

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.409 
there I think again this was under $7
and<00:03:02.799> they<00:03:02.859> just<00:03:03.010> hold<00:03:03.159> it<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:04.269> there

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
and they just hold it like so so there

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.509 
and they just hold it like so so there
you<00:03:04.510> go<00:03:04.629> guys<00:03:04.659> another<00:03:05.199> quick<00:03:05.439> scan<00:03:05.739> those<00:03:06.370> the
