00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.039
 it is the hardest it is more complicated 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.410
 he has this confidence 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:13.450
 independent of holy faith will be the guild 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.450
 but we have our thing 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.720
 yes 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.050
 as he passed the cup the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.840
 responsibilities are greater we are of 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.270
 the best eight I think if we want 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.220
 get between the four we have to 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.470
 keep doing perfect match not us 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.629
 we can make mistakes we know the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.800
 consequences that brings about there ok but 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.540
 almost there we have to prepare ourselves as 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.449
 the best way is being done but 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.180
 take care of the final part keep 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.670
 the sky is important if it is true that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.790
 if always in each game is important 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.170
 secure zero now in all 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.090
 matches whether it's now more important 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.149
 because he has only two parties and he does not know 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.360
 You can then flinching 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.850
 I think that to this day 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.180
 we have done good work in all 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.860
 matches 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.480
 but as I tell you 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.610
 responsibilities are greater as 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.830
 that is going through phases if they want 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 enter between the four we have to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.880
 try to continue making a match 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.520
 perfect that we do not play the address 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.010
 they said it was not anxiety that's going to 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 be very important this vital issue that 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.450
 concerns the margin of the red team to the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.860
 margin of the cardinal team is guiding 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.140
 Brazilian wade really what 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 in this in this last game that 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.190
 move the cup I think there were many 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.260
 habitual failures that complicated to always 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.420
 complicates when you take into account the 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.080
 center that complicated towards matches 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.250
 thanks for clear English I think there 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.620
 to set aside must be left 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.410
 calm of the referee doing work 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.120
 God illuminate it illuminate God by 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.740
 about all things to the referee for 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.930
 that can make the best decision is 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.130
 important also because it refers to 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.830
 level of garcilaso 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.369
 international when sometimes they do not take 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.900
 hand of consideration the press of Peru 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.450
 for what 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.420
 it's called congratulations and so 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.520
 we are doing with the club in all 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.850
 the countries that I've been playing 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.460
 I think you vargas and thanks to you made a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.860
 impressive jump at club level 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.560
 was recognized in just three years 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.930
 today this question by actually 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.690
 only people already know it and well we have 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.510
 done things very important but there's no 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.430
 forget what we are left to 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.840
 margin of everything that can be said and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.050
 good 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.900
 We have 33 days today, Monday, Tuesday and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.989
 Wednesday to be able to arrive for 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.780
 finish and get to the truth that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.500
 us on cross is nothing without your 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.879
 fanaticada and nascent novenas we want 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.580
 that is full on the radio 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.010
 we want visitors to come to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.769
 warner cusco feel what is coming to 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.260
 keep in the cusco I do not know what and that is 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.959
 the team that comes to play from the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.480
 point of the day that you catch of Cusco you have 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.180
 to feel that comes from visiting the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.700
 address and what's next so that if you do not 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.810
 put the head to do a job I think 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.310
 that takes in the lost match 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.310
 thank you very much and good luck
