00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
boil it up the Rings as you're supposed

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.089 
boil it up the Rings as you're supposed
to<00:03:49.700> do<00:03:49.939> when<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.439> assemble<00:03:51.439> it<00:03:51.680> onto<00:03:52.010> the

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
to do when you assemble it onto the

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.690 
zero 20 and the bottom is point 0 24 we
Wasco<00:04:08.450> recommends<00:04:08.959> 19<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.620> 23<00:04:09.980> but<00:04:10.430> we<00:04:10.549> did

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
Wasco recommends 19 and 23 but we did

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.089 
Wasco recommends 19 and 23 but we did
point<00:04:10.970> 1<00:04:11.150> greater<00:04:11.480> because<00:04:11.989> I'm<00:04:12.829> gonna<00:04:13.010> be

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
point 1 greater because I'm gonna be

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.530 
point 1 greater because I'm gonna be
making<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.459> little<00:04:13.639> more<00:04:13.819> power<00:04:14.030> than<00:04:14.329> what<00:04:14.510> I

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
making a little more power than what I

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.749 
making a little more power than what I
think<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.940> factory<00:04:17.359> spec<00:04:17.660> should<00:04:17.840> be<00:04:17.989> set<00:04:18.199> at

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
think the factory spec should be set at

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.050 
think the factory spec should be set at
I<00:04:19.759> have<00:04:21.130> not<00:04:22.130> gonna<00:04:22.310> take<00:04:22.460> them<00:04:22.580> out<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:22.970> I

Brad Penn it's really good oil sae ther
already<00:04:38.389> break-in<00:04:38.780> oil<00:04:38.889> oil<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:39.979> actually

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
already break-in oil oil is actually

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.770 
already break-in oil oil is actually
green<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.789> didn't<00:04:41.150> know<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:41.539> I<00:04:41.599> bought<00:04:41.840> it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
block that I blow up a huge hole this is

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.860 
block that I blow up a huge hole this is
the<00:06:06.289> front<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.830> motor<00:06:07.009> I<00:06:07.130> believe<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.870> it

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
the front of the motor I believe and it

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.560 
the front of the motor I believe and it
actually<00:06:09.350> blew<00:06:09.620> a<00:06:09.650> hole<00:06:09.919> in<00:06:10.310> the<00:06:11.150> back<00:06:11.330> of<00:06:11.509> the

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
actually blew a hole in the back of the

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.469 
actually blew a hole in the back of the
motor<00:06:11.750> that<00:06:12.070> looks<00:06:13.070> like<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.669> exact<00:06:14.030> piston

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
motor that looks like the exact piston

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.710 
motor that looks like the exact piston
size<00:06:14.740> but<00:06:15.940> wasn't<00:06:16.940> pretty<00:06:17.270> you<00:06:17.360> want<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:17.539> blow

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
size but wasn't pretty you want to blow

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:27.330 
size but wasn't pretty you want to blow
up<00:06:22.090> valve<00:06:23.090> cover

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.710 

so<00:06:34.770> transmission<00:06:36.000> was<00:06:37.000> trying<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.360> clean<00:06:37.570> it

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
so transmission was trying to clean it

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.050 
so transmission was trying to clean it
up<00:06:37.840> but<00:06:37.990> I<00:06:38.080> got<00:06:38.199> cold<00:06:38.520> tried<00:06:39.520> making<00:06:39.669> a<00:06:39.820> little

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
on it all the damage that my motor did

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.810 
on it all the damage that my motor did
that<00:07:21.160> ruined<00:07:21.639> things<00:07:22.830> pretty<00:07:23.830> much<00:07:23.889> just

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:24.820 
that ruined things pretty much just

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.820 
that ruined things pretty much just
destroyed<00:07:25.300> it<00:07:26.370> sucks

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830

we'll<00:07:29.460> cover<00:07:30.680> and<00:07:31.680> just<00:07:31.830> bolts<00:07:32.190> all<00:07:32.340> over<00:07:32.580> the

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
we'll cover and just bolts all over the

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:37.399 
we'll cover and just bolts all over the
place<00:07:32.879> and<00:07:33.120> then<00:07:33.270> also<00:07:33.620> back<00:07:34.620> here<00:07:36.139> all<00:07:37.139> the

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:37.409 
place and then also back here all the

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.070 
place and then also back here all the
way<00:07:37.470> back<00:07:37.650> there<00:07:37.889> it<00:07:38.009> actually<00:07:38.310> goes<00:07:38.490> tile<00:07:39.860> gas

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 
way back there it actually goes tile gas

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.719 
way back there it actually goes tile gas
so<00:07:43.080> I<00:07:43.620> guess<00:07:44.099> I'll<00:07:44.220> give<00:07:44.340> you<00:07:44.430> guys<00:07:44.550> an<00:07:44.669> update

so I guess I'll give you guys an update
when<00:07:45.090> I<00:07:45.120> get<00:07:45.330> it<00:07:45.389> back<00:07:45.449> together<00:07:45.690> should<00:07:46.020> be

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
when I get it back together should be

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.770 
when I get it back together should be
back<00:07:46.259> together<00:07:46.819> really<00:07:47.819> soon<00:07:48.180> I<00:07:48.360> have<00:07:48.539> pretty

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 
back together really soon I have pretty

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 
- little bolts and nuts so hopefully it

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.949 
- little bolts and nuts so hopefully it
comes<00:07:55.169> back<00:07:55.319> together<00:07:55.560> real<00:07:55.919> soon
