rotten angle you're on the far hash mark
and<00:00:10.800> you're<00:00:11.309> also<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.820> close<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.570> when<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
and you're also in close so when the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
ball is in the 16 and you're kicking

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
ball is in the 16 and you're kicking
this<00:00:15.809> field<00:00:16.049> goal<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> worst

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
this field goal that is about the worst

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
this field goal that is about the worst
place<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.850> farther<00:00:18.570> back<00:00:18.840> would<00:00:19.109> probably

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
place to be farther back would probably

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.070 
place to be farther back would probably
be<00:00:19.439> easier<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.189> Landry<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.119> case<00:00:21.359> but

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
be easier for Landry in this case but

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.509 
be easier for Landry in this case but
you're<00:00:22.199> lined<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> Michigan<00:00:23.310> bench

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you're lined up and the Michigan bench

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.609 
you're lined up and the Michigan bench
is<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:24.180> behind<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.260> they<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.590> see

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
is right behind you so they can all see

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.339 
is right behind you so they can all see
this<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.189> back<00:00:26.400> then<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.449> uprights<00:00:28.080> were<00:00:28.170> not

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349

this now back then the uprights were not
that<00:00:28.529> high<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.160> Michael<00:00:29.760> Andrew<00:00:30.029> forced

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that high I think Michael Andrew forced

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
that high I think Michael Andrew forced
them<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.779> increase<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.619> distance<00:00:32.219> because

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
them to increase the distance because

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.430 
them to increase the distance because
they<00:00:32.759> couldn't<00:00:32.969> tell<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.930> had<00:00:34.020> happened

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
they couldn't tell what had happened

they couldn't tell what had happened
they<00:00:35.280> line<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:36.420> kick<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> kick

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
they line it up they kick the kick

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
same thing that that kick was good he

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
same thing that that kick was good he
probably<00:01:26.909> missed<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> 58<00:01:28.020> eight<00:01:28.259> yarder<00:01:28.680> by<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
probably missed the 58 eight yarder by a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.260 
probably missed the 58 eight yarder by a
few<00:01:29.009> inches<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.340> probably<00:01:29.549> missed<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> 44

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
few inches he probably missed a 44

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.640 
few inches he probably missed a 44
yarder<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.810> 33<00:01:31.619> yard<00:01:31.770> kick<00:01:31.979> he<00:01:32.430> made<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
yarder that 33 yard kick he made it and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.069 
yarder that 33 yard kick he made it and
think<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.360> refs<00:01:36.630> made<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think about this if the refs made what I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
think about this if the refs made what I
think<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.500> probably<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:37.979> call<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
think was probably the right call and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.760 
think was probably the right call and
you<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> kick<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you make that kick you're not this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.950 
you make that kick you're not this
