00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 there are night owls and early risers 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
 when the revelers whose still 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.680
 deeply others already benefit from 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.420
 the first tide of freshness 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 early morning to start a day 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.099
 no doubt full of activities on the port 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 from brusc to six ovens in the esther var 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.920
 lefebvre david bordier and dominique 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 palce it is necessary that the deans 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.560
 conscientious 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.550
 if two friends are at work since 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 a very long time ago 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.769
 it's 8 o'clock and like every morning 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.510
 here meets the little circle of upsets 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.830
 early 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.180
 Well, it's the bike to go fishing for everything 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.710
 because anyway after you 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.360
 request on the water we can not go to 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 too much space and early fishermen 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.489
 almost as their customers most 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.240
 greedy people are used to it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.750
 come from happiness 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.920
 it's disgusting unconscious best of 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.230
 come early in the morning 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.460
 there are more choices and then as I 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.799
 come by bike for sportsmen the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.540
 sleep just forbidden 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.250
 it's a very hot case today 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 so I get up early to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 cover the teens conference to a quarter 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.030
 of race time before coming to do 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.100
 plunge a little head into the bag 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.250
 nice but the beach even at 9 o'clock 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.190
 and it's not necessarily easy 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.740
 but not there because we have buses on 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:38.340
 most beautiful castle of the joke 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:46.369
 every time children are accused of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.369
 pull their parents out of bed with navarro 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.799
 but for grandparents it's a 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.259
 pleasure to live in shifted around 10:30 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.570
 kids bah yes because after we are 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.659
 submerged soon overwhelmed by the tide 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.149
 vacationers and the heat wave 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.390
 on this beach 35 degrees expected this 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.390
 afternoon then so
