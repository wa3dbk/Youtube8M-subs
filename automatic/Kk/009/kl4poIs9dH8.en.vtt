a solution to this pretty much what you

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.980 
a solution to this pretty much what you
is<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.720> will<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.920> way<00:00:23.810> stays<00:00:24.810> open

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
is you will just see this way stays open

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.570 
is you will just see this way stays open
for<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.260> lot<00:00:25.439> longer<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:26.460> go

of explain it as we go so you don't have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
of explain it as we go so you don't have
quite<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.219> few<00:00:38.280> repeaters<00:00:38.790> depending<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.180> how

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
quite a few repeaters depending on how

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
quite a few repeaters depending on how
much<00:00:39.390> should<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:40.200> much<00:00:40.350> longer<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
much should how much longer you want the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
much should how much longer you want the
button<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> stay<00:00:41.940> after<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.270> poor<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
button to stay after a poor then it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.600 
button to stay after a poor then it
doesn't<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.710> fryin<00:00:44.100> door<00:00:44.340> like

doesn't have to be fryin door like
that's<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.210> example<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.800> uh<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.600> have<00:00:48.600> one

that's just an example but uh I have one

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
that's just an example but uh I have one
repeater<00:00:49.079> than<00:00:49.620> an<00:00:49.739> increasing<00:00:50.190> number<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
repeater than an increasing number of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
repeater than an increasing number of
repeaters<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.719> I'm<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.530> gonna

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
repeaters going that way I'm just gonna

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700 
repeaters going that way I'm just gonna
do<00:00:53.129> let's<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.410> let<00:00:55.410> me<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
do let's see you for let me go up to

do let's see you for let me go up to
four<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.879> connect<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> them

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
four you want to connect all of them

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.439 
four you want to connect all of them
along<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> bottom<00:00:58.379> row<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.180> then<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
along the bottom row and then all of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.729 
along the bottom row and then all of
them<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:02.719> make<00:01:03.719> sure<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> it's

them going that way make sure that it's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
them going that way make sure that it's
connected<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> deck<00:01:06.260> make<00:01:07.260> sure<00:01:07.290> it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
connected on the deck make sure it's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
connected on the deck make sure it's
connected<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> diagonals<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
connected on the diagonals and not just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.140 
connected on the diagonals and not just
like<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> got<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> connect<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
like I just like that got to connect it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.640 
like I just like that got to connect it
completely<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.100> then<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.430> pretty<00:01:14.640> much

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
completely and then so pretty much

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.350 
completely and then so pretty much
powering<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.490> line<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
powering this line right here is the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
powering this line right here is the
input<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> power<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
input so like if you power this it's the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.999 
input so like if you power this it's the
input<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.320> output<00:01:25.439> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
input and back here is the output so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
input and back here is the output so
let's<00:01:26.189> try<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.479> well<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> door<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
let's try this well have a door here and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.550 
let's try this well have a door here and
a<00:01:30.470> button<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> pretty<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.500> we

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
a button here so pretty much when we

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
a button here so pretty much when we
press<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> button<00:01:35.070> oh<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.820> nevermind<00:01:36.150> up

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
press the button oh I know nevermind up

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.649 
press the button oh I know nevermind up
for<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> part<00:01:36.630> um<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> have

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for a part um this is gonna have to have

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
for a part um this is gonna have to have
no<00:01:40.320> repeats<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.460> everything

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
no repeats on it and then everything

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
else just set it to maximum hit

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.770 
else just set it to maximum hit
everything<00:01:43.860> else<00:01:44.100> three<00:01:44.549> times<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.490 
in the throw you want it to have nothing
because<00:01:53.140> if<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.409> make<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.710> have<00:01:54.330> maximum<00:01:55.500> then

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
because if you make it have maximum then

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620 
because if you make it have maximum then
it'll<00:01:56.830> like<00:01:57.250> take<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.909> second<00:01:58.299> for<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.420> door<00:01:58.600> to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
it'll like take a second for the door to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.749 
it'll like take a second for the door to
open<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:59.200> mean<00:01:59.950> or<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.369> could<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.520> have

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
open I mean or you could just have

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.430 
open I mean or you could just have
nothing<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.900> door<00:02:02.080> will<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.320> open

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
nothing and the door will just open

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.210 
nothing and the door will just open
instantly<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:05.380> how<00:02:05.500> long<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.830> door<00:02:05.979> stays

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
instantly see how long the door stays

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.449 
instantly see how long the door stays
open<00:02:06.369> for<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:08.229> because<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:09.039> power<00:02:09.250> this

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
open for that's because you power this

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.000 
open for that's because you power this
and<00:02:09.850> then<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.300> powers<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.630> output<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.830> then

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
and then it powers the output and then

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.800 
and then it powers the output and then
by<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.160> time<00:02:12.250> that's<00:02:12.580> done<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.270> wyd<00:02:13.660> is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
by the time that's done this wyd is

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.360 
by the time that's done this wyd is
powering<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.260> output<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:15.100> by<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.280> time

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
powering the output then by the time

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.860 
powering the output then by the time
that's<00:02:15.640> done<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:15.970> line<00:02:16.209> starts<00:02:16.510> powering

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
that's done this line starts powering

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.660 
that's done this line starts powering
output<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.739> by<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:17.980> time<00:02:18.069> that's<00:02:18.370> done<00:02:18.520> this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
output then by the time that's done this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.550 
output then by the time that's done this
plan<00:02:18.880> starts<00:02:19.209> counting<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> output<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.440> this

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
plan starts counting the output so this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
plan starts counting the output so this
one<00:02:20.709> powers<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.820> one<00:02:21.880> powers

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
one powers it and then this one powers

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.210 
one powers it and then this one powers
it<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.170> powers<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.040> then

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it and then this one powers it and then

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.910 
it and then this one powers it and then
this<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.459> power<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:26.110> yeah<00:02:26.290> pretty<00:02:26.530> much<00:02:26.620> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
this one power so yeah pretty much it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.340 
this one power so yeah pretty much it
yeah<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.180> getting<00:02:28.269> powered<00:02:28.720> four

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
yeah it's like it's getting powered four

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.770 
yeah it's like it's getting powered four
times<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.580> actually<00:02:30.700> feature<00:02:31.420> these<00:02:31.660> is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
times so it's actually feature these is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.300 
times so it's actually feature these is
a<00:02:31.810> millisecond<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.500> four<00:02:32.739> milliseconds<00:02:32.950> for

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
a millisecond so four milliseconds for

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.420 
a millisecond so four milliseconds for
nonsense<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.880> like<00:02:34.060> 1.2<00:02:34.630> seconds<00:02:35.430> something

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
nonsense is like 1.2 seconds something

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.100 
nonsense is like 1.2 seconds something
sense<00:02:37.920> maybe<00:02:38.920> maybe<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.850> don't<00:02:40.060> know<00:02:40.120> i<00:02:40.360> don't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
sense maybe maybe I don't know i don't

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.780 
sense maybe maybe I don't know i don't
know<00:02:41.290> i'm<00:02:41.650> not<00:02:41.739> i'm<00:02:41.980> not<00:02:42.010> good<00:02:42.280> counter<00:02:42.640> in

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
know i'm not i'm not good counter in

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.630 
know i'm not i'm not good counter in
legitimate<00:02:43.090> seconds<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:44.069> um<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.340> only<00:02:45.430> way

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
legitimate seconds but um the only way

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.820 
legitimate seconds but um the only way
uh<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.989> yeah<00:02:47.110> pretty<00:02:47.290> much<00:02:47.350> that's<00:02:47.680> how<00:02:47.739> you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
uh so yeah pretty much that's how you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.350 
uh so yeah pretty much that's how you
make<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> door<00:02:48.340> stay<00:02:48.640> open<00:02:48.880> for<00:02:49.000> longer<00:02:49.239> it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
make the door stay open for longer it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.430 
make the door stay open for longer it
doesn't<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.810> be<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.930> door<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.350> be<00:02:50.410> a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
doesn't have to be a door it can be a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.080 
doesn't have to be a door it can be a
piston<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.069> can<00:02:51.190> eat<00:02:51.340> anything<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.209> are<00:02:52.440> like

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
piston it can eat anything you are like

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.020 
piston it can eat anything you are like
seriously<00:02:55.090> yeah<00:02:55.269> whatever<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.660> want<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.489> just

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
seriously yeah whatever you want so just

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.569 
seriously yeah whatever you want so just
once<00:02:58.810> again<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.110> know<00:02:59.230> have<00:03:00.190> their<00:03:00.340> Peter's

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
once again you know have their Peter's

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.600 
once again you know have their Peter's
going<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.970> an<00:03:01.360> upwards<00:03:01.750> motion<00:03:02.400> control<00:03:03.400> on

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
going in an upwards motion control on

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.590 
going in an upwards motion control on
the<00:03:03.730> bottom<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.450> top<00:03:05.250> connect<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:07.030> side

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
the bottom on the top connect this side

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.479 
the bottom on the top connect this side
to<00:03:07.780> your<00:03:07.870> output<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.680> side<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.070> your<00:03:09.190> input

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
to your output this side to your input

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.979 
to your output this side to your input
doesn't<00:03:10.090> matter<00:03:10.329> how<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.510> get<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> your

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
doesn't matter how you get it to your

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.210 
doesn't matter how you get it to your
input<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.350> could<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:11.590> connected<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.010> over

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
input you could have connected it over

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.550 
input you could have connected it over
here<00:03:12.459> can<00:03:13.360> connect<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.720> over<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.380> doesn't

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
here can connect it over here it doesn't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.860 
here can connect it over here it doesn't
matter<00:03:14.799> i<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.910> chose<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.090> connect<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.690> on

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
matter i just chose to connect it on

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.380 
matter i just chose to connect it on
this<00:03:17.079> piece<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:18.430> simply<00:03:18.790> because<00:03:19.030> i<00:03:19.180> wanted

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
this piece just simply because i wanted

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.590 
this piece just simply because i wanted
two<00:03:19.510> closest<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.019> door<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.209> then<00:03:22.359> see<00:03:22.540> how

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
two closest to the door and then see how

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.660 
two closest to the door and then see how
long<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.810> door<00:03:22.959> stays<00:03:23.170> open<00:03:23.340> versus<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:24.489> one

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
long the door stays open versus this one

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.270 
long the door stays open versus this one
has<00:03:24.790> three<00:03:25.120> lines<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:29.260> bit<00:03:29.350> slower<00:03:29.620> and

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
has three lines little bit slower and

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.920 
has three lines little bit slower and
then<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:30.940> one<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.209> has<00:03:31.359> nothing<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:31.900> a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
then this one just has nothing is just a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.220 
then this one just has nothing is just a
normal<00:03:32.350> door<00:03:32.590> time<00:03:32.799> horrible<00:03:33.489> um<00:03:34.269> so

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
normal door time horrible um so

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.650 
normal door time horrible um so
yeah<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:36.070> not<00:03:36.220> super<00:03:36.700> compact<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.510> mean

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
yeah it is not super compact but I mean

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.020 
yeah it is not super compact but I mean
it's<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.260> best<00:03:38.500> version<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.579> can<00:03:39.850> figure

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
it's the best version that I can figure

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.819 
it's the best version that I can figure
out<00:03:40.150> right<00:03:40.420> now<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.900> don't<00:03:41.320> know<00:03:41.530> if<00:03:41.560> there<00:03:41.739> is

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829
