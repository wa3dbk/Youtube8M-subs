00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.219
 hi I am arianna borraccino of the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 greeted toy library today I will show you 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.439
 of decoration jobs with the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.119
 sand to make at home to make the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:29.910
 our job is sand 1 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:35.010
 run a bowl of shells a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 saucer of the colored tempera of the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 brushes and glue in this case 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.510
 we will use a wooden tag from 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.579
 decorate with our colored sand 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.930
 first let's refine the sand 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.920
 collected from the sea 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.920
 let's take a ladle 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.420
 and the feline we stretch making it finer 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.450
 some of our fine sand there 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 we leave here to use after another 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 we begin to color it we take ours 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.430
 tempera I chose the yellow color 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.430
 we put some in our saucer 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.370
 let's take our colored sand 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.740
 and with a brush we begin to mix 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.900
 to make it dry once colored 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.900
 we spread it on a little piece of paper 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.620
 first we glue our own 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.370
 shells collected collected from the sea 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.370
 with some vinyl glue 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.710
 then we cover ours 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.710
 glue plate 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.990
 once the whole plate is covered 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.470
 of glue with your hands to fill it 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.470
 with the sand 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.240
 remember to remove the excess 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.250
 shaking the plate once 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.420
 covered the whole plate with the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.820
 sand 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.590
 take the back of a brush e 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.590
 we write pleasure a name 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.540
 once engraved the name on yours 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 I wrote in this case 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.470
 sea ​​we take our sand back 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.940
 yellow colored 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.020
 I have prepared with the same technique 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.020
 another colors 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.170
 let's take up the glue and a brush 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.829
 small and we are going to fill ours 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.829
 engraving 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.990
 take a color of your choice of yellow 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.670
 and we spread it carefully on the entire 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.670
 glue 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.239
 don't worry if it comes out of the edges 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.530
 because once he has shaken he will remain 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.530
 only where the glue is 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.980
 now that we're done filling up 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.760
 all the letters with our sand 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.800
 colored we remove the excess for 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.870
 sensitize your children to use 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.880
 of hands and tactile sensitivity 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.340
 I advise you to do all the 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.000
 coloring and refinement procedures 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.500
 nature of sand with hands 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.270
 this technique applicable to any 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.990
 type of object 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.630
 I made another plate one 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.630
 frame or a ceiling light
