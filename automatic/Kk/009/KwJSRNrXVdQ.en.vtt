00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.050
 welcome is here god of war presents 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.910
 his fourth installment and sony santa monica 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.890
 it reminds us again because it is one of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.170
 the most valued studies of the moment 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.910
 the Spartan is in top form and 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.610
 star in a prequel that no fan 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.380
 of the saga you can lose ascension not 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.420
 it's just an epic journey to learn more 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.130
 of its protagonist but that is also 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.600
 a perfect opportunity to return to 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.220
 immerse ourselves in one of the best 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.640
 franchises hack and slash of the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.640
 history 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.559
 if you are a regular in the god of series 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.239
 words surely you know the 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.649
 story of creators but what will you 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.300
 catch by surprise is that in this 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.579
 on occasion they are going to tell us everything 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.559
 it happened six months before the original game 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.750
 the idea was to discover a side something 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.269
 more human of the protagonist although between 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.799
 so much carnage is something difficult to 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.780
 done we would have liked it had 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.070
 developed more the script however 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.930
 It must be said that as the engine of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.970
 experience perfectly serves for the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.720
 hero's journey along the way we will suffer 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.789
 tricks 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.530
 we will live spectacular scenes and 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.940
 we will face some super villains 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.390
 we will put things very 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.390
 difficult 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 in story mode we will take something 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.180
 more than 10 hours to overcome it and is 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.550
 composed of 30 chapters that take us 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 by very different locations you can 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.000
 that the surprise factor of the epic and the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.070
 giant decorations the god of war 3 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.630
 have disappeared but the pace 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.580
 exciting and the presence of many 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 puzzles and sections of platforms 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.970
 they make the set of the new game 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.970
 remain very attractive 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.830
 and it is that of course what we are going to do 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.450
 in ascension is to fight and there it is 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.520
 difficult to do things better than 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.619
 behind the world of war and the precision of 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.869
 maneuvers is amazing and difficult 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.610
 not feel powerful with all the weapons 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.590
 and spells with which kratos counts 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.690
 besides the title has a curve of 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.670
 perfect learning by adding little to 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.380
 little news and offering at the end 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.880
 a wide range of alternatives 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.880
 with which to massacre our rivals 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.830
 to each direction of the crosshead we 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.630
 allows access to a type of weapon and the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.849
 combination with the triggers releases 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.680
 magic in the blink of an eye and 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.030
 almost without realizing we are going to 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.250
 Simultaneousize a lot of styles 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.349
 different and adapt to each enemy 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.550
 with what more damage does beauty 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.340
 of the dance of death starring 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.840
 by kratos is indisputable and some of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.800
 the biggest enemies will be a 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.800
 authentic challenge 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.150
 the improvements are fundamental and in this 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.010
 meaning the title again offers the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.749
 same system for magic health or 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.730
 progress that we have always seen in the 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.409
 series with the red orbs we get 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.749
 experience points that we will invest 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.939
 in improving our weapons and spells with 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:01.439
 the blues reload witchcraft and with 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.439
 the greens get life 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.970
 therefore the unlocks and the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 Obtaining new weapons are key to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.510
 move forward and if we want to opt for 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.340
 difficult difficulty or why you 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.989
 Unlock when you finish, it's better 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.910
 have explored the world thoroughly and have 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.769
 given with all the artifacts and advances 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.610
 for creators since the challenge is going to 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.610
 be uppercase 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.530
 but it's not all about killing in 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.970
 ascension for example the puzzles we 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.739
 they are going to do it would give the coconut from time to time 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.870
 when and some of them have a 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.370
 witty point very nice almost 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.170
 they always consist of mechanisms that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.150
 we have to operate or in parts of the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.190
 scenario that we have to rebuild and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.780
 although they are never too complex if 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.780
 they offer alternative fun 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.180
 the parts of platforms are also 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.310
 there and kratos is again a true 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.290
 acrobat are not very sections 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.030
 challenging and some like those of the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.189
 descents by slopes are repeated to 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.629
 often without contributing too much but all 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.239
 they take place in environments 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.859
 wonderful and that also counts in addition 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.689
 when all these scenes are 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.549
 simultanean with the action ones they take what 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.329
 best of us and they are really 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.329
 challenging 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.250
 one of the great novelties of 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.500
 Ascension is the debut of the multiplayer 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.660
 in the god of war saga in these cases 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.730
 any added sum and therefore it is 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.540
 Welcome especially when you offer 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.540
 so many contents 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.020
 we will not incarnate kratos in the part 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.150
 online but there is a good handful of 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.130
 cooperative and competitive modalities 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.050
 which are quite interesting for 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.210
 This fight between Spartans and Trojans 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.949
 it's about half a dozen alternatives 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.020
 very classic for a maximum of 8 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.880
 players and where topics like the 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.260
 Flag capture or death match 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.260
 by teams among others 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.250
 the proposal is not bad and it is 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.050
 cool thanks to body combat 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.880
 body and together with the different 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.520
 deities but it is clear that the great 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.510
 attractiveness of god of war ascension is its 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.510
 individual campaign 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.060
 from the visual point of view there is little 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.070
 to reproach the new adventure of 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.530
 kratos the epic path that opened the 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.090
 third part is even more marked and 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.500
 It costs a lot not to keep your mouth 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.210
 open to some of the scenarios 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.210
 that we will kick in ascension 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.120
 work on what data and its 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.950
 enemies offers the same conclusions 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.290
 awesome modeling very animations 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.290
 natural and an outstanding set 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.890
 if we could put some snags 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.600
 we would be inclined by the lack of 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.580
 interaction with very scenarios 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.380
 rigid however it costs to give 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.760
 too much importance to that when 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.700
 we have a set with an illumination 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.700
 such a resounding fluidity and finish 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.099
 as for the audio there is also very 

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:00.649
 good news the music is so 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.419
 majestic as the context demands and is 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.739
 also produced as expected from 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.689
 a sound work 

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:07.069
 the effects are bloody as the action 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.709
 although it has to be said that very 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.029
 sporadically they fail or do not sound 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:13.129
 finish the game comes to our country 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.819
 doubled with a good level but not 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:15.819
 memorable 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.330
 mercy on behalf of Ares in a year 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.069
 extraordinary for the genre hack and 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.199
 slash ascension is another proposal 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.270
 great to put in the mouth the 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.099
 multiplayer far from bothering is a 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.900
 interesting addition but the campaign 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.340
 is again the great protagonist of a 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.949
 very generous title in terms of 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.020
 contained thus the new god of war 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.750
 It is bloody but also very fun and 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.319
 fully recommendable releases kratos from 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.319
 its chains
