 a challenge sun 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.660
 one of the editors removed the fantasy in one of his speeches 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.429
 they had an exchange of words before the intervention of rich neither in 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.709
 the general assembly of united nations in 1987 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.970
 it is not a fashion and camps there is a note from the editor that says his honor in this 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.800
 his speech take a look and comment m ignore 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 had eliminated all reference to the alien invasion 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.160
 the president responded with a handwritten note 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.060
 at the end with the letter of regan there is a fragment that says there is too much 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.630
 anti-Soviet material time I want to get away from this by the way afterwards 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.130
 recover my fantasy about how the world would come together if I had to 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.330
 face creatures from another planet 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.450
 accepting the president's decision 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.540
 dobson retouched the speech and during the general assembly of united nations the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 September 21, 1987 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.540
 river said 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.880
 although a new rumor has been going on for months 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.250
 with them 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.710
 and we went growth and in swat 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.920
 with paul south solet 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.000
 one day tasks that I 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 although his name the impulse we would see month 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.090
 president I for his part prevailed 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.120
 1989 1993 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.460
 the researchers insist that the bus driver 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 is the key to the current knowledge of UFOs 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.420
 I suppose your father is one of the key presidents in regards to 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.820
 one tour 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.870
 is an important figure because many researchers consider him aware of 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.570
 what is happening 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.300
 he was director of the company with the president forged in five years of president with 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.790
 Ronaldo Ligan for eight years never informed the president of many issues 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.039
 including a few males and looking for the army trusted him 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.790
 also the intelligence services of the knicks in fact there is a building 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.769
 from the headquarters of the cia called york is a konex cultural city 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.260
 was approved to compose 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 or in the bag herbert walter bush started being director of the subsidiary it 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.439
 introduces some believe that he should have some knowledge of what was 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.609
 occurring in the agency dpa in the field a zoo coatepec 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.609
 I'm there jensen 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:35.939
 present year 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.090
 if it were like that 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 it may not be revealed until long after you leave like the others 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.250
 presidents spoiled the country the background dawn people will write science and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.450
 he probably did it when he was there then the center of baghdad sent 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.170
 requests for information about alien material in their possession 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.759
 three times more than 900 pages 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.019
 aware 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.230
 they were told that they no longer dealt with this issue but to win 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 Americans was going to accept or not and that affirmation 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.989
 however there is hardly any evidence linking President Bush with the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.289
 UFOs 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:16.399
 when I wrote the library-museum dismissed convents of the UFOs I 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.809
 they said they only had one 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.589
 there are no public documents that relate to put easy with UFOs 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.319
 but no researcher has doubts is that this man was doing a lot 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.319
 on the matter 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.639
 the answer may be in some heavily censored documents 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.639
 declassified by some military agencies 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.240
 for many users 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.289
 flowers some members of his cabinet included 15 in the dollar per bushel 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.719
 they were the ones who kept jealously cut the files inside 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.959
 the military and intelligence circles 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.109
 the future you know a lot about what is happening in this secret world 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.619
 some like the world behind the presidency 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.289
 the world of real power and wealth 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.440
 he is a man in the shadow 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.680
 the one who has the oil money and the right contacts if they want to know 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.200
 what is happening this 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
 The bush will be man 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.830
 the president clinton 1993 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.830
 2001 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.889
 the presidential archives of a fake clinton bill contain 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.830
 records related to men 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.070
 so he closed his lap 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.070
 to supposed close encounters 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:53.549
 some would be used would say that if the UFOs were those of Carter clinton is the 

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:55.810
 colored ladder 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.240
 he knew how to understand it 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 81 it is said that the clinton have a lot of windows in the library of the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.580
 This was broken by his brown-haired Carlos who wanted to prove that he was a 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.599
 open administration 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.759
 picheto a gold mine for a researcher Luis Angel 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.639
 mccollum annually good number of operations clinton did more than 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.830
 no other president of ford is classifying secret material I have eight 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.659
 opponent did more to disclose government information 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.710
 than any other president to date eight to district councils 

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:31.830
 another president who openly declared his interest in the bishops 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.579
 banks and he was not afraid to talk about it in public as 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.129
 and goes spoke of social security not only that came to win in his 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.509
 habitual logo of the pubis autism or ceasefire and the whole village is lived 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.210
 are its functions 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.650
 they are conservatives who talked about social security the president has 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.539
 repeated his jokes about the UFOs 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.719
 he did it eight times 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.699
 but many researchers believe that the clinton white house was shown 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.269
 comprehensive with the need to declassify UFO records 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.599
 perhaps the most impressive comment by clinton on the subject was made during a 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.599
 speech on November 30, 1995 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.870
 a presidential speech is not something that always at ease that his men 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.919
 something that takes days and weeks later have been reviewed by all the 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:22.200
 world 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.390
 for example that they include a presidential speech is there for a reason 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.200
 his clinton debut was delivering a peace speech to 80 thousand people 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.580
 in belfast northern ireland was talking about children have 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.449
 if you are in the audience today this is the answer to your question 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.000
 assign this scene by relief market scene notice 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.479
 the intention to carry the money 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.719
 will have credited agbonlahor 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.610
 lawyer from that is the part that the Swedish media issued 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.509
 in the second part there is a clear challenge addressed to the army is an old 8 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.090
 marc pelosi recovered the alien bodies did not tell me anything either
