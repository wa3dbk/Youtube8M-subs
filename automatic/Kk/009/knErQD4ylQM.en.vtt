coast of that is tremendous you have

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.140 
coast of that is tremendous you have
loads<00:03:10.270> of<00:03:10.720> options<00:03:11.610> when<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.700> go<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.850> build

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
loads of options when you go to build

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.020 
loads of options when you go to build
them<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.780> let<00:03:14.410> me<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.800> if<00:03:14.860> any<00:03:15.070> toaster

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.030 

right<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.110> coaster<00:03:20.710> designs
