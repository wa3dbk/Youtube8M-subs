 quietly when it occurs to him to do 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.170
 a matrix and look here he applied that 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.970
 illusion better known as the illusion 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.980

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.930
 annihilation and good then the latter 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.360
 Granada managed to make its deadly 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.009
 but they managed to kill him or more than 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.240
 nothing the grenade also made it 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.160

 he managed to make her a girl some kind 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.100
 that came from the blue team and well then 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.050
 a Maya who was also going to give him a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.090
 hit and then he also put it straight 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 for your girl and how can you not see and there 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.980
 ends his epic in number 6 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.480
 and it arrives in uvi in ​​number 5 here we see 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.010
 it's going to be a sniper streak 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.510
 excellent and really liked it enough 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.609
 here we see that he starts making a 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.019
 double and later meets with 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.459
 the other enemies but in the end he managed 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.379
 kill him from this guy who was jumping 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.700
 out there then a second ago no 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.680
 looked and we see that he already did in his 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.209
 bus and well, in the distance they are 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
 the enemies answering in the part of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.109
 back then he gets to do his 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.030
 excellent annihilation we see that celebrates 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.230
 even but good later on it gives 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.030
 notice that the enemies are still 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.920
 appearing in the back here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.359
 we see that there are partners that with a frenzy 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.849
 killer get a triple 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.230
 crown and at the end with a cachazo of the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.049
 fury it was known to see that extermination 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.209
 there we see that it is recharged and they are healed 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.669
 and then once that streak nothing 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.560
 the more you get a relentless streak of 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.419
 the hyper then manages to make a girl 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.549
 excellent and a bus to finalize 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.030
 your super emery pro clips for the number 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.030
 five 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.280
 and we have Saul at number 3 where 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.840
 here he starts throwing a grenade and 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.220
 Well, the guy who apparently does not know 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.959
 he saw how he got it but he got there 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.480

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.370
 he did a murder he liked quite this 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.349
 murder where he made his everything that he already 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.569
 that he did evading and let's say it's 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.549
 a kind of ninja although there is no 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.260
 jumped but well here we see how the 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.840
 enemies were down the stairs do 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.459
 his march that excellent with evasion and not 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.500
 I know if he says so but because so and 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.780
 final makes a ninja with her cute tribe and 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.430
 there is his epic in at number 4 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.050
 and we start with the section of the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.000
 best ninjas and matrix and we have 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.560
 first to sonic where is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.319
 running here with the pistol of the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.700
 Fury decides to look for the enemies here 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.260
 we see that he is already fighting a guy who 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.300
 he managed to kill him and back one comes with the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.980
 sword that is going to be a matrix here 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.810
 and going up the stairs and got 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.940
 kill this guy who was going to get him 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.830
 with the sword and good here in the second 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.350
 clip we have both 76 where is 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.790
 doing parkour on this map you get a 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.680
 little of the map but in the end he got 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.910
 stabilize in this part and good nothing 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.800
 more is a matter of waiting for the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.360
 enemies I see a green guy who is 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.970
 going up then it makes a matrix 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.290
 excellent from that part of the super map 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.820
 try and see how the enemy 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.830
 firstly it is going up then 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.080
 he gets to do his murder of fury 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.570
 jumping and then there in the end celebrates 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.640
 now we have to confess where does a 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.140
 excellent matrix murder a 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.790
 second matrix to the guy who was going out there and 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.770
 good then the useless and they wanted to apply 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.690
 this type of team orange a kind 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 of weird machaque but in the end he got 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.740
 defend with a club tribe and good at 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.960
 this time we have here and here where 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.180
 is therefore doing a murder from the 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.800
 tower as they saw managed to jump and this 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.960
 kind that was going technically 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.710
 defending the shield made him his 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.690
 murder 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.790
 and we see how he is jumping around 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.110
 and finally ended up dead there in the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.090
 good soil at the end a guy was 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.830
 invisible and finally we do not have here 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.200
 speed where is with the hammer equal 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.510
 is very high on the map then decide 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.310
 make a 900 degree murder here with 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.960

 as they saw he first made a shot of 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.090
 sniper to the head of this guy 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.190

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.630
 a little streak here on the hill that 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.060

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.920
 kind of death with very pro sniper 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.960
 but well here we see that he makes his shake 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.310
 to this guy who was also running a 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.260
 A little later, he waits for the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.910
 enemies if they set change the hill 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.710

 then keep moving forward grab the 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.360
 m &amp; r and well, the hill changes 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.220
 of position wildly then 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.660

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.930
 and for the fanta bull bear number one 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.390
 arrives from sendai here and here we see that 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.520
 it is technically without 9 without shields 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.260
 he has very low health then he decides 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.150
 hide who is the teleporter 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.160
 but to his surprise he was shot with 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.710
 an invisible sniper bullet apparently 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.660
 or who knows it may have been a bug 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.430
 a hack or something like that but not 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.990
 here's the answer this guy that 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.790
 I was aiming this guy got 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.530
 give him for the teleporter and good 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.570
 He also told him about the betrayal 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.940
 before he got into stl because there 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.440
 he finishes his guata fac and that has been all 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.030
