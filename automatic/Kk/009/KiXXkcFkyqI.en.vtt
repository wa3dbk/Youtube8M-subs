00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
my classes I keep this with me so this

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.240 
my classes I keep this with me so this
is<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.490> really<00:05:31.729> nice<00:05:31.910> case<00:05:32.650> so<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.950> know<00:05:34.070> it

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250

the<00:05:39.760> this<00:05:40.760> matte<00:05:41.390> finish<00:05:41.930> is<00:05:42.140> really<00:05:42.490> likely

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
the this matte finish is really likely

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.680 
the this matte finish is really likely
to<00:05:44.060> get<00:05:44.900> scratched<00:05:45.440> and<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.880> worst<00:05:47.240> part<00:05:47.540> is

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
to get scratched and the worst part is

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.360 
to get scratched and the worst part is
once<00:05:48.410> it's<00:05:48.620> scratch<00:05:49.310> just<00:05:50.240> scratched<00:05:51.370> scratch

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
once it's scratch just scratched scratch

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.659 
once it's scratch just scratched scratch
is<00:05:52.700> really<00:05:53.270> damn<00:05:53.660> prominent<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:55.070> you<00:05:55.460> might
