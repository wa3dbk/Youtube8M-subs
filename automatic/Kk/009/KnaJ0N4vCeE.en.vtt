00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 in appearance it is the usual lada granta true 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.950
 if you are in the cabin rushes in 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.200
 eyes 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.780
 gear lever it's not 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.300
 machines not mechanics on a grant hybrid 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.969
 installed a robotic box for 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.250
 This version of auto robot fits most 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 total grant now with hybrid power 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 setting 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 passes the last test in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.779
 compliance labs 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.470
 toxicity is by the way euro 5 and for 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.119
 The Euro 6 standard is not a problem either. 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 the car is available 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.020
 internal combustion engine and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.140
 power installation all major 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 the purpose of creating such a car 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 achieved 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 the government has set before us 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.410
 objectives to reduce co2 emissions so that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.219
 the car matches the perspective 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.079
 Euro-6 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.270
 throw away and reduce fuel consumption 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.110
 In this case, gasoline and at least 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 21 percent here at the moment 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.500
 we pass 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.410
 road test acceptance test 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 factory tests ie 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.280
 approximately we can say that these 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 indicators we have reached 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.170
 fuel savings of more than 21 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 a percentage of the features of this car 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.869
 It is necessary to provide an internal 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.540
 combustion 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.460
 he is also not exactly a typical engine 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 works in conjunction with the installation 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.009
 turbocharging is practically the first experience 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 on the introduction of a turbocharged engine on 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 serial version of domestic 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.030
 car and not only AvtoVAZ 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 but across the country target figure 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 which was installed for this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 engine is power 120 kilo watt 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.270
 by 5 600 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 and the moment is 240 nobody per meters for turbo 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.760
 engine and maximum torque already 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.430
 starts at 2000 rpm and allows 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.030
 consumer use car 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.610
 let's say in the whole range 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.650
 turnover worth noting that turbo 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.619
 the engine is able to develop power to 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.600
 160 horsepower however hybrid 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.820
 car will also use 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 conventional engines do not like 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.319
 too much auto power and no desire 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.720
 pay increased transport tax 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.530
 this is fine with the usual serial 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.530
 VAZ engine
