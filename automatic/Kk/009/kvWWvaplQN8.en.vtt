hi my name is rich we recently had the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.660 
hi my name is rich we recently had the
microwave<00:00:03.480> oven<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:03.929> our<00:00:04.310> motorhome<00:00:05.310> break

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
microwave oven in our motorhome break

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.839 
microwave oven in our motorhome break
the<00:00:06.830> turntable<00:00:07.830> quit<00:00:08.069> working<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:08.610> just

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the turntable quit working I was just

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.520 
the turntable quit working I was just
hard<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> cook<00:00:09.389> anything<00:00:09.690> correctly<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.440> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
hard to cook anything correctly in the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.400 
hard to cook anything correctly in the
microwave<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.010> way<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.450> did<00:00:13.170> some

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
microwave that way so I did some

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.680 
microwave that way so I did some
researching<00:00:14.040> online<00:00:14.219> because<00:00:14.910> my<00:00:15.450> initial

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
researching online because my initial

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.540 
researching online because my initial
thought<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> looked<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.430> was

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
thought was that it looked like I was

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070 
thought was that it looked like I was
going<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> pull<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.480> microwave

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
going to have to pull out the microwave

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.939 
going to have to pull out the microwave
convection<00:00:20.010> oven<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.320> throw<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> away<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
convection oven and throw it away and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
convection oven and throw it away and
replace<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.539> cabinetry<00:00:25.170> that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
replace all the cabinetry that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.160 
replace all the cabinetry that
surrounded<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.039> thing<00:00:26.449> just<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
surrounded that thing just because you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
surrounded that thing just because you
think<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.619> something<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> microwave<00:00:29.970> oven

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
think of something like a microwave oven

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.939 
think of something like a microwave oven
as<00:00:30.390> being<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.750> disposable<00:00:31.320> they're<00:00:31.710> so

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
as being just disposable they're so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.459 
as being just disposable they're so
cheap<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.460> buy<00:00:32.640> why<00:00:33.510> did<00:00:33.809> some<00:00:34.050> searching

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
cheap to buy why did some searching

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.170 
cheap to buy why did some searching
around<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.860> YouTube<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.460> found<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.760> couple<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
around on YouTube and found a couple of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.380 
around on YouTube and found a couple of
other<00:00:36.649> brands<00:00:37.649> where<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.579> fix<00:00:38.879> was<00:00:39.120> pretty

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
other brands where the fix was pretty

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
other brands where the fix was pretty
easy<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.670> microwaves<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
easy but they are all microwaves that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.299 
easy but they are all microwaves that
were<00:00:42.059> countertops<00:00:42.930> ours<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
were countertops ours is actually a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.610 
were countertops ours is actually a
built<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.940> over<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.809> range<00:00:46.050> microwave<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
built in over the range microwave and so

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.799 
built in over the range microwave and so
it<00:00:49.620> turns<00:00:49.920> out<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.000> might<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:51.510> be

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it turns out that it might even be

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.439 
it turns out that it might even be
easier<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.320> fix<00:00:52.530> though<00:00:52.829> over<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.699> range<00:00:54.120> one

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
easier to fix though over the range one

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
easier to fix though over the range one
then<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.219> countertop<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.059> hope

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
then it would be the countertop I hope

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.080 
then it would be the countertop I hope
