00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
cobblestone generator and that I guess

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.050 
cobblestone generator and that I guess
that<00:02:34.590> makes<00:02:34.769> sense<00:02:34.890> because<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.760> next<00:02:35.910> thing

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that makes sense because the next thing

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.000 
that makes sense because the next thing
to<00:02:36.269> do<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.420> build<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.810> house<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.860> need

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
to do is build a house so we need

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.940 
to do is build a house so we need
waiting<00:02:38.940> cheats<00:02:39.330> no<00:02:40.260> no<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
waiting cheats no no this is the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.610 
waiting cheats no no this is the
challenge<00:02:41.870> there's<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.930> list<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.349> 20

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
challenge there's a list of 20

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.949 
challenge there's a list of 20
challenges<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.250> then<00:02:44.420> optional<00:02:45.420> challenges

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
challenges and then optional challenges

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.890 
challenges and then optional challenges
for<00:02:46.519> advanced<00:02:47.519> players<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.250> um<00:02:51.209> all<00:02:51.510> right<00:02:51.660> get

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
for advanced players so um all right get

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.120 
for advanced players so um all right get
to<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.200> start<00:02:52.470> making<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.769> cobblestone

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
to it start making a cobblestone

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.610
