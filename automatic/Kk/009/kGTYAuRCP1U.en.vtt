00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
the review series I'm Tim good to be

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580 
the review series I'm Tim good to be
technical<00:00:11.639> director<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.180> and<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.559> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
technical director here and this is a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.480 
technical director here and this is a
review<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.010> the<00:00:14.190> abus<00:00:14.940> hardened<00:00:15.570> steel<00:00:15.750> chains

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
review of the abus hardened steel chains

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
review of the abus hardened steel chains
now<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.640> important<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> note<00:00:18.360> that<00:00:18.390> with

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
now it's important to note that with

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.030 
now it's important to note that with
chains<00:00:19.850> they<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:21.869> all<00:00:22.110> made<00:00:22.410> equal

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
chains they are not all made equal

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.250 
chains they are not all made equal
many<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.820> lower-cost<00:00:24.480> versions<00:00:25.020> are<00:00:25.230> not

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
many of the lower-cost versions are not

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.540 
many of the lower-cost versions are not
made<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.620> hardened<00:00:26.010> steel<00:00:26.280> and<00:00:28.550> certainly

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
made from hardened steel and certainly

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.910 
made from hardened steel and certainly
the<00:00:29.760> steel<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.420> graded

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
the steel will not be graded

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.440 
the steel will not be graded
abus<00:00:31.920> grades<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.460> steel<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.059> called<00:00:33.329> be

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
abus grades it's steel so it's called be

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.720 
abus grades it's steel so it's called be
controlled<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.829> when<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
controlled so that when you get a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.750 
controlled so that when you get a
hardened<00:00:36.180> steel<00:00:36.390> chain<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.920> top

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
hardened steel chain it really is of top

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.489 
hardened steel chain it really is of top
quality<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.449> graded<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.109> that<00:00:40.199> it's<00:00:40.320> very

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:40.499 
quality and graded so that it's very

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:46.639 
quality and graded so that it's very
hard<00:00:40.769> to<00:00:40.980> cut<00:00:41.249> and<00:00:42.320> saw<00:00:43.819> so<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.289> chain<00:00:46.530> as

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
hard to cut and saw so the the chain as

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.729 
hard to cut and saw so the the chain as
a<00:00:46.679> whole<00:00:46.920> has<00:00:47.909> a<00:00:47.940> number<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.589> hardened<00:00:49.589> steel

to<00:00:57.449> say<00:00:57.749> about<00:00:58.309> chains<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.569> is<00:01:00.659> very

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to say about chains but what is very

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.209 
to say about chains but what is very
important<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.409> note<00:01:01.589> in<00:01:01.679> a<00:01:01.739> common<00:01:02.069> question

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
important to note in a common question

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.430 
important to note in a common question
we<00:01:02.429> get<00:01:02.639> people<00:01:03.210> say<00:01:03.479> oh<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.659> can't<00:01:03.989> put<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> chain

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
we get people say oh I can't put a chain

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.990 
we get people say oh I can't put a chain
on<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:04.620> padlock<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> cloche<00:01:05.640> Akal

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
on my padlock because it's a cloche Akal

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
on my padlock because it's a cloche Akal
type<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> can't<00:01:06.720> fit<00:01:06.930> both<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.950> links

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
type and I can't fit both the links

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.560 
type and I can't fit both the links
through<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> padlock<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.290> decent<00:01:10.920> chain

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
through the padlock now any decent chain

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.470 
through the padlock now any decent chain
will<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.720> designed<00:01:13.230> with<00:01:13.620> one<00:01:14.550> link<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
will be designed with one link at the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.680 
will be designed with one link at the
end<00:01:15.980> larger<00:01:16.980> than<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> other<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.390> sign

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
end larger than the other this is a sign

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.060 
end larger than the other this is a sign
of<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.900> good<00:01:19.020> chain<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> security

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
of a good chain if you have a security

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.860 
of a good chain if you have a security
chain<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.420> it's

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
chain and it's not like this it's

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.840 
chain and it's not like this it's
probably<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.740> sign<00:01:22.980> that<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.370> cheap<00:01:23.640> one

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
probably a sign that it was a cheap one

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.950 
probably a sign that it was a cheap one
or<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.410> good<00:01:25.620> quality<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> he's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
or have not two good quality so and he's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.980 
or have not two good quality so and he's
designed<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:29.160> you<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.150> smaller<00:01:30.750> loop

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
designed that you take the smaller loop

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.130 
designed that you take the smaller loop
pop<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.980> through<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.730> larger<00:01:33.150> loop<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.720> then

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pop it through the larger loop and then

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.640 
pop it through the larger loop and then
I'll<00:01:34.230> demonstrate<00:01:34.470> using<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:36.230> granite<00:01:37.230> padlock

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
I'll demonstrate using a granite padlock

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
I'll demonstrate using a granite padlock
here<00:01:38.660> if<00:01:39.660> you<00:01:39.870> slide<00:01:40.620> that<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:43.080> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
here if you slide that on there and you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
here if you slide that on there and you
can<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:43.980> that<00:01:44.340> clearly<00:01:44.880> there's<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.480> room

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
can see now that clearly there's no room

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.830 
can see now that clearly there's no room
to<00:01:45.810> fit<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.500> chain<00:01:47.460> links<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.940> there<00:01:48.150> but<00:01:48.630> one

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
to fit two chain links in there but one

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.930 
to fit two chain links in there but one
will<00:01:49.050> certainly<00:01:49.500> fit<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.700> on

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
will certainly fit and with that on

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.000 
will certainly fit and with that on
there's<00:01:51.480> not<00:01:51.630> an<00:01:51.780> awful<00:01:51.900> lot<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> room<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.710> get

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
there's not an awful lot of room to get

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.530 
there's not an awful lot of room to get
any<00:01:53.190> bolt<00:01:53.400> cutters<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.910> there<00:01:54.120> so<00:01:54.330> they<00:01:54.450> would

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
any bolt cutters in there so they would

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.420 
any bolt cutters in there so they would
have<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> chain<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:55.980> again<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
have to go for the chain which again is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.900 
have to go for the chain which again is
hardened<00:01:56.790> steel<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:58.190> very<00:01:59.190> difficult<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.700> cut

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
hardened steel and very difficult to cut

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.410 
hardened steel and very difficult to cut
so<00:02:00.300> that's<00:02:00.510> how<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.900> decent<00:02:01.320> chain<00:02:01.560> works<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so that's how a decent chain works and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.370 
so that's how a decent chain works and
that's<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.690> abus<00:02:04.380> range<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.130> change
