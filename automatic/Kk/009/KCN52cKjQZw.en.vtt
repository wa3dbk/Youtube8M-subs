00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.250
 following 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.510
 suddenly there was no call 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.340
 it must be completed 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.290

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 so if I'm stuck on the marble 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.940
 it's a nice cup challenge 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.840
 remember that before the coup 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.270
 far very far 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 as part of the dispatch 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.560
 spreading for example 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 the tarn of the lot 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 maybe not so I'm not crying 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.029

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.489
 vedanta not put out 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.939
 and what is not normal 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.289

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.219

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.389
