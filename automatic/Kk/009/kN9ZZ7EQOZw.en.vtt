fourths which is a really great exercise
and<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:11.350> know<00:02:11.410> maybe<00:02:11.620> taken<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:12.640> cycles

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and you know maybe taken you know cycles

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.009 
and you know maybe taken you know cycles
or<00:02:13.120> thirds<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.600> know<00:02:13.690> maybe<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.050> triplets<00:02:14.620> and

all right so we kind of ended up in the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.509 
all right so we kind of ended up in the
key<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:17.870> F<00:04:18.049> major<00:04:18.079> there<00:04:18.650> kind<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.250> where<00:04:19.400> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
key of F major there kind of where the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.960 
key of F major there kind of where the
licks<00:04:19.760> started<00:04:20.540> taking<00:04:20.989> me<00:04:21.109> so<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:21.889> just
