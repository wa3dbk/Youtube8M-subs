worry about throwing out stuff that's
gonna<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.300> wasted<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.660> know<00:03:21.810> stuff<00:03:22.050> I'm<00:03:22.170> not

gonna be wasted you know stuff I'm not

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.960 
gonna be wasted you know stuff I'm not
going<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.470> eat<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.580> just<00:03:23.730> another

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
going to eat so this is just another

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.590 
going to eat so this is just another
another<00:03:24.690> option<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:25.950> your<00:03:26.040> kit<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.450> make

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
another option for your kit to to make

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.630 
another option for your kit to to make
things<00:03:27.690> more<00:03:27.900> versatile<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:29.040> again<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.489> is

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
things more versatile so again this is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.670 
things more versatile so again this is
just<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.910> 72<00:03:30.300> hour<00:03:30.330> emergency<00:03:30.870> meal<00:03:31.230> kit<00:03:31.470> I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
just a 72 hour emergency meal kit I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.080 
just a 72 hour emergency meal kit I
think<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.489> someone<00:03:32.820> who<00:03:32.910> wants

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
think that if you're someone who wants

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.270 
think that if you're someone who wants
to<00:03:33.150> stock<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> little<00:03:33.750> bit<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.930> food<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
to stock a little bit of food but you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.560 
to stock a little bit of food but you
don't<00:03:35.430> want<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:35.790> extreme<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.330> don't<00:03:36.450> want

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
don't want to go extreme you don't want

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.820 
don't want to go extreme you don't want
to<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.720> crazy<00:03:36.959> with<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> could

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
to be crazy with it you know I could

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.110 
to be crazy with it you know I could
spend<00:03:38.070> hundreds<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.550> hundreds<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.850> dollars

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.870 
spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars
on<00:03:39.239> food<00:03:39.830> this<00:03:40.830> might<00:03:41.010> be<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> very<00:03:41.250> good<00:03:41.580> option

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
on food this might be a very good option

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.060 
on food this might be a very good option
for<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.300> like<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.080> said<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.410> not<00:03:43.530> food<00:03:43.739> for<00:03:43.769> an

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
for you like I said it's not food for an

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.130 
for you like I said it's not food for an
adult<00:03:44.310> for<00:03:44.519> three<00:03:44.730> days<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.570> eat<00:03:45.690> comfortably

adult for three days to eat comfortably

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.750 
adult for three days to eat comfortably
you<00:03:46.709> could<00:03:46.860> stretch<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.220> out<00:03:47.340> even<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.640> little

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you could stretch this out even a little

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.310 
you could stretch this out even a little
bit<00:03:47.910> more<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.570> comfortable<00:03:49.080> eating

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
bit more this is just comfortable eating

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.030 
bit more this is just comfortable eating
like<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> regular<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.670> know<00:03:50.700> mealtime<00:03:51.239> stuff

like a regular you know mealtime stuff
as<00:03:53.040> far<00:03:53.100> as<00:03:53.310> lifespan<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.620> noticed<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.769> box

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
as far as lifespan I noticed in the box

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.840 
as far as lifespan I noticed in the box
here<00:03:56.269> this<00:03:57.269> one<00:03:57.680> says<00:03:58.680> it's<00:03:59.810> best<00:04:00.810> used<00:04:01.080> by

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
here this one says it's best used by

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.229 
here this one says it's best used by
2016<00:04:02.850> or<00:04:03.090> April<00:04:03.660> 2016<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> they<00:04:05.670> don't<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:05.970> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
2016 or April 2016 so they don't have a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.210 
2016 or April 2016 so they don't have a
lifespan<00:04:06.959> as<00:04:07.290> long<00:04:07.530> as<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.220> cans<00:04:08.660> but<00:04:10.220> you

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
lifespan as long as the the cans but you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.350 
lifespan as long as the the cans but you
know<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.459> something<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.790> think<00:04:11.820> about<00:04:12.120> there

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
know just something to think about there

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.280 
know just something to think about there
and<00:04:12.720> there<00:04:12.870> are<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.989> little<00:04:13.080> bit<00:04:13.260> more

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
and there are a little bit more

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.140 
and there are a little bit more
expensive<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:14.010> general<00:04:14.160> because<00:04:14.940> they<00:04:15.030> are

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
expensive in general because they are

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.820 
expensive in general because they are
individually<00:04:15.570> packed<00:04:15.810> it's<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.620> anything

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
individually packed it's like anything

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.380 
individually packed it's like anything
else<00:04:16.950> in<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.190> world<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.850> buy<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.180> bulk

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
else in the world if you buy in bulk

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.640 
else in the world if you buy in bulk
you're<00:04:18.600> gonna<00:04:18.720> end<00:04:18.930> up<00:04:18.989> getting<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.350> cheaper

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
you're gonna end up getting a cheaper

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.650 
you're gonna end up getting a cheaper
price<00:04:19.830> on<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:20.669> we<00:04:20.760> don't<00:04:20.880> always<00:04:21.150> need

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
price on it but we don't always need

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.870 
price on it but we don't always need
something<00:04:22.020> in<00:04:22.229> bulk<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.160> long<00:04:23.370> term<00:04:23.580> you

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
something in bulk and in a long term you

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.430 
something in bulk and in a long term you
might<00:04:24.000> end<00:04:24.150> up<00:04:24.180> wasting<00:04:24.539> food<00:04:24.750> by<00:04:25.050> doing<00:04:25.289> that

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
might end up wasting food by doing that

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.050 
might end up wasting food by doing that
so<00:04:26.250> anyway<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.580> want<00:04:26.789> to<00:04:26.850> show<00:04:26.910> you
