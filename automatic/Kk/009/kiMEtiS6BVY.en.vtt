00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.330 
will break this wax I've had no problems
with<00:02:51.730> we've<00:02:52.090> been<00:02:52.299> testing<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:53.920> over<00:02:54.310> a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
with we've been testing it for over a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.699 
with we've been testing it for over a
year<00:02:54.489> maybe<00:02:55.120> even<00:02:55.269> two<00:02:55.690> years<00:02:55.989> at<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.380> point

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
year maybe even two years at this point

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.530 
year maybe even two years at this point
we<00:02:56.860> were<00:02:57.040> testing<00:02:57.489> ones<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.180> were<00:02:58.269> dyed

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
we were testing ones that were dyed

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.930 
we were testing ones that were dyed
because<00:02:59.380> I'd<00:02:59.530> always<00:02:59.709> had<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> blue<00:03:00.610> or

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
because I'd always had like a blue or

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.809 
because I'd always had like a blue or
purple<00:03:01.390> wax<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.350> decided<00:03:03.130> for<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.580> sake<00:03:03.760> of

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
purple wax but I decided for the sake of

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.809 
purple wax but I decided for the sake of
being<00:03:04.090> green<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:06.299> clear<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:09.250> happens<00:03:09.700> to

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
being green that clear this happens to

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.300 
being green that clear this happens to
be<00:03:09.850> clear<00:03:10.239> because<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:11.049> beeswax<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
be clear because the beeswax and the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.220 
be clear because the beeswax and the
rosin<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:14.880> naturally<00:03:15.880> these<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.630> color

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
rosin is naturally these this color

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.050 
rosin is naturally these this color
so<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.950> flicks<00:03:18.340> up<00:03:18.609> really<00:03:19.030> nicely<00:03:19.620> too<00:03:20.650> I

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
so this flicks up really nicely too I

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.020 
so this flicks up really nicely too I
don't<00:03:22.060> have<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:22.900> another<00:03:23.230> strip<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.850> put

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
don't have to have another strip to put

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.130 
don't have to have another strip to put
on<00:03:25.180> top<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.470> one<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.890> still<00:03:27.250> here<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.780> may

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
on top so this one is still here I may

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.080 
on top so this one is still here I may
even<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.500> leave<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.040> on<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.519> two<00:03:30.730> or<00:03:30.880> three

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
even just leave this on for two or three

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.690 
even just leave this on for two or three
minutes<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.780> show<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:33.040> left<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.549> on

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
minutes and show you I have left it on

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.620 
minutes and show you I have left it on
as<00:03:34.120> long<00:03:34.930> as<00:03:35.440> five<00:03:35.709> or<00:03:35.980> ten<00:03:36.299> minutes<00:03:37.299> when<00:03:37.600> I

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
as long as five or ten minutes when I

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.020 
as long as five or ten minutes when I
was<00:03:37.870> doing<00:03:38.200> other<00:03:38.410> stuff<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.340> swear<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.850> god

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
was doing other stuff and I swear to god

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.740 
was doing other stuff and I swear to god
it<00:03:40.329> never<00:03:40.359> breaks<00:03:41.519> also<00:03:42.519> this<00:03:43.120> wax<00:03:43.390> got

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it never breaks also this wax got

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.440 
it never breaks also this wax got
slightly<00:03:44.130> overheated<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.400> then<00:03:45.970> had<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.239> cool

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
slightly overheated and then had to cool

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.160 
slightly overheated and then had to cool
down<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:47.140> has<00:03:47.350> no<00:03:47.680> effect<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.609> how<00:03:49.329> this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
down that has no effect on how this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.460 
down that has no effect on how this
stuff<00:03:50.470> works<00:03:50.500> as<00:03:51.190> long<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:52.660> cools<00:03:53.049> down<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
stuff works as long as it cools down and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.819 
stuff works as long as it cools down and
you<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:58.630> know<00:03:58.750> apply<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.200> at<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.709> right

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
you you know apply it at the right

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.319 
you you know apply it at the right
temperature<00:04:00.069> so<00:04:00.519> you're<00:04:00.640> not<00:04:00.760> burning<00:04:01.269> people

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
temperature so you're not burning people

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.860 
temperature so you're not burning people
so<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.930> small<00:04:05.260> strip<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.690> this<00:04:07.690> was

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
so this is a small strip and this was

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.509 
so this is a small strip and this was
something<00:04:08.350> people<00:04:08.500> were<00:04:08.829> complaining<00:04:09.280> about

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
something people were complaining about

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.360 
something people were complaining about
breaking<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.510> wasn't<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.930> fast<00:04:11.170> Pole<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:12.340> I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
breaking that wasn't a fast Pole but I

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.490 
breaking that wasn't a fast Pole but I
want<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.760> show<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.410> how<00:04:14.410> thin<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:16.500> flexible

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
this is and this is partially because
