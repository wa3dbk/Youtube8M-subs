 Chemical for memories that will be the c 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.100
 coop 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.960

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.150
 problems name registration once

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.270
 do contact is always just after 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.330
 having done this step let's say 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.580
 complete installation and to go 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.630
 on the 4d cinema limiting area 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.510
 simply on this folder and in 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.850
 base if you have a 64 bit system a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.980
 system the 32 bit of you have to go up 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.860
 corresponding I 64 bit so I will go up 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.410
 This 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.860
 here is how you see the intercity started e 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.320
 in a framework it works perfectly 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.510

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.900
 tutorial on how to use it even if I don't 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.850

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.330
 that the video is finished here on the tutorial is 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.459
 ended up here but if you want to give me gods 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.720
 I know that advice to the territory to do 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.690
 however find that they also serve a 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.900
 you could as far as possible 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:58.050
