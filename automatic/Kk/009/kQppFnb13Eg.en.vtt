00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.490
 and we will draw what is more 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.260
 We like to eat. 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.300
 he is a very good child to be 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.760
 food is and everything it offers to me 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.920
 even if he does not want to try it 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.619
 there is a rule at home you may not like 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:36.640
 But you have to try, we'll go. 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.320
 make a very special drawing 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.500
 one thing I really like is a lot 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.500
 delicious is a pt 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 it's a drawing for me I want a show on 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 miami and cauliflower ii and neither arrived nor 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.809
 Do you think it 's? 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:18.229
 but now I wanted to know if you know 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:18.229
 to draw me a zucchini lettuce 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.510
 I asked them to do it with the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 drawings and the first thing I asked for 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.190
 that they designed and that's what they 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 but they liked to eat and he made the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:45.410
 drawings that drew this pizza from 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 chocolate the mayonnaise my stay nÃ© 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.180
 In a second moment we asked to 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.520
 to draw vegetables I've been talking to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.010
 and then I asked for the tail and the beet came 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.770
 so I chose to draw a madman 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.350
 even the clothes that I think are 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.479
 missing vegetables in his life but now 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.509
 I think I'll do differently, I'll do it. 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.470
 He buy it, get it, help me. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.420
 more in the kitchen is this catch I 'was' 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.010
 identifying all of it by painting it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.230
 will achieve 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.780
 childhood obesity is a very 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.760
 serious public health and here in Brazil 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.100
 this is no different 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.470
 children do not know where the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.460
 the origin of food are the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.940
 packages pay attention to what your child 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.400
 runs what gomi when hungry 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.530
 How does this work? 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.530
 a lot of difference in your child's health 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.210
 food for those who have part of us 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.210
 even though the children are the parents 1
