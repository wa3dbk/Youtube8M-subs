and I drag it into MPEG streamclip now I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
and I drag it into MPEG streamclip now I
just<00:01:34.470> want<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> say<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> hurry

you can you can drag this right into
final<00:01:40.740> cut<00:01:40.799> pro<00:01:41.090> if<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:43.049> you're

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
final cut pro if you want but you're

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.550 
final cut pro if you want but you're
gonna<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> render<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.460> before<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.970> can

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
gonna have to render it before you can

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
gonna have to render it before you can
do<00:01:46.560> anything<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.340> that's<00:01:48.299> really

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
do anything with it and that's really

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.819 
do anything with it and that's really
slow<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:49.020> why<00:01:49.170> we're<00:01:49.320> converting<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
slow so that's why we're converting it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.819 
slow so that's why we're converting it
first<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.780> go<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:51.960> MPEG<00:01:52.200> streamclip<00:01:54.590> now<00:01:55.590> if

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
first so go into MPEG streamclip now if

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.260 
first so go into MPEG streamclip now if
all<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> snip<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.969> video

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
all you want to do is snip this video

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.819 
all you want to do is snip this video
down<00:01:57.509> first<00:01:58.020> off<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.649> done<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
down first off you could have done that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
down first off you could have done that
in<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> iphone<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.090> easier

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
in the iphone which is actually easier

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.080 
in the iphone which is actually easier
but<00:02:00.869> um<00:02:02.090> say<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.149> wanted<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.600> video<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> start

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
but um say I wanted my video to start

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.010 
but um say I wanted my video to start
here<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:07.009> would<00:02:08.009> hit<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:09.000> keyboard<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
here I would hit I on my keyboard and I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.420 
here I would hit I on my keyboard and I
want<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> end<00:02:11.720> here

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
want it to end here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.530 
want it to end here
oh<00:02:14.409> let's<00:02:15.409> even<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.829> shorter<00:02:16.250> clips<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.730> don't

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
oh let's even do a shorter clips a don't

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.599 
oh let's even do a shorter clips a don't
did<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.219> now<00:02:19.219> go<00:02:19.519> edit<00:02:20.469> trim<00:02:21.469> and<00:02:21.769> now<00:02:22.459> I've

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
did it I now go edit trim and now I've

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.190 
did it I now go edit trim and now I've
trimmed<00:02:22.939> it<00:02:23.090> down<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.840> these<00:02:26.989> few

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
trimmed it down to just just these few

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.979 
trimmed it down to just just these few
seconds<00:02:28.239> there<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.359> go<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.409> now<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:32.060> go<00:02:32.329> to<00:02:32.359> file

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
seconds there we go so now we go to file

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.009 
seconds there we go so now we go to file
export<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:34.489> quicktime<00:02:34.689> now<00:02:35.689> if<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.930> have

multiple files you can go batch list and

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.580 
multiple files you can go batch list and
select<00:02:38.329> multiple<00:02:38.870> files<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.379> I<00:02:39.409> only

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
select multiple files but here I only

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.179 
select multiple files but here I only
have<00:02:39.739> one<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.579> X<00:02:40.730> for<00:02:40.909> QuickTime<00:02:41.980> we're<00:02:42.980> going

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
depends how dark it is so we're just

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.990

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
going to force it to always be 29 97 so

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.180 
going to force it to always be 29 97 so
there<00:03:17.599> we<00:03:17.690> go<00:03:17.720> appleton<00:03:18.169> remain<00:03:18.349> at<00:03:18.440> Kodak<00:03:18.739> now
