00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
made a test just show you guys so it's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510 
made a test just show you guys so it's
backwards<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.449> rotate<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.520> same

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
backwards I rotate it like this same

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.730 
backwards I rotate it like this same
it's<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> way<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.510> want<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.619> not

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it's not the way you want it it's not

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
video so in order to rotate it you you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
video so in order to rotate it you you
do<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:29.939> need<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.330> jailbroken<00:00:30.599> that's<00:00:31.109> one

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
do not need to be jailbroken that's one

I'll just zoom in up three guys right
there<00:00:49.710> focuses<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> app<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> called<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.649> rotate

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there focuses the app is called a rotate

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.810 
there focuses the app is called a rotate
video<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.270> simple<00:00:55.670> okay<00:00:57.170> I'll<00:00:58.820> refocus

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
video that simple okay I'll refocus

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.590 
video that simple okay I'll refocus
everything<00:01:00.710> hits<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> app<00:01:02.010> open<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.390> then

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
20 minutes to find it was just simple an

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.660 
20 minutes to find it was just simple an
app<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> App<00:02:02.369> Store

app in the App Store
I<00:02:02.960> started<00:02:03.960> doing<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> whole<00:02:04.380> bunch<00:02:04.409> research

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I started doing a whole bunch research

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
I started doing a whole bunch research
online<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.549> who<00:02:05.729> people<00:02:05.939> were<00:02:06.210> saying

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
online people who people were saying

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.119 
online people who people were saying

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that you need to do coding stuff and

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.669 
that you need to do coding stuff and
then<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.789> was<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.000> oh<00:02:09.209> man<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.259> try

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
then I was like oh man I'm going to try

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
then I was like oh man I'm going to try
figuring<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> out<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.550> then<00:02:11.700> there's<00:02:12.150> an<00:02:12.300> app

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
figuring it out but then there's an app

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
figuring it out but then there's an app
there's<00:02:13.290> an

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
