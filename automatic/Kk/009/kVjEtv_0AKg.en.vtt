00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello friends today to April 9 we are going to 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 talk about a climbing bush of the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 custer ya sinesis 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.780
 virginia that is native to japan 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.040
 the water obtained through seeds goes 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.500
 it takes like 10 years to bloom if 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.080
 it reaches its regions 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.320
 and without more let's see more closely the 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 tree 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.760
 known as glycine or 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 remove 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 and also as a feather flower is the uis 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.280
 iberia synthesis of the family of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.989
 legumes originating in china and japan- 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.339
 can live to be 100 years fix the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.539
 number of years this can live 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.850
 tree there is the variety of white flower 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.720
 known as alba 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.450
 and pods usually bear fruit 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.860
 elongated 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.260
 type legumes and velvety and very 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.540
 showy 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.420
 The best you can do if you buy 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.050
 a wisteria is to buy there with flower 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.150
 because sometimes they tell us that they are such 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.430
 variety and such a flower but 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 in very few cases the glycine does not 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.260
 flourish why it's best to buy it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.300
 when it is in the flowering season 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.240
 to make sure that if really the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.730
 flower is ideal for any kind of 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.980
 ground but not 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.950
 does not resist very flooded soils 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.190
 because if we plant it in a soil in the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 which form a lot of moisture can 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.340
 appear diseases caused by 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.900
 mushrooms yes yes that can reach us 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 dying endures dryness very well as 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.840
 well tell us I told you and the strong 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 frost you have to plant the deep well 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.630
 because it emits a lot of roots 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.480
 very vigorous that can colonize the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.240
 part where it is usually planted then 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 it is best to plant the very deep me 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.370
 to pay for the wisteria we are going to 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.920
 fertilize with organic fertilizer 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.130
 it is enough to pay once a year not 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 you need a lot of good glycemia 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.030
 the subscriptions 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.879
 a little before flowering a fertilizer 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.680
 as for roses a quality fertilizer goes 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.330
 to favor that the glycine bloom 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.270
 best 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.190
 in soils where there are high amounts 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:48.130
 of nitrogen this soil favors 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.130
 emit more soy than flower usually flourish 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.020
 in early spring and after 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.600
 it even usually in the middle of summer or 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.400
 Early autumn usually has again 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.590
 a second flowering here I show you 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.240
 the flowers more closely the flower of the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.530
 wisteria 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.770
 It is a mauve violet flower 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.200
 this year there were few good flowers 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.670
 now they start to bloom but like the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.010
 climate has been very unstable here in 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.380
 galicia in strong winds and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.239
 heavy rains have broken almost all 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.790
 flowers why in the little existence of 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.060
 the flowering a council is also that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.470
 you can the glycine basically this 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.569
 pruning is done in mid -winter and 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.959
 in the areas where the winters are very 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.410
 where there is usually freezing cold as there 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.600
 to prune in February 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.140
 I hope you liked this new 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.710
 story about wisteria 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.590
 virginia or pen flower your name 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.930
 botanic as I told you is the uis iberia 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.930
 wisteria sinesis see you soon friends
