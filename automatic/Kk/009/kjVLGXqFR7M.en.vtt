00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.520
 ah 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.380
 it's a letter to me but what is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.550
 doing here 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 dear turn 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.720
 I've finally got used to the environment 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.450
 this place and I must say that I am 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 very good but the truth is that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.600
 lately I've really wanted to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.670
 to see you 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.670
 [Music] 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.940
 yes 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.399
 [Music] 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.399
 but 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.410
 I did not know I wrote things like these 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.750
 shut up they have my name is and they are 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.310
 mine, besides, you wrote so many because 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.310
 you never sent a 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.800
 then stretch the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.479
 and what does that mean? 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.429
 they are not mine 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 but what the hell are you doing it depends 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.420
 What can be 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.890
 with this I feel I could live up to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 50 years ago 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.380
 [Music] 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.590
 it never was from the wall 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.990
 [Music] 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.080
 shut 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.080
 [Applause]
