 That there should be a lot of stories 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.150
 To do that, teachers need to know a lot and have family.

 If you write once, your teacher will be able to use the data 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.970
 Everything is baked without neglecting anything trivial . 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:40.090
 But we do not force children to collect data. 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.000
 Did I hear that story more than it derma 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.310

 I did not tell them to give it to the kids . 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.280
 Tell the class that has put such and recall the memories of the day 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.620
 You can talk. 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.019
 That's the face I happened to discuss the class teacher to give constricted throw topics 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.459
 The discussion goes on a. 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.459
 I can refer to the whole drawing and even the small pictures. 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:25.800
 So with pretty Toro's hands, they're going to play a lot , 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.800
 If you want to go this way without these things 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.479

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.020
 In the village which got me there are two master naeol happening 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.740

 Heavy and burdensome trends that you just hear . 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:04.139
 If the world is a village where 100 people live, 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.139
 Is there a burden on children? 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.910

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.630

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.740
 4 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.220
 So , I thought about the prescription of the teacher in the scenario, 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.220
 I will go 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:33.639
 If it is hard to give a little bit more difficult to reduce the viewing position is that person 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:36.879
 I think it's a way to do it. 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.689
 His disciples bawled up to Joe's Peak 7 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:43.629

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:59.999
 Oh, you mean to take me now, Buddha saw him and another 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:03.539
 Children always loved babies have been started in the scenario once the parties 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:07.529
 I think the idea is a little more specific and I hate it. 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:14.520
 I was by his other children, select the 4th 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:15.849
 I just need to think about my new self and think about it first, 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.139

 Oh, well, change it. 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:49.919

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.700
 Oh Oh Yeo Oh 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:58.450
