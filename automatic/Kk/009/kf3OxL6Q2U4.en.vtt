so<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.840> Jaheim<00:00:55.440> put<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> woman<00:00:56.520> first

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so that was Jaheim put that woman first

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.479 
so that was Jaheim put that woman first
that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.930> an<00:00:58.050> F<00:00:58.230> minor<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> we'll<00:01:00.269> get<00:01:00.510> started

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
that is an F minor so we'll get started

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.630 
that is an F minor so we'll get started
by<00:01:02.489> breaking<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:04.199> chords<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.190> chord

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
by breaking down the chords the chord

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160 
by breaking down the chords the chord
progression<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.149> not<00:01:06.330> too<00:01:06.509> difficult<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
progression is not too difficult and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.030 
progression is not too difficult and
it's<00:01:07.950> pretty<00:01:08.160> similar<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:08.789> the<00:01:09.450> first<00:01:09.690> chord

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.470 

that's<00:01:15.040> pretty<00:01:15.490> large<00:01:15.670> F<00:01:15.940> minor<00:01:16.180> Ford<00:01:16.540> will<00:01:17.260> go

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
that's pretty large F minor Ford will go

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:29.580 
that's pretty large F minor Ford will go
F<00:01:19.480> minor<00:01:19.870> 9th<00:01:24.540> turn<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.660> down<00:01:25.810> for<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> second<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
F minor 9th turn it down for a second so

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.080 
F minor 9th turn it down for a second so
you<00:01:29.650> can<00:01:29.860> play<00:01:30.010> that<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:30.370> your<00:01:30.550> initial<00:01:30.700> for

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
you can play that as your initial for

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.950 
you can play that as your initial for
which<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.330> will<00:01:31.420> be<00:01:31.510> F<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.990> flat<00:01:32.320> C<00:01:32.620> E<00:01:32.800> flat<00:01:32.860> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
which it will be F a flat C E flat a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.710 
which it will be F a flat C E flat a
flat<00:01:34.960> C<00:01:35.590> E<00:01:35.830> flat<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.550> then<00:01:36.940> cheating<00:01:37.420> which

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
flat C E flat and then cheating which

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
flat C E flat and then cheating which
makes<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.260> 9th<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:39.160> that's<00:01:39.700> optional

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
makes the 9th but that's optional

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.830 
makes the 9th but that's optional
so<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.670> first<00:01:42.910> notes<00:01:43.180> are<00:01:43.360> being<00:01:43.510> played<00:01:43.630> in

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
so the first notes are being played in

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.070 
so the first notes are being played in
the<00:01:43.900> right<00:01:44.080> hand<00:01:44.350> are<00:01:44.830> going<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.220> be<00:01:45.310> F<00:01:45.550> E<00:01:46.080> flat

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
the right hand are going to be F E flat

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the right hand are going to be F E flat
C<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.800> F<00:01:54.340> E<00:01:54.910> flat<00:01:55.450> C<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.230> I'm<00:01:56.500> rolling<00:01:56.950> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
C so it's F E flat C and I'm rolling the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.150 
C so it's F E flat C and I'm rolling the
left-hand<00:01:57.700> chord<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.870> F<00:01:59.140> minor<00:01:59.410> I'm<00:01:59.740> rolling

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
left-hand chord this F minor I'm rolling

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.420 
left-hand chord this F minor I'm rolling
it<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:02.260> it's<00:02:02.680> F<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:04.180> flat<00:02:04.450> C<00:02:04.810> E<00:02:05.080> flat<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:05.950> not<00:02:06.130> not

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
it so it's F a flat C E flat but not not

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.620 
it so it's F a flat C E flat but not not
all<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.640> wants<00:02:07.090> as<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.080> standard<00:02:09.119> block<00:02:10.119> pattern

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
all I wants as a standard block pattern

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.240 
all I wants as a standard block pattern
you're<00:02:11.050> not<00:02:11.170> playing<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.530> way<00:02:11.800> you're<00:02:12.040> kind

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
of rolling it like one kind of the glide

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
of rolling it like one kind of the glide
that's<00:02:19.110> pretty<00:02:19.920> common<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.280> gospel<00:02:20.790> jazz<00:02:21.780> and

be a flat B flat C and I just play that
I<00:05:25.730> played<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:28.310> pillar<00:05:28.670> as<00:05:28.970> an<00:05:29.120> octave

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
I played it a pillar as an octave

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.659 
I played it a pillar as an octave
basically<00:05:30.740> with<00:05:31.340> both<00:05:31.490> hands

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.890 

or<00:05:37.669> you<00:05:37.909> play<00:05:38.090> down<00:05:38.300> here<00:05:38.330> even<00:05:38.810> more<00:05:40.780> it's<00:05:41.780> up

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
or you play down here even more it's up

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.309 
or you play down here even more it's up
to<00:05:42.050> you<00:05:42.199> but<00:05:43.009> basically<00:05:43.310> that<00:05:43.550> whole<00:05:44.319> melody

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
to you but basically that whole melody

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.770 
to you but basically that whole melody
sessions<00:05:45.800> can<00:05:45.919> be<00:05:46.129> a<00:05:46.340> flat<00:05:47.000> B<00:05:47.509> flat<00:05:47.539> C<00:05:48.319> F<00:05:48.680> and

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
sessions can be a flat B flat C F and

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:57.070 
sessions can be a flat B flat C F and
then<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:50.990> little<00:05:51.259> turnaround<00:05:55.960> which<00:05:56.960> is

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
then that little turnaround which is

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.800 
then that little turnaround which is
going<00:05:57.199> to<00:05:57.319> be<00:05:57.439> E<00:05:57.770> flat<00:05:58.550> F<00:05:58.819> a<00:05:59.300> foot<00:05:59.870> a<00:06:00.050> flat<00:06:00.469> seam

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
going to be E flat F a foot a flat seam

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.670 
going to be E flat F a foot a flat seam
and<00:06:03.490> then<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:04.639> resolves<00:06:05.060> on<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.300> flat<00:06:05.569> major<00:06:05.750> a

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.969 

flat<00:06:12.680> right<00:06:13.129> there<00:06:13.900> so<00:06:14.900> from<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.259> top<00:06:15.500> of<00:06:15.800> that

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
flat right there so from the top of that

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:23.129 
flat right there so from the top of that
it's<00:06:16.219> going<00:06:16.310> to<00:06:16.400> be

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.649 

and<00:06:24.429> then<00:06:25.429> if<00:06:25.519> you<00:06:25.610> drop<00:06:25.849> down<00:06:26.059> to<00:06:26.119> an<00:06:26.389> a-flat

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
and then if you drop down to an a-flat

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:35.379 
and then if you drop down to an a-flat
major<00:06:26.899> down<00:06:27.229> here<00:06:27.499> a<00:06:32.259> flat<00:06:33.259> E<00:06:33.529> flat<00:06:33.800> a<00:06:34.429> flat<00:06:34.459> C<00:06:35.119> a

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
major down here a flat E flat a flat C a

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.909 
major down here a flat E flat a flat C a
flat<00:06:36.050> or<00:06:36.439> E<00:06:36.800> flat<00:06:36.830> a<00:06:37.309> flat<00:06:38.589> so<00:06:39.589> one<00:06:39.739> more<00:06:39.889> time

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
flat or E flat a flat so one more time

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:45.880 
flat or E flat a flat so one more time
slow<00:06:40.610> motion

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.680

flat and the scene but I'm playing in an
octave<00:06:56.670> lower<00:06:56.730> since<00:06:57.120> you<00:06:57.330> can't<00:06:57.540> see<00:06:57.750> it<00:06:57.840> all

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
octave lower since you can't see it all

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.050 
octave lower since you can't see it all
off<00:06:58.560> its<00:06:58.800> off<00:06:58.950> the<00:06:59.100> camera<00:07:01.550> so<00:07:02.550> trust<00:07:02.850> me<00:07:02.940> I'm

playing a D flat in the space down here

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:14.810 
playing a D flat in the space down here
and<00:07:06.290> then<00:07:07.290> I<00:07:07.620> resolve<00:07:08.130> on<00:07:08.340> a<00:07:08.520> flat<00:07:08.790> major<00:07:13.820> so

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
and then I resolve on a flat major so

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.210 
and then I resolve on a flat major so
one<00:07:15.000> more<00:07:15.150> time<00:07:15.390> without<00:07:16.040> any<00:07:17.040> more
