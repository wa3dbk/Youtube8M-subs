00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.980
 Hello Regomaru This time I tried to create a balance in Lego 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 The appearance is simple like this 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.450
 Let's do it right away 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.970
 First here is the dial and here is the release lever here is the drawer 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:27.440
 First try turning the dial appropriately 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 However, the release lever does not come off and it does not pull 4 volumes 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.560
 But this dial 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.660
 Clockwise to orange 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.860
 When decommissioning counterclockwise 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.860
 This goes up and the drawer also opens 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.000
 I will explain the mechanism next 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.859
 Yes yes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.859
 Took 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.340
 The mechanism is this 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.930
 First of all 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.190
 To lower the release lever 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 Make this orange 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.860
 Then here you can cavity 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 Then the release lever will go up because this will be removed 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.400
 It does not go up because this is disturbing 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.790
 Then it to the gray 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.159
 Nowhere in the way that disappears can also cavity here and to decommissioning 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.520
 It can be raised this way 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.470
 This stopper well Gully that was disturbing this 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.970
 This is the mechanism that open pin 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.610
 And when I put it back, it was just the opposite 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.720
 I write this down and I have this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.640
 If you do this, you will not be able to open it again 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.930
 I am 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.930
 Thank you for watching until the end I'm glad if you give me a comment
