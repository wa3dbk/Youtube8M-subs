indeed<00:06:11.850> well<00:06:12.850> sometimes<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.450> makes<00:06:13.600> you

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
indeed well sometimes it makes you

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.080 
indeed well sometimes it makes you
wonder<00:06:13.870> what<00:06:14.620> a<00:06:14.860> rider<00:06:15.220> can<00:06:15.490> do<00:06:15.700> when<00:06:15.970> they're

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
wonder what a rider can do when they're

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.670 
wonder what a rider can do when they're
absolutely<00:06:16.510> pushed<00:06:16.840> to<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.110> limit<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:17.620> I

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
absolutely pushed to the limit and I

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.440 
absolutely pushed to the limit and I
think<00:06:17.890> the<00:06:18.010> fact<00:06:18.250> that<00:06:18.340> haichen<00:06:18.580> was<00:06:18.940> fired<00:06:19.240> up

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
think the fact that haichen was fired up

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.900 
think the fact that haichen was fired up
to<00:06:19.930> try<00:06:20.140> and<00:06:20.260> catch<00:06:20.440> this<00:06:20.710> bunch<00:06:20.980> he<00:06:21.430> got<00:06:21.610> such

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
to try and catch this bunch he got such

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.700 
to try and catch this bunch he got such
a<00:06:21.940> faster<00:06:22.510> pace<00:06:22.750> throughout<00:06:23.140> the<00:06:23.290> whole<00:06:23.440> race

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
a faster pace throughout the whole race

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.260 
a faster pace throughout the whole race
that<00:06:23.980> when<00:06:24.100> he<00:06:24.160> caught<00:06:24.370> them<00:06:24.580> he's<00:06:24.970> passed

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
that when he caught them he's passed

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.180 
that when he caught them he's passed
them<00:06:25.510> and<00:06:25.660> they<00:06:25.900> not<00:06:26.200> up<00:06:26.410> their<00:06:26.650> pace<00:06:26.920> and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
them and they not up their pace and

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.490 
them and they not up their pace and
Hodgins<00:06:27.730> continued<00:06:28.390> his<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:28.870> that's<00:06:29.320> how

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
Hodgins continued his and that's how

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.650 
Hodgins continued his and that's how
come<00:06:29.710> he's<00:06:29.860> got<00:06:30.040> that<00:06:30.250> lead<00:06:30.460> however<00:06:31.090> he<00:06:31.510> came

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
come he's got that lead however he came

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.540
