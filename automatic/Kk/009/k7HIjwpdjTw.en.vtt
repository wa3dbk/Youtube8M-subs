as<00:01:08.910> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.149> see<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> snow<00:01:09.840> state<00:01:10.320> really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
as you can see the snow state really

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.430 
as you can see the snow state really
light<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.729> dry<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.840> should<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
light and dry and that should be the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.499 
light and dry and that should be the
case<00:01:13.649> in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> next<00:01:14.160> few<00:01:14.310> days<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.210> no

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
case in the next few days as there is no

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.469

really<00:01:16.289> rising<00:01:16.800> temperatures<00:01:17.310> expected<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
really rising temperatures expected the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.749 
really rising temperatures expected the
avalanche<00:01:24.869> risk<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.320> clearly<00:01:25.979> decrees<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
avalanche risk as clearly decrees that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.810 
avalanche risk as clearly decrees that
since<00:01:27.570> last<00:01:28.049> week<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.189> snow<00:01:29.250> mental

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
like to insist and say that it's still

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.170 
like to insist and say that it's still
on<00:01:36.840> three<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> five<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.189> nobody<00:01:39.000> should

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
on three out of five so nobody should

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.030 
on three out of five so nobody should
golf<00:01:39.329> place<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.930> without<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.470> necessary

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
golf place really without the necessary

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.569 
golf place really without the necessary
safety<00:01:41.970> equipment<00:01:42.590> transceiver<00:01:43.590> trouble

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
safety equipment transceiver trouble

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
safety equipment transceiver trouble
probe<00:01:44.939> etc

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.300 

as<00:01:52.990> opposed<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.380> last<00:01:53.590> week<00:01:53.860> there<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.130> no

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
as opposed to last week there is no

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.130 
as opposed to last week there is no
point<00:01:54.550> going<00:01:54.820> as<00:01:55.060> high<00:01:55.240> as<00:01:55.300> possible<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.960> get

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
point going as high as possible to get

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.880 
point going as high as possible to get
some<00:01:56.500> good<00:01:57.010> snow<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.020> wind<00:01:59.260> has<00:01:59.410> affected

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
some good snow the the wind has affected

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.660 
some good snow the the wind has affected
the<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.580> snow<00:02:00.790> mental<00:02:01.180> above<00:02:02.580> 2,300<00:02:03.580> meters

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
the the snow mental above 2,300 meters

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.240 
the the snow mental above 2,300 meters
so<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> best<00:02:04.930> best<00:02:05.470> King<00:02:05.680> really<00:02:05.950> will<00:02:06.100> be
