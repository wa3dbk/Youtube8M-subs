00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:52.549 
we are back to the mountaintop the

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:54.039 
we are back to the mountaintop the
reason<00:04:52.789> I<00:04:52.849> set<00:04:53.029> up<00:04:53.059> the<00:04:53.209> showcase<00:04:53.569> up<00:04:53.749> here<00:04:53.959> is

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:54.049 
reason I set up the showcase up here is

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:56.679 
reason I set up the showcase up here is
because<00:04:54.199> we're<00:04:54.799> exploring<00:04:55.339> today<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:56.119> top<00:04:56.509> of

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
because we're exploring today on top of

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.509 
because we're exploring today on top of
Matta<00:04:56.869> thought<00:04:57.019> that<00:04:57.169> was<00:04:57.259> a<00:04:57.319> cool<00:04:57.439> area<00:04:57.769> so

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:58.519 
Matta thought that was a cool area so

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.909 
Matta thought that was a cool area so
this<00:04:58.669> one<00:04:58.939> you<00:04:59.209> control<00:05:00.199> people<00:05:00.349> I<00:05:00.619> don't<00:05:00.769> see

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
this one you control people I don't see

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:01.959 
this one you control people I don't see
why<00:05:01.099> you'd<00:05:01.279> want<00:05:01.459> to<00:05:01.489> use<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.729> one<00:05:01.879> yourself

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
why you'd want to use this one yourself

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.239 
why you'd want to use this one yourself
because<00:05:02.539> there's<00:05:02.749> no<00:05:02.959> way<00:05:03.110> back<00:05:03.349> you<00:05:03.979> can't

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
because there's no way back you can't

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:05.709 
because there's no way back you can't
get<00:05:04.429> back<00:05:04.610> from<00:05:04.789> us<00:05:04.879> you<00:05:04.969> know<00:05:05.089> the<00:05:05.209> location

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
get back from us you know the location

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.139 
get back from us you know the location
so<00:05:06.349> basically<00:05:06.860> this<00:05:07.309> is<00:05:07.459> what<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.639> was<00:05:07.819> thinking

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:08.149 
so basically this is what I was thinking

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:10.809

I'll<00:06:24.529> just<00:06:24.649> bring<00:06:24.829> you<00:06:24.979> somewhere<00:06:25.279> else<00:06:25.459> in

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
I'll just bring you somewhere else in

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.159 
I'll just bring you somewhere else in
the<00:06:25.639> nether<00:06:25.849> like<00:06:26.149> far<00:06:26.360> away<00:06:26.569> but<00:06:26.629> we<00:06:26.989> gotta

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
the nether like far away but we gotta

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.259 
the nether like far away but we gotta
try<00:06:27.439> it<00:06:27.499> at<00:06:27.619> least<00:06:27.829> so<00:06:28.699> now<00:06:28.819> we're<00:06:28.939> the<00:06:29.029> swamp

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:29.269 
try it at least so now we're the swamp

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:30.969 
try it at least so now we're the swamp
so<00:06:29.989> you<00:06:30.110> could<00:06:30.259> really<00:06:30.379> end<00:06:30.559> out<00:06:30.619> anywhere<00:06:30.949> I

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
so you could really end out anywhere I

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.589 
so you could really end out anywhere I
think<00:06:31.159> this<00:06:31.249> is<00:06:31.339> really<00:06:31.549> sick<00:06:31.909> for<00:06:31.939> exploring

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
think this is really sick for exploring

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.389 
think this is really sick for exploring
like<00:06:33.079> I<00:06:33.199> was<00:06:33.349> saying<00:06:33.559> before<00:06:33.619> guys<00:06:34.039> you<00:06:34.219> could

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.369 
like I was saying before guys you could
set<00:06:34.639> up<00:06:34.669> like<00:06:34.969> a<00:06:34.999> door<00:06:35.360> in<00:06:35.599> your<00:06:35.629> house<00:06:35.959> and
