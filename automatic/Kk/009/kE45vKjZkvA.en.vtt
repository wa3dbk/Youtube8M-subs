00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.540
 in this video we are going to talk about 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.029
 ms 31 32 brand computers 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.009
 sim in which they apply to 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.070
 nissan platina and celery and reyno clio 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.510
 2002 to 2007 models 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.949
 It is important to note that these 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.990
 computers can serve both for 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.840
 automatic and manual transmission but without 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.280
 However, they are different, although these 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 they really are the same 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.079
 the operation varies so if 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.260
 someone does not have the caution of 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.129
 review the application can cause 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.129
 failures in 20 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 the identification modes is more 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 simple is by means of the decal 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 we can see that they bring a number of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.920
 part which if it ends in 0 1 we 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.350
 indicates that it is for manual transmission 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.660
 and on the contrary 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.039
 ends at 10 the computer is for 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.039
 automatic transmission 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 we know that sometimes 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.240
 computers especially when they are 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.100
 used can no longer count on the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.440
 decal and this was the case 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.110
 we could identify them by means of 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.150
 the components we would have to disarm 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.560
 the computer and we could observe by 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.140
 example that while the transmission 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.840
 automatic brings this component 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.840
 the manual transmission is not going to bring 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.789
 and we are seeing the image we saw the 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.740
 automatic we are now seeing the 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.140
 Manual and see that indeed the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.539
 trailers of components by means of a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 comparative image we can see that both 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.750
 computers are different 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.640
 Here we are observing, we see how 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.350
 while the manual lacks the component 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.350
 of automatic 50 with eyes 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.190
 not only these components are the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 that we need also we see that of the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.880
 another side of the tablet there are others 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.100
 components that if the try those of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.899
 automatic transmission however that of 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.899
 manual transmission will not have him 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 we look again at the image 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.319
 comparative where by means of arrows 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.819
 we have the comparison between manual and 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.799
 automatic and we observe that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.450
 effectively the components that it brings 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.450
 one we are not 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.790
 in this way we can identify the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.859
 application of computers either 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.239
 automatic manual the way we do 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.189
 the replacement by the computer 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.189
 corresponding and avoid failures
