00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.190
 good girls of united one more day to the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.250
 channel and in the video what I wanted was 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.019
 show you a makeup that you can do 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 that is super simple for the beginning of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.929
 the classes because I know there are a lot 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 of you who has already started the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.250
 classes and others that you're going to start very 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.110
 soon so thought of a super look 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.930
 nice that you can do for the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.669
 mornings I am very easy and fast and I know that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 many of you - makeups so 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.779
 except me when I went to classes I never 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.759
 I made up I see many others it's a little 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.649
 more flirtatious if you like it so make-up 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.359
 put a little bit more stuff in the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.550
 face so the makeup that I thought 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.070
 do for this video is very simple 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 but at the same time it's feminine and it shows that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.190
 you are made up man you do not notice that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.960
 you carry 8,000 shadows but you get that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 you are a little more arranged and if you 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 I want to see how I've made him follow 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.109
 definitely watching for day to day 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.940
 I advise a lot of a baby crime 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.460
 because it is super light and has a look 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.199
 very natural and it is very very easy to put 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.850
 in the morning when you have a lot 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.140
 in a hurry because he simply applies it 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.140
 as if it was a moisturizer 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.140
 for the eyebrows I'm going to fill in the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.790
 simply with the pencil that always 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.960
 I use and I'm going to blur them so that 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:19.970
 look even more natural and we go with 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.619
 the proofreader I've been using this one 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.869
 kiko every day since I've 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.970
 bought because it looks great on the skin 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.619
 and I have very dry skin, I do not know 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.090
 dry for nothing to me it makes me in lines 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.610
 of expression so for now I 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.789
 love it and I'm applying it right in 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.470
 the area of ​​the atopic dark circles and 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.970
 fix all the liquid products that 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.660
 I just put it, I'm applying a 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.660
 translucent powder 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.850
 I seem to go every day to school 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.979
 with the black line is too much or so 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 less for me so a line a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.880
 outlined brown with a brown shadow 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.920
 very subtle and blurred I think that 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.110
 it looks great and also makes the eyes 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 also very much the attention for 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.520
 mark a little bit more lashes I'll 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.649
 to use a brown shadow rossi is 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.640
 clarita at the back of the eyelashes just 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.640
 the external part 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.860
 and do not miss the mascara 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.599
 please, I'm going to put on my mask 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.550

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.140
 my favorite eyelash mask of all 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.319
 times as I always say it is the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.510
 lore to the volume is the sre and I love 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.690
 it's super black, it separates you a lot 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.670
 eyelashes is perfect in terms of 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.440
 blusher I love blushes in 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.690
 cream because they give a super natural look 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.400
 so to go to classes every day 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.069
 I think the cream blushes are 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.600
 ideals this time I'm using one of 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.060
 schleck that has one that is a color 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.069

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.030
 blur with the brush and I'm also going to 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.470
 blur it with my fingers I do not know why 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.209
 what but lately I'm getting 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
 the blusher before putting on the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.230

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.430

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.430
 of the nose and also on the chin 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.120
 what better than a Vaseline with color 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.160
