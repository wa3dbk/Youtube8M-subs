00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that's the 203 oh we can't really do 303

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.270 
that's the 203 oh we can't really do 303
oh<00:00:37.739> there<00:00:38.480> maybe<00:00:39.800> that's<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> wait<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
oh there maybe that's to wait for you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
oh there maybe that's to wait for you
but<00:00:41.820> um<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> idea<00:00:44.820> having<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
but um I like the idea having all the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.869 
but um I like the idea having all the
same<00:00:45.780> window<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> looks<00:00:46.170> good<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.520> enough<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
same window it looks good and enough to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.200 
same window it looks good and enough to
worry<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.840> neighbors<00:00:48.960> over<00:00:49.379> there

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
worry about the neighbors over there

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.970 
on the studs I saw being held up by
these<00:02:20.319> dude<00:02:20.650> do<00:02:20.799> my<00:02:20.950> divorce<00:02:21.159> but<00:02:22.980> some

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
these dude do my divorce but some

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.190 
these dude do my divorce but some
tension<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.459> them<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.239> surprisingly<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.170> as

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
tension on them but surprisingly not as

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.720 
tension on them but surprisingly not as
much<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:26.830> given<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.400> entire

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
much as you think given the entire

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.920 
much as you think given the entire
amount<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.030> weight<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.209> there<00:02:28.329> and<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.900> course

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
amount of weight up there and of course

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.140 
amount of weight up there and of course
you've<00:02:29.140> got<00:02:29.260> those<00:02:29.519> cross<00:02:30.519> members<00:02:30.849> are<00:02:30.970> also

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
you've got those cross members are also

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.140 
you've got those cross members are also
now<00:02:31.480> eventually<00:02:31.720> there'll<00:02:31.989> be<00:02:32.049> six<00:02:32.409> columns

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
now eventually there'll be six columns

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.729 
now eventually there'll be six columns
holding<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.390> probably<00:02:34.510> one<00:02:34.840> two<00:02:35.230> three

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
holding this up probably one two three

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.819 
holding this up probably one two three
then<00:02:35.980> two<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.879> on<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> other<00:02:37.090> side<00:02:37.769> what<00:02:38.769> we

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
then two more on the other side what we

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.690 
then two more on the other side what we
can't<00:02:39.010> put<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.220> columns<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.959> until<00:02:40.959> we<00:02:44.700> pour

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
can't put the columns in until we pour

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.130 
can't put the columns in until we pour
the<00:02:46.000> you'll<00:02:46.120> pour<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.420> concrete<00:02:46.870> in

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the you'll pour the concrete in

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.110 
the you'll pour the concrete in
here<00:02:47.319> we<00:02:48.250> got<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.459> back<00:02:48.549> for<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.760> little<00:02:48.940> dirt

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
here we got it back for a little dirt

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.000 
here we got it back for a little dirt
and<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.349> conjugate<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:50.769> we<00:02:50.829> can<00:02:50.920> put

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and for the conjugate then we can put

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.599 
and for the conjugate then we can put
the<00:02:51.069> columns<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:52.799> now<00:02:53.799> before<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.129> put<00:02:54.310> shingles

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
the columns in now before I put shingles

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.330 
the columns in now before I put shingles
on<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.879> roof<00:02:55.030> I'll<00:02:55.209> probably<00:02:55.510> stick<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> full

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
on that roof I'll probably stick a full

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.729 
on that roof I'll probably stick a full
before<00:02:57.609> beside<00:02:57.940> each<00:02:57.970> one<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.329> those<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:59.590> cuz

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
before beside each one of those just cuz

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.890 
before beside each one of those just cuz
it'll<00:02:59.859> make<00:03:00.010> me<00:03:00.129> feel<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.730> little<00:03:00.819> better<00:03:00.970> still

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
it'll make me feel a little better still

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.789 
it'll make me feel a little better still
got<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.019> hole<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.349> side<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.650> house

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
got a hole in the side of the house

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.940 
got a hole in the side of the house
that's<00:03:03.220> because<00:03:03.579> the<00:03:03.879> tub<00:03:04.739> isn't<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:05.859> place

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
that's because the tub isn't in place

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.199 
that's because the tub isn't in place
where<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.250> tubs<00:03:06.459> are<00:03:06.609> in<00:03:06.730> there<00:03:06.909> they've<00:03:07.090> been

we're gonna go through that knock those

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.539 
we're gonna go through that knock those
studs<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.799> go<00:03:12.010> through<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.370> get<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
studs that go through there you get the

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.900 
studs that go through there you get the
tub<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:12.879> double<00:03:13.510> unit

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910

this<00:03:29.260> entire<00:03:29.799> front<00:03:30.129> porch<00:03:30.400> right<00:03:30.609> now<00:03:30.730> it's

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
this entire front porch right now it's

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.869 
this entire front porch right now it's
being<00:03:30.970> held<00:03:31.090> up<00:03:31.239> with<00:03:32.340> two<00:03:33.340> two<00:03:33.609> fours

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
being held up with two two fours

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.869 
being held up with two two fours
surprisingly<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:36.250> not<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.549> much<00:03:36.700> weight

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
surprisingly it's not that much weight

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.750 
surprisingly it's not that much weight
on<00:03:37.030> them<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:38.950> my<00:03:39.069> gosh<00:03:39.280> but<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.669> know

on them you think my gosh but you know
of<00:03:39.849> course<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> trust<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.660> holding<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> lot<00:03:41.079> of

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
of course the trust is holding a lot of

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.050 
of course the trust is holding a lot of
low<00:03:41.290> there<00:03:41.500> also<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:44.260> I'm<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.709> I'm<00:03:45.280> gonna<00:03:45.459> I'm

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
low there also but I'm a I'm gonna I'm

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
gonna make a tea out of that I'm gonna

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.550 
gonna make a tea out of that I'm gonna
stick<00:03:48.310> another<00:03:48.519> one<00:03:48.730> yeah<00:03:49.139> just<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.349> make

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
stick another one yeah just to make

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.369 
stick another one yeah just to make
myself<00:03:50.799> feel<00:03:51.400> better<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:53.019> we're<00:03:53.169> really

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
myself feel better but we're really

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.900 
myself feel better but we're really
digging<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.889> symmetry<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.489> house<00:03:54.699> how

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
digging the symmetry of this house how

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.750 
digging the symmetry of this house how
it's<00:03:55.060> coming<00:03:55.239> out<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.799> like<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.980> two-tier

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
it's coming out I like the two-tier

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.319 
it's coming out I like the two-tier
roofline<00:03:59.280> that's<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.430> much<00:04:00.639> extra<00:04:00.970> expense

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
roofline that's not much extra expense

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.619 
roofline that's not much extra expense
or<00:04:01.480> hassle<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:02.290> do<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:03.579> it<00:04:03.699> sets<00:04:04.449> your

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
or hassle to do that but it sets your

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.089 
or hassle to do that but it sets your
house<00:04:04.750> apart<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.139> little<00:04:05.260> bit<00:04:05.530> gives<00:04:05.949> it<00:04:06.010> a

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
house apart a little bit gives it a

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.280 
house apart a little bit gives it a
little<00:04:06.220> more<00:04:06.370> character

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.720 

so<00:04:11.290> far<00:04:11.500> we're<00:04:11.650> pretty<00:04:11.830> pleased<00:04:12.100> with<00:04:12.640> how

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
so far we're pretty pleased with how

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.720 
so far we're pretty pleased with how
this<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.030> going<00:04:13.210> I<00:04:13.510> had<00:04:14.140> originally<00:04:14.320> thought

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
this is going I had originally thought
