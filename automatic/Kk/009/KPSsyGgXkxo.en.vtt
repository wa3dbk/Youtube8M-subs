00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
about area so there's too many places

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.930 
about area so there's too many places
where<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.710> want<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> kill<00:00:08.069> them<00:00:08.189> first<00:00:08.670> being

where you want to kill them first being

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.580 
where you want to kill them first being
kordell's<00:00:09.300> dungeon<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.349> north

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
kordell's dungeon so you just got north

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.810 
kordell's dungeon so you just got north
of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.769> darkbeast<00:00:11.070> said<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.580> you're<00:00:11.700> there

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
of the darkbeast said and you're there

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.030 
of the darkbeast said and you're there
and<00:00:12.200> since<00:00:13.200> they<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.469> similar<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.920> body

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
and since they look similar and body

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.990 
and since they look similar and body
type<00:00:14.280> then<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.849> guess<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.540> quick<00:00:15.750> trick<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
type then I guess just a quick trick to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
type then I guess just a quick trick to
helping<00:00:18.000> remember<00:00:18.240> way<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> kill<00:00:18.570> them<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.920> so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
helping remember way to kill them and so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.710 
helping remember way to kill them and so
the<00:00:20.010> second<00:00:20.220> place<00:00:20.400> would<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.609> west<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the second place would be west of the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.779 
the second place would be west of the
fairy<00:00:21.930> ring<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.890> stores<00:00:23.189> fishing<00:00:23.490> colony

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
fairy ring at the stores fishing colony

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and to get there just enter in a cake

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
and to get there just enter in a cake
you<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> favoring<00:00:28.170> code<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:29.279> it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
you for the favoring code and then it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
you for the favoring code and then it's
just<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:30.029> bit<00:00:30.119> west<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> there<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
just a little bit west of there to that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
just a little bit west of there to that
pointing<00:00:31.439> little<00:00:31.679> island<00:00:31.980> right<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.870> I

prefer this place though because they're

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.410 
prefer this place though because they're
a<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.809> clustered<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.270> bit

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
ability which stuns it and does it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.569 
ability which stuns it and does it
crap-ton<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.509> damage<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.500> saw<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
crap-ton of damage as you just saw you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.390 
crap-ton of damage as you just saw you
can<00:01:29.700> also<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.030> destroy<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
can also use destroy but that because it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
can also use destroy but that because it
also<00:01:32.549> stunts<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.479> one's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.960> little

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
also stunts but that's one's a little

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.370 
also stunts but that's one's a little
less<00:01:34.350> dependable<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> other<00:01:37.229> hand

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
less dependable so on the other hand

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
occasionally so that's usually enough

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.970 
occasionally so that's usually enough
for<00:04:03.320> me<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.950> maintain<00:04:04.250> my<00:04:04.550> health<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.590> as<00:04:06.920> you

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
see five minutes are closing in on my

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.410 
see five minutes are closing in on my
overload<00:04:11.210> dose<00:04:11.710> so<00:04:12.710> in<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.940> five<00:04:14.120> minutes

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
overload dose so in the five minutes

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.860 
overload dose so in the five minutes
that<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:15.620> recorded<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.640> gained<00:04:17.269> about<00:04:17.390> twenty

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
that I recorded I gained about twenty

that I recorded I gained about twenty
Kasler<00:04:18.320> XP<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.940> multiply<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.750> by<00:04:20.810> twelve<00:04:20.930> to

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
Kasler XP so multiply that by twelve to

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.160 
Kasler XP so multiply that by twelve to
get<00:04:21.500> out<00:04:21.680> early<00:04:21.709> late<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.610> get<00:04:22.870> 264<00:04:23.870> case

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
get out early late and you get 264 case

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.410 
get out early late and you get 264 case
letters<00:04:24.560> P<00:04:24.740> an<00:04:24.830> hour<00:04:24.920> which<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:26.000> absolutely

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
letters P an hour which is absolutely

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.180 
letters P an hour which is absolutely
ridiculous<00:04:26.840> compared<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.740> everything<00:04:28.010> else

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
ridiculous compared to everything else

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.320 
ridiculous compared to everything else
that's<00:04:28.400> out<00:04:28.550> there<00:04:28.790> everything<00:04:31.330> good

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
that's out there everything good

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.830 
that's out there everything good
something<00:04:32.990> that's<00:04:33.230> good<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.740> like<00:04:33.970> 120<00:04:34.970> k<00:04:35.450> so

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
something that's good is like 120 k so

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.000 
something that's good is like 120 k so
your<00:04:35.960> screen<00:04:36.200> our<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.650> is<00:04:36.800> more<00:04:36.980> than

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
your screen our and this is more than

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.730 
your screen our and this is more than
double<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:37.970> that's<00:04:38.120> amazing<00:04:38.710> also<00:04:39.710> I

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
double of it so that's amazing also I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.780 
double of it so that's amazing also I
got<00:04:39.980> 30k<00:04:40.390> 33<00:04:41.390> k<00:04:41.630> strength<00:04:41.960> expand<00:04:42.260> our<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:43.280> that

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
got 30k 33 k strength expand our so that

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.960 
got 30k 33 k strength expand our so that
equates<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.300> about<00:04:44.690> 400<00:04:45.260> k<00:04:45.410> mele<00:04:46.340> expand<00:04:46.790> our

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
equates to about 400 k mele expand our

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.750 
equates to about 400 k mele expand our
so<00:04:47.480> if<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:47.960> want<00:04:48.140> you<00:04:48.230> can<00:04:48.410> camp<00:04:48.740> these<00:04:48.950> or

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
so if you want you can camp these or

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.310 
so if you want you can camp these or
good<00:04:50.600> XP<00:04:51.590> rates<00:04:51.830> as<00:04:52.040> well<00:04:53.000> as<00:04:53.060> profit<00:04:53.390> I<00:04:53.570> think

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
the GP is like two or three mil an hour

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.260 
the GP is like two or three mil an hour
