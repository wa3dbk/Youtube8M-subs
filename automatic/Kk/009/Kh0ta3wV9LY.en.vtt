so<00:05:23.260> let's<00:05:23.440> do<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.590> little<00:05:23.770> loop<00:05:23.919> you<00:05:24.039> loop

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
so let's do a little loop you loop

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.320 
so let's do a little loop you loop
barrel<00:05:25.539> rolls<00:05:25.750> got<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.110> few<00:05:26.289> barrel<00:05:26.560> rolls<00:05:26.710> and
