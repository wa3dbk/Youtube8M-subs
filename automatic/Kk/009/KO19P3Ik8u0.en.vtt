00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
you get straight off from Cydia just a

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.399 
you get straight off from Cydia just a
little<00:00:56.530> straight<00:00:56.739> over<00:00:56.949> here<00:01:01.050> well<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.260> next

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
little straight over here well the next

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.590 
little straight over here well the next
one<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:02.829> called<00:01:03.069> fake<00:01:03.460> locker<00:01:06.210> usually<00:01:07.210> when

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
one is called fake locker usually when

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.280 
one is called fake locker usually when
you<00:01:07.750> jailbreak<00:01:07.960> your<00:01:08.670> idevice<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:11.140> would

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
you jailbreak your idevice you would

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.190 
you jailbreak your idevice you would
think<00:01:11.409> that<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:12.250> would<00:01:12.310> get<00:01:12.610> slower<00:01:12.969> but<00:01:13.840> this

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
think that it would get slower but this

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.209 
think that it would get slower but this
one<00:01:14.409> actually<00:01:14.439> speeds<00:01:15.189> everything<00:01:15.579> up<00:01:15.759> I<00:01:20.219> can

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
one actually speeds everything up I can

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.190 
one actually speeds everything up I can
speed<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:21.820> up<00:01:21.969> by<00:01:22.119> 10<00:01:22.360> times<00:01:22.630> as<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.930> can<00:01:23.079> see

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
speed it up by 10 times as you can see

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.240 
speed it up by 10 times as you can see
how<00:01:23.320> quick<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:24.270> everything<00:01:25.270> happens
