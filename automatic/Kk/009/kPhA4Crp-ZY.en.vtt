you<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> lot<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> performance<00:00:36.559> possibilities

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you a lot of performance possibilities

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.100 
you a lot of performance possibilities
and<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.730> also<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.860> updated<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.670> modes

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
and we also have updated with the modes

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.340 
and we also have updated with the modes
which<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.200> come<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.890> lighter<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.700> maybe

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
which are come a bit lighter so maybe

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
which are come a bit lighter so maybe
