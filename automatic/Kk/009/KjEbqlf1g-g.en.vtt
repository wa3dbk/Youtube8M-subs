you're probably gonna have oh s d which
will<00:02:05.200> give<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.490> telemetry<00:02:06.490> information<00:02:06.939> you

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
will give you telemetry information you

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.729 
will give you telemetry information you
need<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:07.630> i<00:02:07.810> wouldn't<00:02:08.079> be<00:02:08.110> too<00:02:08.200> worried<00:02:08.590> about

their new smart bus sensors yes have
they<00:02:30.370> survived<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.030> landing<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.310> Varia

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
they survived the landing so the Varia

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.910 
they survived the landing so the Varia
which<00:02:33.489> have<00:02:33.610> already<00:02:33.760> got<00:02:34.330> one<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> their<00:02:34.920> and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
which have already got one of their and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.670 
which have already got one of their and
we've<00:02:36.280> got<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.640> emptor<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> current<00:02:37.870> sensor

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
we've got the emptor the current sensor

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.509 
we've got the emptor the current sensor
the<00:02:39.160> voltage<00:02:39.640> sensor<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.780> gps<00:02:41.170> sensor

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
the voltage sensor and the gps sensor

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.770 
the voltage sensor and the gps sensor
all<00:02:42.519> good<00:02:42.790> put<00:02:43.180> those<00:02:43.300> through<00:02:43.510> their<00:02:43.630> paces

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
all good put those through their paces

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.660 
all good put those through their paces
see<00:02:44.140> how<00:02:44.230> they<00:02:44.410> work<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:45.130> looking<00:02:45.489> forward

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
see how they work really looking forward

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.380 
see how they work really looking forward
to<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
to that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.440 
to that
what<00:02:47.050> else<00:02:47.200> did<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.410> get<00:02:47.709> oh<00:02:47.860> yeah<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.209> I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
what else did I get oh yeah in here I

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.479 
what else did I get oh yeah in here I
think<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.769> new<00:02:51.330> competitor<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.569> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
think is the new competitor to the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.620 
think is the new competitor to the
Mobius<00:02:54.489> an<00:02:55.030> option<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> Mobius<00:02:56.290> another

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
Mobius an option for the Mobius another

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.300 
Mobius an option for the Mobius another
high-definition<00:02:58.630> recording<00:02:58.780> camera<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.220> I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
don't know till you test it so there you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.030 
don't know till you test it so there you
go<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:19.049> couple<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.200> things<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.620> other<00:03:20.890> might

mini quad and look these one of the
multi<00:03:32.440> star<00:03:32.680> motors<00:03:33.010> honestly<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.120> crap

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
multi star motors honestly a crap

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.720 
multi star motors honestly a crap
really<00:03:35.709> honestly<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.220> crap<00:03:36.459> they<00:03:36.579> have<00:03:36.700> a

tiny little 2 millimeter looks like a 2
millimeter<00:03:39.010> shaft<00:03:39.459> maybe<00:03:40.120> two<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.299> half

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
millimeter shaft maybe two and half

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.360 
millimeter shaft maybe two and half
Mills<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.140> been<00:03:41.260> over<00:03:41.380> hardened<00:03:41.890> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
Mills and it's been over hardened and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.830 
Mills and it's been over hardened and
haven't<00:03:42.700> tempered<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:43.390> properly<00:03:43.690> after

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
haven't tempered it properly after

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.819 
haven't tempered it properly after
they've<00:03:44.079> hardened<00:03:44.410> it's<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:44.680> very

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
they've hardened it's that's very

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.800 
they've hardened it's that's very
brittle<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.430> Barry<00:03:45.970> was<00:03:46.150> flying<00:03:46.359> this<00:03:46.600> just

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
brittle and Barry was flying this just

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.300 
brittle and Barry was flying this just
bumped<00:03:47.019> into<00:03:47.079> a<00:03:47.260> warping<00:03:47.620> there<00:03:47.950> goes<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
bumped into a warping there goes the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.000 
bumped into a warping there goes the
motor<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.690> course<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.410> can't<00:03:50.650> get<00:03:50.889> the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
motor so and of course you can't get the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.309 
motor so and of course you can't get the
remnants<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.730> motor<00:03:52.239> shaft<00:03:52.510> out<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.170> there

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
remnants of the motor shaft out of there

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.780 
remnants of the motor shaft out of there
because<00:03:53.410> it's<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.739> blind<00:03:53.950> top<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.489> there's<00:03:54.670> no

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
because it's a blind top so there's no

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.280 
because it's a blind top so there's no
way<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:54.970> going<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.150> get<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.359> out<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.930> motor

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
way you going to get that out the motor

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.710 
way you going to get that out the motor
she's<00:03:56.560> kaput<00:03:56.889> so<00:03:57.100> yeah<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.239> really<00:03:58.600> would

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
she's kaput so yeah I really would

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720 
she's kaput so yeah I really would
recommend<00:03:58.810> if<00:03:59.109> you<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.410> you're<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.620> to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
recommend if you if you're going to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.819 
recommend if you if you're going to
build<00:04:00.730> up<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:00.910> 50<00:04:01.299> mini<00:04:01.450> quad<00:04:01.600> perhaps<00:04:02.500> buying

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
build up to 50 mini quad perhaps buying

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.400 
build up to 50 mini quad perhaps buying
the<00:04:03.130> ready<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.880> go<00:04:04.030> almost<00:04:04.299> ready<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.870> go<00:04:05.019> kit

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
the ready to go almost ready to go kit

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.069 
the ready to go almost ready to go kit
is<00:04:05.620> not<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.160> best<00:04:06.340> option<00:04:06.700> because<00:04:07.060> at<00:04:07.930> the

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
is not the best option because at the

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.110 
is not the best option because at the
moment<00:04:08.109> I<00:04:08.560> think<00:04:09.010> he<00:04:09.430> hasn't<00:04:09.670> flown<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:09.940> much

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
moment I think he hasn't flown it much

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.849 
moment I think he hasn't flown it much
and<00:04:10.510> he<00:04:10.600> hasn't<00:04:10.780> had<00:04:10.840> any<00:04:10.900> bad<00:04:11.230> landings<00:04:11.709> but

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
and he hasn't had any bad landings but

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.259 
and he hasn't had any bad landings but
we've<00:04:12.160> got<00:04:12.310> one<00:04:12.459> motor<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.850> spins<00:04:12.880> freely

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
we've got one motor that spins freely

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.080 
we've got one motor that spins freely
one<00:04:13.959> that's<00:04:14.139> been<00:04:14.260> truly<00:04:14.470> oh<00:04:14.819> well<00:04:15.819> that's<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
one that's been truly oh well that's the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.150 
one that's been truly oh well that's the
one<00:04:16.209> without<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.479> shaft<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.229> one<00:04:17.410> it's

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
one without the shaft but this one it's

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.250 
one without the shaft but this one it's
also<00:04:18.489> doesn't<00:04:18.850> spin<00:04:19.389> any<00:04:19.539> near<00:04:19.750> anywhere<00:04:20.139> near

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
also doesn't spin any near anywhere near

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.350 
also doesn't spin any near anywhere near
as<00:04:20.350> freely<00:04:20.680> as<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:21.400> others<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:21.880> feel<00:04:22.090> preps

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
as freely as the others and I feel preps

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.190 
as freely as the others and I feel preps
it's<00:04:22.539> that<00:04:22.750> shaft

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
it's that shaft

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.150 
it's that shaft
maybe<00:04:23.800> it's<00:04:23.979> got<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.250> little<00:04:24.430> bit<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.669> a<00:04:24.780> pre

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
maybe it's got a little bit of a pre

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.730 
maybe it's got a little bit of a pre

fracture crisis going on this I knew is

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.710 
fracture crisis going on this I knew is
about<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.070> cheap<00:04:30.310> it's<00:04:31.000> at<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.270> cheap<00:04:31.539> and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
about the cheap it's at the cheap and
