00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
when it goes into that airfield and then

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.860 
when it goes into that airfield and then
you<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.010> jetpack<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.209> yeah<00:02:30.599> into<00:02:30.780> the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
Fox and a bag of grain on one side of

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.890 
Fox and a bag of grain on one side of
the<00:03:59.320> river<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.770> this<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.430> boat<00:04:00.840> how<00:04:01.840> do

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
the river is this you in a boat how do

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.570 
the river is this you in a boat how do
you<00:04:01.990> get<00:04:02.110> everyone<00:04:02.380> across<00:04:02.590> anyway<00:04:03.130> take<00:04:03.340> one

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
you get everyone across anyway take one

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.700 
you get everyone across anyway take one
thing<00:04:03.760> at<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> time<00:04:04.060> anything<00:04:04.780> exactly<00:04:05.110> that's

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
thing at a time anything exactly that's

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.870 
thing at a time anything exactly that's
exactly<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:07.200> math<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.440> was<00:04:08.560> trying<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:08.770> do<00:04:08.920> this

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
exactly the math I was trying to do this

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.010 
exactly the math I was trying to do this
guy's<00:04:10.090> pretty<00:04:10.300> easy<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.570> kill<00:04:10.720> though<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:10.900> can

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
guy's pretty easy to kill though you can

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.390 
guy's pretty easy to kill though you can
probably<00:04:11.200> melee<00:04:11.680> him<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.920> death<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.280> just

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
probably melee him the death and just

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.380 
probably melee him the death and just
save<00:04:12.550> some<00:04:12.730> ammo<00:04:14.370> nice<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.700> thought<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:18.390> rocket

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
save some ammo nice I thought the rocket

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.420 
save some ammo nice I thought the rocket
taking<00:04:19.720> off<00:04:19.989> or<00:04:20.380> your<00:04:20.530> ship<00:04:20.739> taking<00:04:21.100> off<00:04:21.220> was

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
taking off or your ship taking off was

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.510 
taking off or your ship taking off was
pretty<00:04:21.670> cool<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:23.650> when<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.860> find<00:04:24.100> that<00:04:24.250> ship

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
pretty cool like when you find that ship

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.730 
pretty cool like when you find that ship
I<00:04:24.670> didn't<00:04:24.880> know<00:04:24.970> what<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.330> was<00:04:25.510> at<00:04:25.960> first<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.620> was
