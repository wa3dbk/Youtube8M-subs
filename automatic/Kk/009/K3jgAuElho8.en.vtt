00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.509
 Hey 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.009
 I'm giulio aloisi responsible 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.810
 national of the love between you that 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.840
 to the association of charterers a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.059
 national level and we are gathered here in 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.730
 this manifestation because common of 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.520
 Rome through 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.740
 a resolution there then on the push of 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.240
 marine 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.960
 has imposed some rules on the 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.790
 renters that cannot be 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.190
 implemented because they are rules that 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.890
 practically and actually not 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.480
 will make 6,000 more workers work on 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.220
 rome there is a dvd aspect of criticality 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.350
 because we have a government 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.670
 that is the renzi government that is 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.730
 there is liberalization 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.350
 in anticipation on February 20 a 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.120
 bill 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.370
 precisely on the liberalization of taxis 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.110
 rental with pharmacy driver and al 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.420
 at the same time we have a mayor instead 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 which is of the same party as Renzi that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.740
 creates unemployment by prohibiting access to 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.620
 rome to rentals with driver not of 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.700
 rome this is a bit the fulcrum of the 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.430
 of the problem 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.380
 in this way 6 thousand would go home 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.080
 families that among other things only 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.390
 Roman families that is not authorizations 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.420
 of Rome but they are all entrepreneurs 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.630
 Romans and this to your advantage 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.660
 and this for the benefit of taxi drivers 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.310
 because as such has always been the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.490
 public administrations of Rome are 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.330
 we are always say subjugated by the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.330
 taxi driver lobby 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.020
 we say that we want to restore 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.350
 only lario linked by what is not there 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.970
 more 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.440
 there is no more 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.840
 because it is not the capital of illegalism 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.910
 we don't have it against anyone we want 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.890
 we only want to work to work 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.110
 low today we are here having a party 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.640
 because maybe they should leave but 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.560
 we have it with none of the money 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 lawyers can all come to work 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.470
 romaric to the lawyers the legality what 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.270
 it is gone and we are here for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.650
 demonstrate the legality in fact we are 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.560
 having a party 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.870
 if you see we are having a party for the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.049
 legality, something that no longer exists 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.049
 Hello
