00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.900
 m 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.420
 and what happens kids here we are another 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.390
 time in minecraft and good today I bring you 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 another of these constructions that serve 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.330
 to generate infinite materials and today 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.570
 touches propeller rails 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.760
 to sack you will see how this works and 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.860
 good if you are interested then then what 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.410
 we are going to see here 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.870
 now there are 3 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.870
 for which you need rails put more 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 good rails 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 but this that we have a little bit 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.040
 you have already seen at a time like this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.110
 We have come here and well if you want 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.530
 get it is super easy as you can see 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.900
 It's not much, either, so let's go 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 do it from scratch so you can see how 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:08.580
 is that we need good again 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.320
 but here sticky pistons 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.320
 propeller rails like no 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.490
 here here here and here 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.160
 and here we are going to put redstone here 1 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.690
 sorry repeaters 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.620
 here not since another one look at the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.900
 address is fundamental 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.990
 because if not then it does not work here 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.060
 we make an almost a short 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.460
 we put it here 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.430
 Y 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.610
 and that's how simple we turn off the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.760
 torch and here fundamental as you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.980
 dais is left click button button 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.750
 and right click but followed in plan as well 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.570
 and you already have it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880
 so simple forgiveness for the lab ya ya 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.290
 I say it is that this generates a lot 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.360
 delay enough latency but that's not 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.460
 I know it seems very simple to me, this is 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.869
 I also tell you another thing of which 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.310
 seen and in tutorials in English and such 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.950
 that I have not seen in Spanish so 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.590
 I take advantage and he showed it to us and so 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.080
 I translate 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.410
 and I do not expect you to be happy that I serve you or 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.870
 good or that you do what you see with that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.030
 and good to also tell you that this only 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.710
 It serves with real propellers does not work 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 with other materials or with other types 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.530
 of rails already proven and finally if it is 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.860
 a little 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.830
 a bit disappointing because I would molar 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.200
 do it with more things and such but good 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.060
 it could not be another day and with another 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.890
 construction so nothing this is a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.590
 little the subject I already tell you is built 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 super simple and super easy and up 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.220
 here the video that I do not want 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.650
 entertain them more come see you in the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.950
 next video a greeting and even the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.640
 next 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.640
 goodbye
