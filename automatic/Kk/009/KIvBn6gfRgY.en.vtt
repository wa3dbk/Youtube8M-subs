00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.249 

so<00:00:01.410> what<00:00:01.890> exactly<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.300> central<00:00:03.810> dogma<00:00:03.990> of

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so what exactly is the central dogma of

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.880 
so what exactly is the central dogma of
molecular<00:00:04.470> biology<00:00:05.810> well<00:00:06.810> really<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.740> could

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
molecular biology well really it could

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.009 
molecular biology well really it could
just<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.189> called<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.580> central<00:00:08.970> dogma<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.630> all

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
just be called the central dogma of all

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.799 
just be called the central dogma of all
of<00:00:10.260> life<00:00:10.500> because<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.550> explains<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of life because it explains how you and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.629 
of life because it explains how you and
I<00:00:12.870> take<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.290> conglomeration<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.250> genetic

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I take this conglomeration of genetic

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.550 
I take this conglomeration of genetic
information<00:00:14.910> from<00:00:15.420> each<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> our<00:00:15.900> parents<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
information from each of our parents and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
information from each of our parents and
how<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.670> information<00:00:18.240> gets<00:00:18.420> transferred

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
how this information gets transferred

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
how this information gets transferred
into<00:00:19.230> generating<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.100> full-blown<00:00:20.850> human<00:00:21.300> being

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
information or as Marshall nirenberg who

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
information or as Marshall nirenberg who
won<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> Nobel<00:00:42.270> Prize<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.510> Physiology<00:00:42.989> and

won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.880 
won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and
medicine<00:00:43.469> once<00:00:43.980> said<00:00:44.450> DNA<00:00:45.450> makes<00:00:45.930> RNA<00:00:46.050> makes

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
medicine once said DNA makes RNA makes

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.549 
medicine once said DNA makes RNA makes
protein<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.140> simple

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
protein and I think this simple

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.979 
protein and I think this simple
explanation<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.820> says<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
explanation really just says it all so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
explanation really just says it all so
let's<00:00:52.440> explore<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.920> concept<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.489> bit

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
let's explore this concept a little bit

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
let's explore this concept a little bit
further<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.809> three<00:00:55.020> major<00:00:55.199> players

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
further so we have three major players

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
further so we have three major players
here<00:00:55.980> DNA<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> RNA<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.510> nucleic<00:00:57.870> acids<00:00:58.640> which

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
here DNA and RNA are nucleic acids which

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
here DNA and RNA are nucleic acids which
are<00:00:59.850> made<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.420> nucleotides<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.910> proteins

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
are made up of nucleotides and proteins

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.560 
are made up of nucleotides and proteins
are<00:01:03.180> made<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.780> amino<00:01:04.140> acids<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.570> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
are made up of amino acids and the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.090 
are made up of amino acids and the
information<00:01:06.960> starts<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> most<00:01:07.890> basic

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
information starts at the most basic

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
information starts at the most basic
level<00:01:08.520> stored<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.000> DNA<00:01:09.450> which<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.799> be

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
level stored as DNA which can then be

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.390 
level stored as DNA which can then be
restored<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:12.240> DNA<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.229> DNA<00:01:13.530> copies<00:01:14.010> itself

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
restored as DNA when DNA copies itself

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.109 
restored as DNA when DNA copies itself
in<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.030> process<00:01:15.479> called<00:01:15.509> replication<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.700> DNA

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
in a process called replication then DNA

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
in a process called replication then DNA
can<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.330> copied<00:01:18.840> into<00:01:19.020> RNA<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.189> process

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
can be copied into RNA in a process

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.020 
can be copied into RNA in a process
called<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:21.090> transcription<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.549> then<00:01:23.549> finally

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
called a transcription and then finally

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.789 
called a transcription and then finally
you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> information<00:01:24.780> RNA<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
you can use the information RNA to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.429 
you can use the information RNA to
synthesize<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> protein<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.780> process<00:01:28.229> called

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
synthesize a protein in a process called

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.749 
synthesize a protein in a process called
translation<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.840> since<00:01:31.290> DNA<00:01:31.710> RNA<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
translation now since DNA RNA and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.899 
translation now since DNA RNA and
protein<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.689> linear<00:01:34.170> polymers<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.640> means

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
protein are linear polymers this means

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.960 
protein are linear polymers this means
that<00:01:36.210> each<00:01:36.570> individual<00:01:37.409> unit<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:38.130> monomer<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that each individual unit or monomer is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.679 
that each individual unit or monomer is
only<00:01:39.509> attached<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.259> most<00:01:40.500> two<00:01:41.009> other<00:01:41.189> units

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
only attached to at most two other units

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.530 
only attached to at most two other units
so<00:01:42.689> say<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> monomer<00:01:44.210> which<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
so say we have a monomer which is just

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.520 
so say we have a monomer which is just
one<00:01:45.780> unit<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.579> connected<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> series

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
one unit they are connected and a series

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
one unit they are connected and a series
like<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.579> makes<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.149> linear

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
like this which makes it a linear

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.889 
like this which makes it a linear
polymer<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.520> same<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.119> DNA<00:01:54.689> if

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
polymer and this is the same for DNA if

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.740 
polymer and this is the same for DNA if
each<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:56.210> deoxyribonucleic<00:01:57.210> acid

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
each of these is a deoxyribonucleic acid

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.399 
each of these is a deoxyribonucleic acid
for<00:01:58.619> RNA<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.549> ribonucleic<00:02:00.360> acid<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
for RNA if it's a ribonucleic acid or a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.160 
for RNA if it's a ribonucleic acid or a
protein<00:02:02.340> which<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.270> amino<00:02:03.630> acid<00:02:04.049> it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
protein which are just amino acid it's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.350 
protein which are just amino acid it's
all<00:02:04.290> connected<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.009> linear<00:02:05.219> polymer<00:02:05.820> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
all connected in a linear polymer so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.510 
all connected in a linear polymer so
what<00:02:06.600> does<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.840> mean<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.829> means<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
what does this mean this means that the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
what does this mean this means that the
specific<00:02:09.090> sequence<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.660> each<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.080> these

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
specific sequence of each of these

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.480 
specific sequence of each of these
monomers<00:02:10.739> effectively<00:02:11.430> encodes<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.030> for<00:02:12.270> me

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
monomers effectively encodes in for me

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.790 
monomers effectively encodes in for me
and<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.450> transfer<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.050> information<00:02:14.320> is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
and that that transfer of information is

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.750 
and that that transfer of information is

faithfully preserved from DNA to RNA to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.690 
faithfully preserved from DNA to RNA to
protein<00:02:19.390> each<00:02:20.200> Shalamar<00:02:20.950> sequence<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.670> used

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
protein each Shalamar sequence is used

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.180 
protein each Shalamar sequence is used
as<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> template<00:02:22.630> for<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.870> synthesis<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
as a template for the synthesis of the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.570 
as a template for the synthesis of the
next<00:02:24.580> polymer<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:26.500> could<00:02:26.710> go<00:02:26.950> into<00:02:27.250> any

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
next polymer and you could go into any

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.300 
next polymer and you could go into any
step<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.210> this<00:02:28.540> sequence<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.320> determine<00:02:30.160> what

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
step in this sequence and determine what

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.100 
step in this sequence and determine what
the<00:02:30.460> corresponding<00:02:30.820> polymers<00:02:31.720> would<00:02:31.930> look

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the corresponding polymers would look

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.370 
the corresponding polymers would look
like<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.220> other<00:02:33.310> words<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.820> could<00:02:33.970> take

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
like so in other words you could take

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.500 
like so in other words you could take
DNA<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.740> obviously<00:02:36.460> figure<00:02:36.910> out<00:02:37.060> what<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
DNA and obviously figure out what the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.420 
DNA and obviously figure out what the
aren't<00:02:37.900> corresponding<00:02:38.500> RNA<00:02:38.860> would<00:02:39.010> look<00:02:39.220> like

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
aren't corresponding RNA would look like

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.670 
aren't corresponding RNA would look like
and<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:40.450> what<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> corresponding<00:02:41.500> protein

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
and then what the corresponding protein

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.370 
and then what the corresponding protein
would<00:02:42.040> look<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:43.150> whole<00:02:43.420> process<00:02:43.720> is

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
would look like so this whole process is

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.670 
would look like so this whole process is
the<00:02:44.920> central<00:02:45.520> dogma<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.990> sometimes<00:02:47.260> be<00:02:47.560> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the central dogma it can sometimes be a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.590 
the central dogma it can sometimes be a
little<00:02:47.830> bit<00:02:48.250> tricky<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.850> keep<00:02:49.150> all<00:02:49.330> of<00:02:49.480> these

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
little bit tricky to keep all of these

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.870 
little bit tricky to keep all of these
terms<00:02:49.840> straight<00:02:50.350> though<00:02:50.650> I'll<00:02:51.070> try<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> break

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
terms straight though I'll try to break

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.850 
terms straight though I'll try to break
it<00:02:52.030> down<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.300> bit<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.810> how<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:53.710> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
it down a little bit for how I like to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.920 
it down a little bit for how I like to
remember<00:02:54.070> them<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:55.000> DNA<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.450> think<00:02:55.630> it's

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
remember them for DNA I think it's

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.050 
remember them for DNA I think it's
pretty<00:02:56.080> easy<00:02:56.380> when<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.770> go<00:02:56.920> from<00:02:57.130> DNA<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.880> DNA

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
pretty easy when you go from DNA and DNA

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.330 
pretty easy when you go from DNA and DNA
makes<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.570> copy<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.990> itself<00:02:59.200> it's<00:03:00.070> called

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
makes a copy of itself it's called

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.070 
makes a copy of itself it's called
replication<00:03:00.550> because<00:03:01.390> DNA<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.840> just

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
replication because DNA is just

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.200 
replication because DNA is just
replicating<00:03:02.830> itself<00:03:03.190> it's<00:03:03.400> making<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.970> same

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
replicating itself it's making the same

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.320 
replicating itself it's making the same
copy<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.750> itself<00:03:06.180> transcription<00:03:07.180> and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
copy of itself transcription and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.850 
copy of itself transcription and
translation<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.020> other<00:03:08.200> hand<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.650> kind

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
translation on the other hand it's kind

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.030 
translation on the other hand it's kind
of<00:03:08.950> easy<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.520> these<00:03:09.670> two<00:03:09.940> terms<00:03:10.120> mixed<00:03:10.600> up

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
of easy to get these two terms mixed up

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.250 
of easy to get these two terms mixed up
one<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.190> them<00:03:12.340> obviously<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.090> talking<00:03:14.020> about

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
one of them obviously is talking about

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.290 
one of them obviously is talking about
DNA<00:03:14.560> -<00:03:14.860> RNA<00:03:15.010> whereas<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.910> other<00:03:16.090> one<00:03:16.270> is

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
DNA - RNA whereas the other one is

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.330 
DNA - RNA whereas the other one is
talking<00:03:16.600> about<00:03:16.780> going<00:03:17.080> from<00:03:17.260> RNA<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:17.770> protein

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
talking about going from RNA to protein

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.690 
talking about going from RNA to protein
so<00:03:19.270> if<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.750> look<00:03:20.020> at<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.410> word<00:03:20.700> transcription

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so if you look at the word transcription

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.040 
so if you look at the word transcription
it<00:03:21.910> has<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.420> word<00:03:22.660> script<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.900> think

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
it has the word script in it so I think

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.980 
it has the word script in it so I think
of<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.440> as<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.770> from<00:03:27.160> one<00:03:27.520> written<00:03:27.940> form<00:03:28.300> to

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
of it as going from one written form to

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.350 
of it as going from one written form to
another<00:03:29.320> kind<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.710> written<00:03:30.040> form<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.670> both

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
another kind of written form and both

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.070 
another kind of written form and both
use<00:03:31.810> nucleic<00:03:32.560> acids<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.520> they<00:03:33.640> both<00:03:33.850> used<00:03:34.390> this

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
use nucleic acids so they both used this

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.910 
use nucleic acids so they both used this
sort<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.500> alphabet<00:03:36.070> if<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:36.700> will<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:37.920> nucleic

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
sort of alphabet if you will of nucleic

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.740 
sort of alphabet if you will of nucleic
acids<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:39.880> you're<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.090> going<00:03:40.330> from<00:03:40.630> one

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
acids and so you're just going from one

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.720 
acids and so you're just going from one
kind<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.440> alphabet<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.160> next<00:03:42.460> kind<00:03:42.610> of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
kind of alphabet to the next kind of

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.690 
kind of alphabet to the next kind of
alphabet<00:03:43.890> translation<00:03:44.890> on<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.220> other<00:03:45.370> hand

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
alphabet translation on the other hand

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.480 
alphabet translation on the other hand
which<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.690> also<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.350> same<00:03:47.590> term<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:47.980> we<00:03:48.250> use

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
which is also the same term that we use

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.230 
which is also the same term that we use
when<00:03:49.020> translating<00:03:50.020> one<00:03:50.260> language<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.710> another

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
when translating one language to another

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.690 
when translating one language to another
describes<00:03:52.240> going<00:03:52.840> from<00:03:53.140> nucleic<00:03:53.680> acid<00:03:54.340> to

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
describes going from nucleic acid to

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.970 
describes going from nucleic acid to
amino<00:03:54.850> acid<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:55.780> it's<00:03:55.930> like<00:03:56.050> you're<00:03:56.230> using<00:03:56.410> one

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
amino acid so it's like you're using one

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.830 
amino acid so it's like you're using one
kind<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.460> language<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.150> going<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.510> another

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
kind of language and going to another

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.260 
kind of language and going to another
kind<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.230> language<00:03:59.640> because<00:04:00.640> you're<00:04:00.970> going

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
kind of language because you're going

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.240 
kind of language because you're going
from<00:04:01.480> nucleic<00:04:01.900> acid<00:04:02.410> building<00:04:02.710> blocks<00:04:02.770> to

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
from nucleic acid building blocks to

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.390 
from nucleic acid building blocks to
amino<00:04:03.550> acid<00:04:03.970> building<00:04:04.600> blocks<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:05.830> hopefully

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
amino acid building blocks so hopefully

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.220 
amino acid building blocks so hopefully
that<00:04:06.580> helps<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:06.940> keep<00:04:07.270> these<00:04:07.510> terms<00:04:07.900> straight

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
that helps you keep these terms straight
