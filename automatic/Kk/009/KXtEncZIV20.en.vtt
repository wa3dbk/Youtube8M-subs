want you to use this as an answer but I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.770 
want you to use this as an answer but I
think<00:01:52.320> Lego<00:01:52.799> should<00:01:53.159> make<00:01:53.340> an<00:01:53.610> actual<00:01:54.119> little

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
think Lego should make an actual little

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.350 
think Lego should make an actual little
Lego<00:01:55.200> TV<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> really

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
Lego TV I think that would be a really

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
Lego TV I think that would be a really
