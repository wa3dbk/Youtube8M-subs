standard with most headphones but it's

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.400

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
big of a problem although if your neck

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.899 
big of a problem although if your neck
is<00:01:55.250> bigger<00:01:55.670> or<00:01:56.000> if<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:57.520> don't<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.729> too

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
is bigger or if you don't like too

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.539 
is bigger or if you don't like too
constricting<00:01:59.479> feeling<00:01:59.810> of<00:01:59.960> them<00:02:00.250> then<00:02:01.250> that

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
constricting feeling of them then that

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.850 
constricting feeling of them then that
might<00:02:02.000> be<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.150> problem<00:02:02.390> for<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.960> however<00:02:03.350> I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
might be a problem for you however I

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.160 
might be a problem for you however I
don't<00:02:04.640> think<00:02:04.909> it's<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.420> reason<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.900> not

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
don't think it's a reason to not

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.919 
don't think it's a reason to not
purchase<00:02:06.560> these<00:02:06.890> headphones<00:02:07.400> but<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.840> a

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
purchase these headphones but just a

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.500 
purchase these headphones but just a
little<00:02:09.019> con<00:02:09.349> there<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.879> gives<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.060> personal

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
little con there I gives it a personal

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.530 
little con there I gives it a personal
preference<00:02:11.810> thing<00:02:12.079> there<00:02:12.439> but<00:02:12.739> still<00:02:13.540> another

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
preference thing there but still another

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900 
preference thing there but still another
con<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.190> hot<00:02:16.370> out<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.819> you're

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
con is that if it's hot out and you're

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
con is that if it's hot out and you're
wearing<00:02:17.120> these

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
wearing these

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.679 
wearing these
your<00:02:18.500> ears<00:02:18.709> will<00:02:18.859> tend<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.159> sweat<00:02:19.549> which<00:02:20.299> can

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
your ears will tend to sweat which can

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.890 
your ears will tend to sweat which can
be<00:02:20.870> very<00:02:21.079> annoying<00:02:22.269> but<00:02:23.269> again<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.719> winter

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
be very annoying but again in the winter

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.440 
be very annoying but again in the winter
time<00:02:24.170> I'll<00:02:25.010> keep<00:02:25.219> it<00:02:25.340> here<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.640> very<00:02:25.849> warm<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
time I'll keep it here the very warm so

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.209 
time I'll keep it here the very warm so
I<00:02:26.480> get<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.930> win-lose<00:02:27.379> situation<00:02:27.560> right

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
I get that to win-lose situation right

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.630 
I get that to win-lose situation right
there<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.890> that's<00:02:30.890> pretty<00:02:31.040> much<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.340> for<00:02:31.489> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
there and that's pretty much it for the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.270 
there and that's pretty much it for the
pros<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.150> cons<00:02:32.329> of<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.840> comfort<00:02:33.349> they<00:02:34.159> are

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
pros and cons of the comfort they are

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.729 
pros and cons of the comfort they are
very<00:02:34.489> comfortable<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.269> love<00:02:36.230> them<00:02:36.500> wearing

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
very comfortable I love them wearing

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.379 
very comfortable I love them wearing
them<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.250> can<00:02:37.519> wear<00:02:37.639> them<00:02:37.700> for<00:02:37.849> long<00:02:38.000> periods<00:02:38.329> of

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
them I can wear them for long periods of

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.690 
them I can wear them for long periods of
time<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.829> why<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.010> gave<00:02:40.489> them<00:02:40.609> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
time and that is why I gave them a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.979 
time and that is why I gave them a
rating<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.090> 9<00:02:41.389> out<00:02:41.659> of<00:02:41.689> 10<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:43.569> yep<00:02:44.599> very

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
rating of 9 out of 10 and yep very

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.110 
rating of 9 out of 10 and yep very
comfortable<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.189> let's<00:02:46.549> move<00:02:46.639> on<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:46.939> the<00:02:47.000> next

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
comfortable so let's move on to the next

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.690 
comfortable so let's move on to the next
category<00:02:47.659> which<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.019> build<00:02:48.980> or<00:02:49.250> built

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
category which is a build or built

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.559 
category which is a build or built
design<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.480> guess<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.989> want<00:02:51.109> to<00:02:51.139> call<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:52.569> as

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
design I guess you want to call it as

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.800 
design I guess you want to call it as
you<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:53.930> see<00:02:54.139> here<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.450> made<00:02:56.659> of

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
you can see here all this is made of

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.440 
you can see here all this is made of
plastic<00:02:58.780> not<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> big<00:03:00.109> fan<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:01.299> guess<00:03:02.299> I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
plastic not a big fan of it I guess I

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.539 
plastic not a big fan of it I guess I
used<00:03:02.480> plastic<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.169> keep<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.439> price<00:03:03.650> down<00:03:03.680> that

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
used plastic to keep the price down that

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.830 
used plastic to keep the price down that
is<00:03:04.700> probably<00:03:05.000> why<00:03:05.120> they're<00:03:05.329> only<00:03:05.450> fifty

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
is probably why they're only fifty

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.559 
is probably why they're only fifty
dollars<00:03:06.579> has<00:03:07.579> I've<00:03:07.730> been<00:03:07.849> made<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.120> metal<00:03:08.389> I'm

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
dollars has I've been made of metal I'm

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.179 
dollars has I've been made of metal I'm
pretty<00:03:08.810> sure<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.139> would<00:03:09.290> have<00:03:09.319> jacked<00:03:09.829> a<00:03:09.980> price

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
pretty sure it would have jacked a price

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.580 
pretty sure it would have jacked a price
up<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.959> would<00:03:12.049> have<00:03:12.109> been<00:03:12.230> nice<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.379> have

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
up but it would have been nice to have

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.050 
up but it would have been nice to have
metal<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.159> probably<00:03:13.609> would<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:13.849> paid<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
metal I probably would have paid a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.970 
metal I probably would have paid a
little<00:03:14.209> extra<00:03:14.329> for<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.870> just<00:03:15.530> because<00:03:15.709> I'd

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
little extra for it just because I'd

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.429 
little extra for it just because I'd
feel<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.159> little<00:03:16.310> bit<00:03:16.430> more<00:03:16.489> safe<00:03:16.849> using<00:03:17.239> these

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
feel a little bit more safe using these

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.629 
feel a little bit more safe using these
especially<00:03:18.439> since<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.739> listen<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.069> music<00:03:19.189> a<00:03:19.489> lot

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
especially since I listen to music a lot

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.360 
especially since I listen to music a lot
and<00:03:19.909> I'm<00:03:20.450> sure<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:21.019> lot<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.769> other<00:03:21.949> people<00:03:22.250> do

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
and I'm sure a lot of other people do

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.170 
and I'm sure a lot of other people do
too<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.959> um<00:03:24.139> I<00:03:24.379> would<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.489> felt<00:03:25.790> such

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
too but um I would have just felt such

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.300 
too but um I would have just felt such
more<00:03:26.419> secure<00:03:26.989> had<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.829> been<00:03:27.859> metal<00:03:28.419> especially

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
more secure had it been metal especially

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.530 
more secure had it been metal especially
this<00:03:31.310> too<00:03:31.669> but<00:03:32.659> um<00:03:33.909> yeah<00:03:34.909> it's<00:03:35.120> all<00:03:35.239> plastic

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
this too but um yeah it's all plastic

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.409 
this too but um yeah it's all plastic
all<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:36.949> all<00:03:37.489> plastic<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.609> a<00:03:40.639> major<00:03:41.000> con

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
all this all plastic that is a major con

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.569 
all this all plastic that is a major con
for<00:03:41.750> me<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:42.049> major<00:03:42.379> flaw<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:42.949> design<00:03:42.979> and

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
for me a major flaw in the design and

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.050 
for me a major flaw in the design and
builds<00:03:43.909> for<00:03:44.090> me<00:03:45.220> because<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.310> use<00:03:46.579> these<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.849> lot

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
builds for me because I use these a lot

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.469 
builds for me because I use these a lot
so<00:03:47.629> they<00:03:48.530> go<00:03:48.650> through<00:03:48.859> kind<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.159> a<00:03:49.250> beating<00:03:49.579> but

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:50.479 
so they go through kind of a beating but

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.479 
so they go through kind of a beating but
um<00:03:50.629> I<00:03:50.930> guess<00:03:51.259> if<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.799> take<00:03:51.979> care<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.370> them

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
um I guess if you just take care of them

mp3 player and letting it play out
through<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.920> ears<00:06:14.530> they<00:06:15.530> do<00:06:15.680> sound<00:06:15.890> very<00:06:16.490> good

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
through the ears they do sound very good

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.750 
through the ears they do sound very good
the<00:06:17.750> bass<00:06:18.020> is<00:06:18.260> very<00:06:18.590> nice<00:06:18.830> on<00:06:19.100> it<00:06:19.280> but<00:06:19.520> it's<00:06:19.640> not

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
the bass is very nice on it but it's not

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.220 
the bass is very nice on it but it's not
overpowering<00:06:22.480> drums<00:06:23.480> and<00:06:23.660> guitars<00:06:23.960> sound

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
overpowering drums and guitars sound

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.370

very<00:06:24.560> clear<00:06:25.040> and<00:06:25.220> very<00:06:25.250> crisp<00:06:25.810> but<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:26.840> guess<00:06:27.260> it

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
very clear and very crisp but I guess it

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.950 
very clear and very crisp but I guess it
depends<00:06:27.620> on<00:06:27.710> what<00:06:27.770> music<00:06:28.160> you<00:06:28.250> listen<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.520> I

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
depends on what music you listen to I

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.380 
depends on what music you listen to I
recommend<00:06:29.960> these<00:06:30.050> for<00:06:30.110> rock<00:06:31.070> and<00:06:31.250> roll<00:06:31.430> metal

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
recommend these for rock and roll metal

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.340 
recommend these for rock and roll metal
hip<00:06:32.810> hop<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:34.660> that's<00:06:35.660> pretty<00:06:35.810> much<00:06:35.900> it<00:06:36.050> maybe

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
hip hop and that's pretty much it maybe

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.900 
hip hop and that's pretty much it maybe
I<00:06:36.590> don't<00:06:37.520> know

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
I don't know

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.750 
I don't know
techno<00:06:38.510> I<00:06:38.750> guess<00:06:39.410> I<00:06:39.680> don't<00:06:40.190> listen<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.550> that

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
techno I guess I don't listen to that

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.790 
techno I guess I don't listen to that
variety<00:06:41.240> of<00:06:41.450> music<00:06:41.870> so<00:06:42.050> I<00:06:42.080> wouldn't<00:06:42.440> be<00:06:42.590> the

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
variety of music so I wouldn't be the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.830 
variety of music so I wouldn't be the
best<00:06:42.950> to<00:06:43.130> tell<00:06:43.340> you<00:06:43.490> but<00:06:44.180> I<00:06:44.240> can<00:06:44.480> tell<00:06:44.510> you<00:06:44.750> that

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
best to tell you but I can tell you that

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.610 
best to tell you but I can tell you that
the<00:06:44.960> sound<00:06:45.200> quality

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
the sound quality

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.860 
the sound quality
very<00:06:45.949> good<00:06:46.220> especially<00:06:46.880> compared<00:06:47.540> to<00:06:47.600> the

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
very good especially compared to the

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.510 
very good especially compared to the
Beats<00:06:48.199> headphones<00:06:48.320> my<00:06:48.860> dr.<00:06:49.130> Dre<00:06:49.310> was<00:06:49.430> my

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
Beats headphones my dr. Dre was my

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.000 
Beats headphones my dr. Dre was my
friend<00:06:49.790> has<00:06:50.000> I<00:06:50.270> was<00:06:51.110> very<00:06:51.320> impressed<00:06:51.710> on<00:06:51.860> how

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
friend has I was very impressed on how

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.219 
friend has I was very impressed on how
these<00:06:52.160> sound<00:06:52.460> compared<00:06:52.940> to<00:06:53.000> them<00:06:53.210> I<00:06:53.449> thought

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
these sound compared to them I thought

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.140 
these sound compared to them I thought
to<00:06:54.440> be<00:06:54.560> to<00:06:54.740> the<00:06:54.860> bottles<00:06:55.430> of<00:06:55.490> water<00:06:55.610> but<00:06:55.940> they

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
to be to the bottles of water but they

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.060 
to be to the bottles of water but they
absolutely<00:06:56.419> do<00:06:56.810> not<00:06:57.970> these<00:06:58.970> sound<00:06:59.270> very<00:06:59.690> good

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
absolutely do not these sound very good

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.320 
absolutely do not these sound very good

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
so I'm giving them seven out of ten and

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.800 
so I'm giving them seven out of ten and
that<00:07:06.139> pretty<00:07:06.290> much<00:07:06.380> concludes<00:07:06.650> my<00:07:07.510> review<00:07:08.510> of
