hi I'm Jane I'm here from beads

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.870 
hi I'm Jane I'm here from beads
Unlimited<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.160> I'm<00:00:16.369> going<00:00:16.519> to<00:00:16.580> show<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:16.760> a

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
Unlimited and I'm going to show you a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.759 
Unlimited and I'm going to show you a
few<00:00:17.089> different<00:00:17.119> projects<00:00:17.779> today<00:00:17.929> we're

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
few different projects today we're

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.800 
few different projects today we're
mostly<00:00:19.039> using<00:00:19.369> head<00:00:19.519> pins<00:00:19.759> and<00:00:19.909> eye<00:00:20.029> pins<00:00:20.359> I'm

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
mostly using head pins and eye pins I'm

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.659 
mostly using head pins and eye pins I'm
going<00:00:21.019> to<00:00:21.079> do<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.199> charm<00:00:21.560> bracelet<00:00:22.039> now<00:00:22.339> which

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
going to do a charm bracelet now which

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.130 
going to do a charm bracelet now which
actually<00:00:22.789> just<00:00:23.119> uses<00:00:23.390> head<00:00:23.539> pins<00:00:23.810> we<00:00:23.960> don't

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
actually just uses head pins we don't

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.620 
actually just uses head pins we don't
need<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.289> pins<00:00:24.739> on<00:00:24.919> this<00:00:25.069> one<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.179> you<00:00:26.419> need<00:00:26.539> two

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
need a pins on this one so you need two

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.929 
need a pins on this one so you need two
lengths<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.929> chain<00:00:26.989> to<00:00:27.439> start<00:00:27.739> with<00:00:28.009> I<00:00:28.310> mean

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
lengths of chain to start with I mean

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.009 
lengths of chain to start with I mean
I've<00:00:29.060> got<00:00:29.179> about<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.390> quarter<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.869> meter

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
I've got about a quarter of a meter

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.960 
I've got about a quarter of a meter
there<00:00:30.199> which<00:00:30.439> is<00:00:30.589> enough<00:00:30.829> for<00:00:30.859> a<00:00:31.069> bracelet<00:00:31.489> and

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
there which is enough for a bracelet and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.170 
there which is enough for a bracelet and
as<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:32.899> say<00:00:33.140> we're<00:00:33.440> using<00:00:33.590> head<00:00:33.920> pins<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:34.910> all

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
as I say we're using head pins so all

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.869 
as I say we're using head pins so all
I'm<00:00:35.329> going<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.539> do<00:00:35.719> on<00:00:35.960> each<00:00:36.230> head<00:00:36.500> pin<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.039> pop

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
I'm going to do on each head pin is pop

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.549 
I'm going to do on each head pin is pop
one<00:00:38.480> bead<00:00:39.969> and<00:00:40.969> put<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.449> now<00:00:42.140> as<00:00:42.320> I've<00:00:42.440> done

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
one bead and put it on now as I've done

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.049 
one bead and put it on now as I've done
with<00:00:42.710> all<00:00:42.859> the<00:00:42.949> other<00:00:43.070> things<00:00:43.190> with<00:00:43.640> head<00:00:43.820> pins

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
with all the other things with head pins

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.759 
with all the other things with head pins
is<00:00:44.269> we<00:00:44.480> bend<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:44.870> over<00:00:45.199> at<00:00:45.289> right-angles

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
is we bend this over at right-angles

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.700 
is we bend this over at right-angles
first<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.780> then<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:47.870> trim<00:00:48.140> off<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:48.500> want<00:00:48.649> to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
first and then we trim off you want to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.220 
first and then we trim off you want to
save<00:00:48.920> yourself<00:00:49.039> about<00:00:49.429> a<00:00:49.489> centimeter<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.570> cut

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
save yourself about a centimeter and cut

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.799 
save yourself about a centimeter and cut
off<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.559> excess<00:00:51.980> by<00:00:52.730> bending<00:00:52.969> it<00:00:53.239> over<00:00:53.359> it

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
off the excess by bending it over it

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.660 
off the excess by bending it over it
ensures<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.230> your<00:00:54.530> loop<00:00:54.679> ends<00:00:55.039> up<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.280> top<00:00:55.489> of

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
ensures that your loop ends up on top of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.579 
ensures that your loop ends up on top of
the<00:00:55.760> bead<00:00:55.940> rather<00:00:56.329> than<00:00:56.539> offset<00:00:56.929> to<00:00:57.140> one<00:00:57.170> side

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
the bead rather than offset to one side

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.110 
the bead rather than offset to one side
which<00:00:57.859> is<00:00:57.980> what<00:00:58.100> would<00:00:58.190> happen<00:00:58.370> if<00:00:58.699> you<00:00:58.820> didn't

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
which is what would happen if you didn't

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.590 
which is what would happen if you didn't
end<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.899> first<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:01.519> I'm<00:01:01.670> going<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.879> make<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.089> loop

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
end it first so I'm going to make a loop

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.090 
end it first so I'm going to make a loop
I'm<00:01:02.659> not<00:01:02.839> going<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.050> completely<00:01:03.469> close<00:01:03.829> that

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
I'm not going to completely close that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.800 
I'm not going to completely close that
loop<00:01:04.339> I'm<00:01:04.550> going<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.790> leave<00:01:04.880> it<00:01:04.970> slightly<00:01:05.210> open

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
loop I'm going to leave it slightly open

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.230 
loop I'm going to leave it slightly open
and<00:01:06.260> then<00:01:06.740> I'm<00:01:06.860> going<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.010> hang<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:08.030> on<00:01:08.210> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
and then I'm going to hang it on the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.730 
and then I'm going to hang it on the
chain<00:01:10.720> okay<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:11.990> then<00:01:12.080> I'm<00:01:12.200> using<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.560> round

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
chain okay and then I'm using the round

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.480 
chain okay and then I'm using the round
nose<00:01:12.980> pliers<00:01:13.370> like<00:01:14.360> before<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:16.010> make<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.340> loop

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
nose pliers like before to make the loop

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.020 
nose pliers like before to make the loop
and<00:01:17.330> there<00:01:17.540> we<00:01:17.630> go<00:01:17.780> that's<00:01:17.960> your<00:01:18.080> first<00:01:18.350> bead

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
and there we go that's your first bead

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.480 
and there we go that's your first bead
another<00:01:20.030> head<00:01:20.240> pin<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:22.420> another<00:01:23.420> bead<00:01:24.490> so

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
another head pin and another bead so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.400 
another head pin and another bead so
again<00:01:25.730> end<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.780> over<00:01:28.360> cutters<00:01:29.360> cut<00:01:30.110> off<00:01:30.260> the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
again end it over cutters cut off the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.370 
again end it over cutters cut off the
excess<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:32.030> gripping<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.600> very<00:01:32.840> end<00:01:33.170> of

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
excess it's gripping the very end of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.680 
excess it's gripping the very end of
that<00:01:33.440> wire<00:01:33.800> about<00:01:34.580> halfway<00:01:34.880> down<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.420> pliers

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
that wire about halfway down the pliers

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.770 
that wire about halfway down the pliers
it's<00:01:36.650> bending<00:01:36.980> over<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.700> top<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.690> a

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it's bending over the top so it's just a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it's bending over the top so it's just a
wrist<00:01:38.990> action<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:40.250> get<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.520> loop<00:01:40.700> partly<00:01:41.150> done

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
wrist action to get the loop partly done

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.630 
wrist action to get the loop partly done
so<00:01:42.800> say<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.010> don't<00:01:43.160> want<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.400> close<00:01:43.610> it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
so say you don't want to close it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.250 
so say you don't want to close it
completely<00:01:44.270> because<00:01:44.660> you<00:01:44.870> want<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.080> hang<00:01:45.230> it

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
completely because you want to hang it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.850 
completely because you want to hang it
onto<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.710> chain<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.410> really<00:01:48.590> all

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
onto your chain and this is really all

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.300 
onto your chain and this is really all
I'm<00:01:49.040> doing<00:01:49.400> all<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.790> way<00:01:49.910> down<00:01:50.120> here<00:01:51.310> alright

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
I'm doing all the way down here alright

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.670 
I'm doing all the way down here alright
I'll<00:01:52.790> do<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.060> few<00:01:53.300> more<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.080> again<00:01:54.320> just<00:01:54.350> another

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
I'll do a few more so again just another

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.190 
I'll do a few more so again just another
bead<00:01:55.810> another<00:01:56.810> head<00:01:57.110> pin<00:01:59.830> then<00:02:00.830> die<00:02:01.040> over<00:02:02.200> cut

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
bead another head pin then die over cut

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
bead another head pin then die over cut
off<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.500> excess

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.110 

get<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.600> loot<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.319> quite<00:02:10.590> closed<00:02:14.120> hanging

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
get your loot not quite closed hanging

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.480 
get your loot not quite closed hanging
on<00:02:15.240> chain<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.040> really<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.340> as
