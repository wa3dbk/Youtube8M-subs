believe<00:00:16.640> we<00:00:17.640> basically<00:00:18.150> assumed<00:00:19.080> that

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
believe we basically assumed that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
believe we basically assumed that
Alliance<00:00:19.949> at<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> game<00:00:20.279> 1<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.880> weren't

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
Alliance at the game 1 so we weren't

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.189 
Alliance at the game 1 so we weren't
really<00:00:21.090> paying<00:00:21.330> too<00:00:21.480> much<00:00:21.570> attention<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really paying too much attention to it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.460 
really paying too much attention to it
we<00:00:23.070> knew<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.640> had<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> beat<00:00:24.230> najin<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
we knew that we had to beat najin and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
we knew that we had to beat najin and
that<00:00:25.890> would<00:00:26.010> force<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.279> three-way<00:00:26.699> tie<00:00:26.910> we're

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
that would force a three-way tie we're

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
that would force a three-way tie we're
gonna<00:00:27.990> hope<00:00:28.260> for<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> three-way<00:00:28.859> time<00:00:29.099> we're
