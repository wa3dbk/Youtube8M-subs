00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hey people today, I'll show you one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.430
 inspired version of the hairstyle the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:12.150
 nina dobrev at the people's choice 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.679
 awards born in 2014 did catch that 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.690
 Let's start with ours 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.840
 comb through and for the hairstyle in general 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.930
 So we need a comb and all 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.340
 many of the little kÃ¤mmerchen and as 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 First of all, fighting back her your hair 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.900
 Divide up in front a part and whether 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 you have this one he just jumps for 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 bayer on the hair and fight them with 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.859
 that came down a bit 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.500
 You then do the same with one 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.500
 smaller section further back, too 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.940
 then you can get the hair again 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 take it back and put it together 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.260
 with bobby pins 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.790
 you can tinker with it a bit 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.790
 you like the result 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.579
 then you take one further back 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.289
 streak so you have to watch that 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.789
 we have hair left in the front and then 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:18.110
 he takes something further on both sides 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:19.939
 behind so two big strands with these 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.390
 two strands then made one behind 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.390
 light co 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.579
 Now you take something further 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.350
 below it a small strand and 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.869
 take the two big strands 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.569
 So add a strand then right 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.920
 continue and one left and then you do 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.670
 with the two big separate again 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.670
 a knot 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.800
 then you take in again from the side 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.540
 a few hairs with a few hairs to the right 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.850
 the right strand and left a couple 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.320
 to the left beach and with the two 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 all stretch then made again 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.500
 club 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.570
 and that's what keeps her going 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.070
 but you have reached the bottom but whatever 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.990
 on which you still have a few left the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.580
 then at the front of the face 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.150
 So on the side that they have something 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.150
 leave 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.560
 when you're done with it we'll do it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.610
 continue with one side and have to 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.610
 We take the other side away 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.880
 Now we have a full streak in it 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.950
 Doing around the hand is what we do 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.810
 have just done but upwards 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.300
 that is, in the hair of the still 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.040
 left are a small strand and 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.260
 knotted then the main strand 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.790
 and you do that with the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.790
 the remaining ones are left over 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.220
 and you work on the outer strands 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.230
 you guys just go downstairs down there 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.630
 again the customers and then I take the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.850
 rest are two to also add beat 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.420
 not so many hairs and do it again 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.420
 the knot 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.450
 then I made a knot 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.129
 there it will be a little bit more 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.129
 holds better and looks cool 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.000
 and then the rest of the whirling I do so 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.690
 my fingers around and stuck with bobby 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.690
 pins stuck 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.300
 that's what it looks like 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.720
 and we do exactly the same thing 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.700
 with the other side the big strand 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.440
 before the beginning and then always a few 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.090
 take strands from the outside and always 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.860
 knot again and at the end again 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.430
 whirl around the fingers and with bobby pins 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.430
 stuck 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.260
 if your hair is a bit too loose 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.790
 then you take it to the side 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.980
 Tie that in between yours 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.069
 finger making her a little stricter 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.060
 look and then go back 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.060
 the pins stuck 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.170
 Of course you can still generally 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.460
 Wherever you go if you think 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.530
 that there are still loose 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.640
 or similar 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.780
 then it could all be a bit more 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.780
 attach at day 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.729
 other side already finished 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.940
 i would do this hairstyle right 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.169
 quickly and exactly this double again 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.730
 but this simplified version is possible 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.200
 also pretty fast as I do 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.990
 I needed it for five hours 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.580
 and looks really nice by heart and me 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.720
 Hope you liked the video and 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.350
 that one on my next video 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.350
 bye bye
