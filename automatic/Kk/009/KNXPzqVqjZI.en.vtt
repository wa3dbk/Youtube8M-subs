the cells

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.979 
the cells
that's<00:00:39.890> sulfur<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:40.940> when<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.210> hits<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.780> air

it's<00:00:47.090> much<00:00:47.210> more<00:00:47.420> intense<00:00:47.750> because<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:48.350> very

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
it's much more intense because it's very

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.130 
it's much more intense because it's very
close<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.860> your<00:00:49.129> face<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:50.480> acid<00:00:50.930> on<00:00:50.989> the

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
cutting board prevents that reaction

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.220 
cutting board prevents that reaction
from<00:00:52.730> happening<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:53.420> there'll<00:00:54.020> be<00:00:54.050> no<00:00:54.110> more

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
from happening so there'll be no more

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
just take off the peel sometimes you

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.170 
just take off the peel sometimes you
need<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.799> take<00:02:40.069> off<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> first<00:02:40.610> layer<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
onion itself and you should still have

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.240 
onion itself and you should still have
the<00:02:44.360> root<00:02:44.540> end<00:02:44.780> intact<00:02:44.959> that's<00:02:45.620> important

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the root end intact that's important

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.370 
the root end intact that's important
because<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.360> going<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.690> hold<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.019> onion

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
because it's going to hold the onion

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.800 
because it's going to hold the onion
together<00:02:48.560> while<00:02:49.040> you're<00:02:49.250> cutting<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:50.030> may

together while you're cutting it you may

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.600 
together while you're cutting it you may
need<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.140> trim<00:02:51.410> off<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> little<00:02:51.950> bit<00:02:52.099> of<00:02:52.250> brown
