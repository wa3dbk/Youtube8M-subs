00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
not just do something but so here I'm

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.010 
not just do something but so here I'm
just<00:00:47.760> starting<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> pay<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> end

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
just starting to pay in the end

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
just starting to pay in the end
and<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> e<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.820> didn't<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and the e because I didn't think that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
and the e because I didn't think that
all<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.829> when<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.039> cut

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
all first because you know when you cut

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
all first because you know when you cut
out<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.789> circles<00:00:54.420> there<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.140> there's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
out the little circles there so there's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.290 
out the little circles there so there's
a<00:00:55.620> circle<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> middle<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.640> I'm<00:00:56.820> putting

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a circle in the middle now I'm putting

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.250 
a circle in the middle now I'm putting
it<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.620> attached<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> had<00:00:59.609> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
it there so it's attached so I had to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.080 
it there so it's attached so I had to
paint<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.620> end<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.920> AFER's<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.550> convenience

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
paint the end in AFER's for convenience

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
paint the end in AFER's for convenience
sake<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.739> doing<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.159> just

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sake so that's what I'm doing I'm just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
sake so that's what I'm doing I'm just
touching<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.790> letters<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> looks<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
touching up the letters so it looks a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.920 
touching up the letters so it looks a
little<00:01:07.380> better<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.950> yeah<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> where

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
little better and yeah so this is where

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500 
little better and yeah so this is where
I<00:01:09.960> stopped<00:01:10.380> recording<00:01:10.619> okay<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.060> didn't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I stopped recording okay so I didn't

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
I stopped recording okay so I didn't
continue<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.890> exact<00:01:14.189> same<00:01:14.369> day<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
continue the the exact same day as you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.170 
continue the the exact same day as you
can<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.710> because<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.280> late<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.759> night<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
can see because it was late at night and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
can see because it was late at night and
when<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> started<00:01:18.689> recording<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.530> realized

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
when I started recording and I realized

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.410 
when I started recording and I realized
the<00:01:19.950> pain<00:01:20.100> wasn't<00:01:20.430> dry<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.000> had<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> change

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the pain wasn't dry and I had to change

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.190 
the pain wasn't dry and I had to change
the<00:01:21.630> position<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.460> stencil<00:01:24.020> because<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the position of the stencil because I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
the position of the stencil because I
kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> fit<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> whole<00:01:26.250> One<00:01:26.430> Direction<00:01:26.850> word

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
kind of fit the whole One Direction word

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.469 
kind of fit the whole One Direction word
and<00:01:28.070> within<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> pencil<00:01:29.579> case<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.390> I'm

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and within the pencil case so here I'm

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.730 
and within the pencil case so here I'm
giving<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.869> starting<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> letters

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
giving I'm starting with the letters

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
giving I'm starting with the letters
that<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:31.950> require<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.970> circle<00:01:33.240> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that don't require that little circle in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.710 
that don't require that little circle in
the<00:01:33.540> middle<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.619> started<00:01:35.159> with<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:36.450> E

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the middle and I started with I see E

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.310 
the middle and I started with I see E
and<00:01:37.229> etc<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.430> basically<00:01:39.329> we're<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.810> painting

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
letters to make it look cleaner and I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.430 
letters to make it look cleaner and I
thought<00:02:27.500> yeah<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:29.130> really<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:30.440> it's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
thought yeah that's really it and it's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840 
thought yeah that's really it and it's
actually<00:02:31.620> quite<00:02:31.860> messy<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.580> don't<00:02:32.760> really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
actually quite messy you don't really

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.729 
actually quite messy you don't really
see<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.510> actually<00:02:33.630> quite<00:02:33.870> messy<00:02:34.140> so

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
see it but it's actually quite messy so

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.070 
see it but it's actually quite messy so
over<00:02:34.920> here<00:02:35.130> I've<00:02:35.370> decided<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.060> outline<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
over here I've decided to outline the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.229 
over here I've decided to outline the
fonts<00:02:37.830> because<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.340> thought<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.849> was<00:02:38.940> really

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
fonts because I thought it was really

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.670 
fonts because I thought it was really
messy<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.900> really<00:02:40.230> wanted<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.560> be

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
messy and I really wanted it to be

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.350 
messy and I really wanted it to be
cleaner<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.610> actually<00:02:41.910> an<00:02:41.970> optional

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
cleaner so this is actually an optional

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.590 
cleaner so this is actually an optional
step<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.410> want<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
step if you want it you can do it if you

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.130 
step if you want it you can do it if you
don't<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.200> fine<00:02:46.970> but<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.209> chose<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.840> and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
don't it's fine but I chose to do it and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.410 
don't it's fine but I chose to do it and
I<00:02:49.260> actually<00:02:49.440> changed<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.950> camera<00:02:50.370> here<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:51.269> my

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
I actually changed a camera here to my

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.789 
I actually changed a camera here to my
phone<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:51.690> my<00:02:52.140> camera<00:02:52.500> didn't<00:02:52.680> have

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
phone because my camera didn't have

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.699 
phone because my camera didn't have
enough<00:02:53.160> memory<00:02:53.670> choose<00:02:54.390> continue<00:02:55.319> recording

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
enough memory choose continue recording

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.170 
enough memory choose continue recording
