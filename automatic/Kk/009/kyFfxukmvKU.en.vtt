 and now I have to find myself 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.849
 every generation besides this in 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.289
 turn 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.249
 fuel consumption depends

 threat to the gate 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.460
 tell me the victory about it 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 sector to save us go better 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 these are 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 in Kiev he is about the plans of the enterprise 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.670
 this is natural 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.930
 probably 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.360
 I rarely operator who believes that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.090
 and about 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.890
 abort then 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890
 I work in packing 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.770
 return called 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.550
 Coca Cola Baku 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.690
 but that's what they wrote 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.980
 until the end of the year 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.770
 long-term rde oao ltd gorvodokanal but 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.880
 to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.299
 it's 4 minutes from the crown it's time 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.050
 not 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.430
 further quote space 4 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.800
 just like that 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.570
 oh he he 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.480
 it can be trusted 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.750
 but by the estimate of the account failed 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
 in the statistics listened 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.640
 vodka does not arrive 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 on the field 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.540
 about 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.790
 lots of 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.640
 this year 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 don't be late 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.460
 so tass 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.320
 supposedly on this topic 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.210
 PC 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.210
 these 2010 calculations 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 here is such a rule of law 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.500
 I suggest 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 and this is something like this 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.859
 and by law it is 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.439
 and stability 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.199
 even though the heads of the dynamo 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.229
 but 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.280
 but 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
 m during ipo and therefore 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.069
 calculation of dollars but 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.159
 big 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 then it was the third time in his career 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 by their candidates now 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.589
 nobody because the city authorities 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.589
 business personal 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.439
 Moscow is all that he is also a palace cover in this 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.439
 year we started to verify the legality 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.029
 I'll raise him Tyson 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.089
 However, in Baku, Batumi addition 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.309
 they appeared 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.050
 clean up every house tsz st 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.139
 probably to buy 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.899
 and h electropop 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:08.709
 cube 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.560
 projects 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.880
 the first frames on which 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.120
 in April 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.120
 in the territory 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.659
 and offer loans for their matches 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.079
 I can not forgive earlier 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.649
 this term 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.239
 protopopov 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.619
 e 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.639
 this field is empty 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.259
 there is only able 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.620
 from hitting Europe and Asia 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.620
 as expected 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.090
 Hi Hi 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.790
 what did not lead moreover obkom 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.029
 and 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.989
 and before 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.989
 it worked for you when 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.259
 but 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.259
 however obama 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.289
 this 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.770
 in the economy it all became 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.199
 but 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.199
 Durnitsyn practice 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.409
 percent 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.759
 however kirtag writes 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.019
 in USA 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.999
 Further 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.830
 uh 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.090
 crowns areas throughout the capital of belgium 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.819
 I gave 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.819
 for the city the bomb has dropped the weather 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.819
 parade 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.969
 as told in the press service 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.969
 at the narcologist 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.360
 but I got up with us 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.840
 the finding is believed to be an inflow 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.819
 capital then the city may or 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.930
 cube guide hotels under elections 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.440
 and what will give the budget that 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.170
 but 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.170
 without a trace 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.330
 mom 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.889
 probably now according to the politician 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.039
 ex post 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.259
 Baku 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.360
 he leaves half 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.110
 how would this vehicle lecture 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.469
 I understand how I can afford it 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.810
 I got there arr separately brokers over 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.159
 peeking 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.670
 it was a year 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.670
 got a mouth 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.340
 she doesn't like the fans 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.340
 the police 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.460
 here is this and that then believe but what about I 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.870
 arms 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.870
 this is not the first 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.930
 l 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.240
 investigators 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.240
 however one nation 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.369
 hi and what did people leave something else 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.349
 equipment 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.339
 I sure that 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:11.599
 authority 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.029

 about popova 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.270
 however, then when 5 means he draws 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.089
 x 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:24.089
 by interest i 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.520
 he dissolves

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.939
 about lemons 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:43.439
 since here you have a cover 111 4 survive

 victory but if we wish sissoko 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:47.770
 often standing

 they began to talk about one hand 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:53.659
 later, as is known man 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.659
 he seems to be generally the size of this year

 so much talk about one level 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:26.779
 in the second half ever 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.779
 3 5 years election he r
