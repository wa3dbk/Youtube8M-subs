00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.370
 Years people I say here today because I have one 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.110
 We can build alone today and tomorrow could be a fully automatic 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.829
 escalator 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.829
 and yes, here you see 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.460
 to build the motto 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 that is completely normal 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.919
 later 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.260
 I'll show you now 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 I'll go back to that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 what was built 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 before 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.230
 this good 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.230
 more and then 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.640
 I can do it again 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 of it and even here by that so yes 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800
 and they're down to what everything for Montreal im need 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.290
 around 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200
 of course the pistons 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.190
 in the coat of arms it is not necessary 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 but the rest percent of the abused 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.000
 now order 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.690
 and can start 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.100
 the foundation stone 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.340
 a slope Ringier 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.320
 like Lambert 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 so and then of course, always on 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.790
 stress-free 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 when the behavior 3 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.910
 December five pieces 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.170
 he should be enough for the evening 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.140
 and yes 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 come here make the TuS Daun 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.299
 Lines are driven high so that's how it is 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.570
 also banks like that 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.630
 as if we are starting to build here on this page 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.149
 inside and straight distances 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.869
 Of course, the PID embryos still rations the PhÃ¤nomenta of which I equal 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.219
 once again 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.129
 Explanations 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.879
 So we have here now 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.779
 so this one 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.749
 actually an area blanket actually belongs here 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.749
 so now we were four 1 3 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.389
 7 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.959
 new clicks 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.220
 in each case in this field, then, that existence is otherwise known as a kick 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.219
 Jochen is supposed to do Daum is one two three 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.229
 1 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.229
 Soli also mixes second pass for Mainz 2 3 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.179
 yes and then we have here 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.399
 12345 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.189
 6 7 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.989
 and here one 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.829
 2 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.929
 3 4 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.809
 6 7 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.809
 so and therefore the number is 9 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.849
 and around 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.790
 that's about it too everything was nicely colored 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.989
 and last round 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.989
 So so 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.239
 although it would be a fatal sentence 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.139
 critical medial step 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.229
 which went down 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.229
 and check it out like you do with us now 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.910
 Follow in matters that we are building on Sebo through here 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.729
 2 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.769
 we can 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.659
 and then purely in that direction and then invited back in that direction 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.779
 Super 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.539
 No just in that direction above 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:41.999
 this direction 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.309
 and yes 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.629
 so we only have one missing here now, at least I mean 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.249
 the glades 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:55.869
 versus right 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.879
 so and the same game 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.659
 he does now 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.799
 once 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.619
 with these 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:04.799
 Kristen's 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.719
 only that he completely unnerved a tooth in Surman's advised 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.319
 what does this mean here 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.549
 2 4 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.549
 86 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.599
 yes and then we'll start with that 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.599
 so the hedgehog again as Aigner 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.020
 2 3 4 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.439
 1 2 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.960
 it fell 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.900
 with 1 2 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.870
 because a lot 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.999
 5 6 7 8 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.340
 and in parts a 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.309
 3 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.919
 4 5 6 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.520
 7 8 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520
 9 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.760
 the war then 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.779
 moved here 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.120
 to the program 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.120
 and now we'll just do it with the latter 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.529
 12 percent did not approve 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.960
 and then the two lines would work best together 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.069
 and then 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.979
 they are together to a Peter Lehmann 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.960
 and yes I have many know what I build now to recognize our own 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.659
 once again 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.400
 So a Kita race 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.379
 whether the rights of kidney stones 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.499
 comes on the stones 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.870
 3 0 to German these directions 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.319
 from the starting 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.319
 a line with a bidder who is in that direction 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.689
 and the Beatles are each up 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.539
 the fifth place 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.919
 and yes, Judaism is connected 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.990
 and she lives 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.990
 circulation 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.449
 it will take care of that 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.180
 something like 20 made
