00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.040
 hello how about how are you here is to go 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.190
 commenting on the video in which I'm going 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.430
 to teach how to install your mini items and 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.779
 good for minecraft 1.3 good if not 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.830
 you want what to do is go to the page 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.040
 of courtship in the description 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.289
 that is the mantra forum in which 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.519
 you have to go down until it supposes 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.730
 I've been with the way in 1.3 point 1 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.570
 which is the newest one that you get the 1 of 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.140
 August 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.470
 and well you give there a blog way of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:46.260
 1.11 of 3.1 and the page 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.820
 there you have to wait 5 seconds for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.400
 for advertising and that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.760
 and from there advertising will sit 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 will open the mediafire page 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.800
 buttons to be downloaded directly 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.390
 it downloads in nothing takes 2 seconds it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.970
 give to the page 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.510
 compressed winrar and you will have to give 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 run as you search 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.440
 to look for files or folders to execute 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.140
 which is the easiest and what I do 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.890
 it is always execute and you put percentage 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.320
 high percentage app 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.350
 and you give to enter 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.350
 is to open a roaming folder it is 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.540
 to make minecraft get to look 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.190
 his direct exit between the property is 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.380
 will open you property of you will have to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.510
 I grabbed mini you will lose more time like this 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.450
 it is better to give it to execute and you give it 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.030
 to the point of minecraft up 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.340
 is usually here it would be this one that has 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.800
 changes like transportation which is what 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.540
 have put in 1.3 point 1 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.900
 but I do not know what it is they know to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.630
 minecraft point but can not edit 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.110
 double crisis we have to click 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.110
 right to open with good real 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.069
 to open with winrar or winzip for the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.840
 decompressed that you have opened us this 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.179
 folder and here is very important you run 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.310
 the folder mind there you have me 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.319
 asked in other videos that follows is 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.030
 mandatory and if you do not work not 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.830
 it will be useless because if it is to stay in 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.770
 neural minecraft so you have to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.050
 delete delete 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.140
 when it's finished erase 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 if it ends it's ok you go to the folder 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.980
 another of your mini selections everything and what 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.590
 copy to minecraft bin folder 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.000
 intyre the conseco foot all that and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.560
 close all this 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.560
 and you go into minecraft 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.240
 to see if he gets me 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.240
 fuck we started well 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.500
 fuck again 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 or I'm thinking if I saw I think I'm going to 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.970
 cut and when you're in the world like this 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.540
 I'll record again 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 Let's see 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.959
 to see what the fuck happened, the black guy stayed 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.050
 what the fuck sorry for the video it 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.720
 it seems to me that the screen is sometimes the 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.920
 screen driver restarts and 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.900
 it takes 10 seconds but good 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.490
 if you want to know if I know half 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.540
 minute or a little until the end of the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.660
 video in which it will look and that or not good 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.580
 best short route and point 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.600
 short and now I come back when I'm 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.320
 got into the world worth 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.320
 until now 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.960
 Well, I'm already here in the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.840
 world 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.790
 and here you have the tumin items is here and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.880
 all things now there are three pages 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.720
 it seems instead of two if they are there 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.640
 expo things up the mother of the glass 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.580
 to the sides again look at the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.470
 network traps are new the three 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.750
 pages are encouraged added seems to be 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.750
 but a half page there is the book 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.819
 and the exhibitions in the last 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.219
 and well, it's very easy, I imagine that 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:25.900
 you will know how to use it you have to go if 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:29.800
 you already want the split or click 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.490
 steve jordan is still cute 110 I think that 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.400
 that 111 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.750
 and then you can put it up to the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.280
 left before you are a creative planet 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:44.470
 that helped the day the way and that and good 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.470
 I believe that it is already and is
