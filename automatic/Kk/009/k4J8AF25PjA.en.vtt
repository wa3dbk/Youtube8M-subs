00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
this dumb thing that sounds too musical

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.550 
this dumb thing that sounds too musical
and<00:02:28.310> don't<00:02:29.310> tell<00:02:30.030> him<00:02:30.210> what<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.110> spell

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350

get<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.370> don't<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:35.730> lawyers<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
get it and I don't think lawyers have a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.790 
get it and I don't think lawyers have a
sense<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.450> humor<00:02:36.690> anyway<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.650> probably

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
sense of humor anyway so they probably

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.560 
sense of humor anyway so they probably
won't<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.540> just

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
won't get it if you just if you just

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.540 
won't get it if you just if you just
spell<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.320> tell<00:02:40.680> him<00:02:40.770> as<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> Japanese<00:02:41.340> word

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
spell it and tell him as a Japanese word

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.640 
spell it and tell him as a Japanese word
it<00:02:41.670> doesn't<00:02:41.790> mean<00:02:42.000> anything<00:02:42.180> about<00:02:42.450> music<00:02:42.660> so

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
it doesn't mean anything about music so

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.990 
it doesn't mean anything about music so
she<00:02:43.680> did<00:02:43.950> she<00:02:44.160> called<00:02:44.400> him<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.670> left<00:02:44.730> him<00:02:44.940> a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
it's a Japanese word and she even said

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
it's a Japanese word and she even said
something<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.230> she<00:02:49.290> misinterpreted<00:02:49.740> what<00:02:50.100> I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
something like she misinterpreted what I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.220 
something like she misinterpreted what I
had<00:02:50.280> asked<00:02:50.550> she<00:02:50.730> said<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.630> Japanese<00:02:52.050> word

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
had asked she said it's a Japanese word

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.560 
had asked she said it's a Japanese word
that<00:02:52.470> literally<00:02:52.860> means<00:02:53.100> nothing<00:02:53.820> musical<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
that literally means nothing musical and

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.810 
that literally means nothing musical and
so<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> actually<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.250> became<00:02:56.520> one<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
so that actually that became one of the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790 
so that actually that became one of the
urban<00:02:57.120> legends<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> snow<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.620> some
