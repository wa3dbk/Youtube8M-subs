actually throw a couple extra ones in
there<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.629> that<00:03:35.659> just<00:03:35.959> gives<00:03:35.989> me<00:03:36.199> the

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
there so that just gives me the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.170 
there so that just gives me the
opportunity<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:37.250> throw<00:03:37.400> some<00:03:37.609> extra<00:03:37.909> ones<00:03:37.970> in

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
opportunity to throw some extra ones in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.670 
opportunity to throw some extra ones in
there<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.629> can<00:03:38.810> see<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.169> it<00:03:39.260> has<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
there but you can see that it has the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.930 
there but you can see that it has the
little<00:03:39.799> spaces<00:03:40.930> for<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.139> cupcakes<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.760> then

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
little spaces for the cupcakes and then

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.729 
little spaces for the cupcakes and then
the<00:03:44.150> lid<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:44.629> secures<00:03:45.049> on<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.590> i<00:03:45.680> can

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
the lid that secures on so that i can

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.110 
the lid that secures on so that i can
carry<00:03:46.010> them<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.400> lids<00:03:46.609> high<00:03:46.790> enough<00:03:47.090> that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
carry them in the lids high enough that

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.930 
carry them in the lids high enough that
it<00:03:47.359> can<00:03:47.449> have<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.659> decoration<00:03:48.109> on<00:03:48.379> it<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.609> I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
it can have a decoration on it and so I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.460 
it can have a decoration on it and so I
thought<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.209> was<00:03:50.479> a<00:03:50.510> great<00:03:50.629> idea<00:03:50.750> plus<00:03:51.290> I

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
thought that was a great idea plus I

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.110 
thought that was a great idea plus I
have<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.739> send<00:03:51.949> cupcakes<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.579> school<00:03:52.879> with<00:03:53.000> my

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
have to send cupcakes to school with my

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.210 
have to send cupcakes to school with my
daughter<00:03:53.150> on<00:03:53.599> her<00:03:53.780> birthday<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:54.290> week<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.799> I

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
daughter on her birthday this week and I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.479 
daughter on her birthday this week and I
thought<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.540> put<00:03:56.720> they<00:03:57.470> need<00:03:57.709> exactly<00:03:58.069> 18

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
thought I can put they need exactly 18

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.280 
thought I can put they need exactly 18
so<00:03:59.000> two<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.329> these<00:03:59.540> will<00:03:59.810> fit<00:03:59.900> eighteen

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
so two of these will fit eighteen

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.770 
so two of these will fit eighteen
cupcakes<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:01.909> send<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.209> school<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
if I don't get it back it's not a big

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.399 
if I don't get it back it's not a big
deal<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.699> then<00:04:05.090> for<00:04:05.209> cupcake<00:04:05.599> orders<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:06.199> have

their own use so I had to pick up eight

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.029 
their own use so I had to pick up eight
of<00:04:17.359> those<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.870> would<00:04:18.260> have<00:04:18.470> bought<00:04:18.590> more<00:04:18.650> if<00:04:18.949> I

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
of those I would have bought more if I

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.319 
of those I would have bought more if I
could<00:04:19.220> have<00:04:19.310> fit<00:04:19.459> more<00:04:19.609> in<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.789> cart<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.090> if<00:04:20.209> I

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
could have fit more in the cart and if I

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.510

had<00:04:20.510> more<00:04:20.720> money<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.349> i'll<00:04:21.650> probably<00:04:21.919> go<00:04:22.310> back

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
had more money and i'll probably go back
