00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.030
 the institution of the video 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.630
 the video download 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.579

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.840
 22% seconds 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 happiness something like right click 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.480
 I hope that at that time I have the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.480
 binder 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.230
 good eyes official 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.829
 other types of sugar but in this case 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.479
 there is the sugar and the other values 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.290
 are the no less quintanar this and in the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.290
 cut 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:14.070
 there are two very important things that have 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.380
 have to understand in this 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.079
 folder or this file is a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.119
 folder that come with a file for 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.119
 that the ball can be installed 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.130
 or if they were not seen they look bad 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.740
 with high zone and the second is that they must 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.440
 have the folder with the fish 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.430
 erbol 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.390
 if it enters 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.670
 m 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:50.140
 has more 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:53.280
 I have the hook 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 [Music] 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.030
 yes 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.210
 the recommended one that I would have 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.770
 1.6 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.770
 point 5.0 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:17.620
 It is very important that I 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 as a very important indicator 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.410
 and now not 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.850
 and this step comes up 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.670
 [Music] 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.709

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.030
 read here 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.100
 adverse 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.690
 and put the name you want 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.690
 I will put on the graph 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.530
 they put more and more 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.900
 i 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.629
 [Music] 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.629
 where are your folders going 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.150
 [Music] 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.900

 m 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.330
 match 2 official 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.830
 here yes 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.010
 in this case 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.010
 you have to do it 

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.199
 [Music] 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.380
 [Music] 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.430
