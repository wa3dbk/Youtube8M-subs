system<00:00:03.990> bug<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.440> really<00:00:05.250> annoying<00:00:05.520> so<00:00:06.000> I

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
system bug is really annoying so I

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.900 
system bug is really annoying so I
wanted<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> document<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:07.080> as<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:08.460> now<00:00:08.639> I'm

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
wanted to document it as of now I'm

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820 
wanted to document it as of now I'm
pretty<00:00:09.480> sure<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.080> only<00:00:10.349> works<00:00:10.559> with

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
pretty sure this only works with

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.919 
pretty sure this only works with
superior<00:00:11.429> screenshots<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.809> basically

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
superior screenshots but it basically

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.860 
superior screenshots but it basically
deletes<00:00:13.679> your<00:00:13.920> item<00:00:14.280> from<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> game<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.630> would

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
deletes your item from the game so would

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990 
deletes your item from the game so would
be<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> major<00:00:16.410> if<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.130> somehow<00:00:17.430> happened<00:00:17.910> on

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
be a major if this somehow happened on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170 
be a major if this somehow happened on
other<00:00:18.210> more<00:00:18.449> important<00:00:18.869> items<00:00:19.910> also<00:00:20.910> before

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
other more important items also before

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.269 
other more important items also before
anyone<00:00:21.689> starts<00:00:21.840> saying<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.500> should<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.920> made

something<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.409> something<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
something like that something out of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
something like that something out of
your<00:01:44.399> control<00:01:44.610> where<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.479> basically

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
your control where you have to basically

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.370 
your control where you have to basically
login<00:01:46.560> again<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:48.270> I'll<00:01:48.420> simulate<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> by

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
login again and I'll simulate this by

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.999 
login again and I'll simulate this by
logging<00:01:49.679> out<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:51.140> if<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.289> claim<00:01:52.740> your

logging out and in and if you claim your

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
logging out and in and if you claim your
secure<00:01:53.340> scream<00:01:53.549> tracking<00:01:53.909> death<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.509> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
secure scream tracking death in this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:10.580 
secure scream tracking death in this
case<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.130> save<00:01:56.549> your<00:01:56.700> shrimp<00:01:57.000> shell

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.970 

and<00:02:11.590> finally<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.610> fourth<00:02:13.120> scenario<00:02:13.890> where<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and finally the fourth scenario where it

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.190 
and finally the fourth scenario where it
gets<00:02:15.069> interesting<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> same<00:02:17.170> as

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
gets interesting it's the same as

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.960 
gets interesting it's the same as
scenario<00:02:17.739> three<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.160> die<00:02:18.400> because<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.790> the

scenario three you die because of the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.330 
scenario three you die because of the
game<00:02:19.150> crash<00:02:19.540> connection<00:02:20.260> lost<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.130> close

other items but if you die to disconnect
I<00:03:09.700> would<00:03:09.880> recommend<00:03:10.000> buying<00:03:10.480> back<00:03:10.750> from<00:03:11.019> death

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319

even<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.220> can<00:03:12.459> run<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.850> your<00:03:13.000> grave<00:03:13.709> just

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
even if you can run to your grave just

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.620 
even if you can run to your grave just
as<00:03:15.069> long<00:03:15.519> as<00:03:15.549> this<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> game<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.600> be

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
as long as this is in the game to be

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.080 
as long as this is in the game to be
safe<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.500> would<00:03:17.890> recommend<00:03:18.250> doing<00:03:18.579> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.839

I also checked again with tradable
stream<00:03:27.120> shots<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:27.660> basically<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.080> ones<00:03:28.200> you

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
stream shots so basically the ones you

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.830 
stream shots so basically the ones you
buy<00:03:28.470> from<00:03:28.530> grand<00:03:28.890> exchange<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.569> issue

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
buy from grand exchange and this issue

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.210 
buy from grand exchange and this issue
is<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.680> pertinent<00:03:32.580> but<00:03:33.569> I<00:03:33.840> did<00:03:34.349> not<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.769> like<00:03:35.069> a

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
is not pertinent but I did not do like a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.390 
is not pertinent but I did not do like a
full<00:03:35.519> test<00:03:35.819> on<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:39.830> know<00:03:40.830> this<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.190> not<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
full test on that I know this is not a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.729 
full test on that I know this is not a
major<00:03:41.700> game-breaking<00:03:42.360> bug<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.530> want

have pdms to be aware because we know

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.990

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
how hard it is to come by ancient bones

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.710 
how hard it is to come by ancient bones
