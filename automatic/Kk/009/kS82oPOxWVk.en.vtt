00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
basically it works so loaded up some

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.519 
basically it works so loaded up some
water<00:00:14.130> take<00:00:14.580> off<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.880> cover<00:00:17.900> take<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.260> of

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
water take off this cover take it out of

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:28.710 
water take off this cover take it out of
its<00:00:19.680> holster<00:00:21.710> put<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:23.010> water

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.690 

that's<00:00:29.050> enough<00:00:29.380> we<00:00:29.830> want<00:00:30.010> to<00:00:30.070> make<00:00:30.190> one<00:00:30.400> cup

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
that's enough we want to make one cup

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.800 
that's enough we want to make one cup
but<00:00:31.540> you<00:00:32.320> have<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.680> recharged<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.370> keep<00:00:33.810> making

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
but you have it recharged to keep making

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.550 
but you have it recharged to keep making
cups<00:00:35.080> behind<00:00:35.530> each<00:00:35.680> other<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:38.200> put<00:00:38.500> that<00:00:40.560> so

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
cups behind each other just put that so

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.640 
cups behind each other just put that so
that's<00:00:41.770> it<00:00:42.040> now<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:42.820> turn<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.270> on<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.780> after

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
that's it now I turn it on and after

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.080 
that's it now I turn it on and after
turning<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.370> on<00:00:48.480> takes<00:00:49.480> about<00:00:50.910> three<00:00:51.910> minutes

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
turning it on takes about three minutes

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.410 
turning it on takes about three minutes
or<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.629> get<00:00:52.900> ready<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.430> had<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.180> just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
or so to get ready but I had it on just

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.270 
or so to get ready but I had it on just
before<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.110> it's<00:00:56.559> basically<00:00:56.890> already

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
before this so it's basically already

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.979 
before this so it's basically already
ready<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.820> brew<00:00:58.030> just<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.330> save<00:00:58.510> time<00:00:58.720> but<00:00:58.870> just

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
ready to brew just to save time but just

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.510 
ready to brew just to save time but just
so<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.230> know<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.470> takes<00:01:00.070> about<00:01:00.129> three<00:01:00.400> minutes

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
so you know it takes about three minutes

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.340 
so you know it takes about three minutes
for<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.600> warm<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.900> water<00:01:02.080> through<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
for it to to warm the water through the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.880 
for it to to warm the water through the
chamber<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.879> we<00:01:03.909> open<00:01:04.330> it<00:01:04.420> up<00:01:04.540> this<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.710> how<00:01:05.740> we

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
chamber so we open it up this is how we

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.600 
chamber so we open it up this is how we
basically<00:01:06.190> load<00:01:06.490> coffee<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:09.100> Cory<00:01:09.340> takes

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
basically load coffee and the Cory takes

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.160 
basically load coffee and the Cory takes
what<00:01:09.760> are<00:01:09.850> called<00:01:10.000> K<00:01:10.180> cups<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.840> have<00:01:11.050> these

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
what are called K cups so you have these

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.940 
what are called K cups so you have these
different<00:01:11.830> little<00:01:12.510> canisters<00:01:13.510> that<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:14.140> that

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
different little canisters that you that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.230 
different little canisters that you that
you<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.250> buy<00:01:15.400> in<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.670> lot<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.850> different

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
you can buy in a lot of different

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.530 
you can buy in a lot of different
flavors<00:01:16.330> just<00:01:16.840> take<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.620> canister

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
flavors just take a canister

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.540 
flavors just take a canister
put<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.750> there<00:01:21.720> clamp<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.900> down<00:01:23.550> punctures

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
put it in there clamp it down punctures

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.039 
put it in there clamp it down punctures
a<00:01:24.580> hole<00:01:24.850> above<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.360> below<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.470> k-cup

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
a hole above and below the the k-cup

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.510 
a hole above and below the the k-cup
then<00:01:29.049> you<00:01:29.380> see<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.950> there's<00:01:30.159> three

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
then you see here that there's three

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.039 
then you see here that there's three
lights<00:01:30.729> so<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.510> can<00:01:31.659> make<00:01:31.810> three

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
lights so that you can make three

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.470 
lights so that you can make three
different<00:01:32.500> sized<00:01:32.740> cups<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.520> depending<00:01:34.420> on

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
different sized cups and depending on

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.140 
different sized cups and depending on
how<00:01:34.600> strong<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:35.050> want<00:01:35.140> your<00:01:35.260> coffee<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:37.030> can

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
how strong you want your coffee you can

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.630 
how strong you want your coffee you can
go<00:01:37.360> with<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.140> small<00:01:38.710> cup<00:01:38.950> right<00:01:39.190> now<00:01:39.310> I'm

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
go with the small cup right now I'm

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.940 
go with the small cup right now I'm
doing<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.990> pretty<00:01:40.990> strong<00:01:41.260> brew<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.740> French

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
doing a pretty strong brew it's a French

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.450 
doing a pretty strong brew it's a French
Roast<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.930> if<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.050> go<00:01:44.170> with<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> small<00:01:45.070> cup<00:01:45.310> it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
Roast so if I go with a small cup it's

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.590 
Roast so if I go with a small cup it's
gonna<00:01:45.550> be<00:01:45.670> really<00:01:45.790> strong<00:01:46.060> if<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.300> go<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.480> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
gonna be really strong if I go to the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.080 
gonna be really strong if I go to the
really<00:01:47.200> big<00:01:47.410> cup<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.370> won't<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.640> quite<00:01:49.060> as

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
really big cup and it won't be quite as

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.880 
really big cup and it won't be quite as
strong<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:50.080> determines<00:01:50.500> how<00:01:50.590> much<00:01:50.650> more

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
strong so just determines how much more

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.180 
strong so just determines how much more
water<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.310> want<00:01:51.640> me<00:01:52.240> with<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.010> I'll<00:01:54.010> put

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
the cup in I'm going to go with the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.290 
the cup in I'm going to go with the
medium<00:01:55.870> size

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
medium size

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.060 
medium size

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.339 

and<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.560> growing<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.239> that's<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.200> know
