00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
this is what we're trying to learn

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.599 
this is what we're trying to learn
something<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:20.720> that's<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.140> basic<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.800> mean

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
something like that's the basic I mean

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.920 
something like that's the basic I mean
that's<00:00:23.760> that's<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.840> to

be<00:00:25.019> using<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.980> there's<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> bunch<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
be using it for then there's a bunch of

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
be using it for then there's a bunch of
other<00:00:26.699> fancy<00:00:26.970> stuff<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.529> john

other fancy stuff but you know the john

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
other fancy stuff but you know the john
bonham<00:00:31.550> that's<00:00:32.550> basically<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> most

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
bonham that's basically the most

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.520 
bonham that's basically the most
applicable<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.320> using<00:00:34.500> fancy<00:00:34.920> footwork

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
applicable way of using fancy footwork

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.910 
applicable way of using fancy footwork
so<00:00:37.530> first<00:00:38.190> things<00:00:38.430> first<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.030> heel<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.920> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
so first things first I do heel up so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
so first things first I do heel up so
heels<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.450> might<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.780> tough<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.320> it

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
heels down it might be tough to see it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
heels down it might be tough to see it
here<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.800> right<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.610> heels<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:45.149> now

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
here but right now my heels down now

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.160 
here but right now my heels down now
it's<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.309> do<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's up I do it up some people do it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.860 
it's up I do it up some people do it
down<00:00:49.350> whatever<00:00:49.969> learn<00:00:50.969> how<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.360> both<00:00:51.539> right

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
down whatever learn how to do both right

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.490 
down whatever learn how to do both right
so<00:00:52.079> here's<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:59.270> sometimes<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.480> kick<00:01:00.989> my<00:01:01.199> foot

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so here's down sometimes I kick my foot

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
so here's down sometimes I kick my foot
out<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.890> side<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.750> basically<00:01:03.750> what

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
out the side like that basically what

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
out the side like that basically what
I'm<00:01:03.989> doing<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.000> different

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
I'm doing and it's a little different

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
I'm doing and it's a little different
every<00:01:06.510> time<00:01:06.540> especially<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:08.340> we

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
every time especially when we do when we

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
every time especially when we do when we
move<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.180> four<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.020> five<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.979> foot<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
move on to like four or five my foot is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.390 
move on to like four or five my foot is
a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.549> inconsistent<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.189> generally<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
a little inconsistent but generally for

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.190 
a little inconsistent but generally for
the<00:01:14.700> twos<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.600> doubles<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.369> one

when<00:04:48.010> I'm<00:04:48.130> applying<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:51.640> also<00:04:53.400> if<00:04:54.400> you

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
when I'm applying it but and also if you

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.570 
when I'm applying it but and also if you
remember<00:04:54.669> Roberto<00:04:55.450> Clemente<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:57.190> baseball

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
remember Roberto Clemente the baseball

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.390 
remember Roberto Clemente the baseball
player<00:04:57.850> um<00:04:58.480> I<00:04:59.400> read<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.600> he<00:05:01.600> used<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.960> have

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
player um I read that he used to have

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.790 
player um I read that he used to have
pennies<00:05:03.400> pitched<00:05:04.090> at<00:05:04.300> him<00:05:04.510> from<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.530> mound

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
pennies pitched at him from the mound

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.909 
pennies pitched at him from the mound
and<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:07.780> analogy<00:05:08.169> I'm<00:05:08.320> getting<00:05:08.620> at<00:05:08.740> is<00:05:08.890> that

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
and the analogy I'm getting at is that

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.430 
and the analogy I'm getting at is that
you<00:05:09.580> know<00:05:09.700> well<00:05:10.150> if<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.660> pitch<00:05:10.900> pennies<00:05:11.169> at

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
you know well if you pitch pennies at

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.080 
you know well if you pitch pennies at
him<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.770> he<00:05:11.860> can<00:05:12.070> see<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.610> by<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.850> time

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
him and he can see that by the time

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.700 
him and he can see that by the time
somebody<00:05:13.390> throws<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.570> baseball<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:14.410> don't<00:05:14.620> look

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
somebody throws a baseball I don't look

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.590 
somebody throws a baseball I don't look
like<00:05:14.770> watermelon<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:15.580> know<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.270> if<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.450> can

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
like watermelon you know so if you can

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.540

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
foot but when you come back to do the

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.590 
foot but when you come back to do the
tubes<00:05:20.680> it's<00:05:21.010> nothing<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:22.210> practice<00:05:27.540> now<00:05:28.540> as

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.140 

but<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.180> can<00:05:33.420> also<00:05:33.540> move<00:05:33.810> around<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.970> that's

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
but I can also move around so that's

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
but I can also move around so that's
what<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:36.300> was<00:05:36.390> saying<00:05:36.600> when<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.780> comes<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.080> the

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
what I was saying when it comes to the

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.590
