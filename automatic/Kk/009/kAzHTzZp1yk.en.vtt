00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
you can use it as a primer and then put

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.479 
you can use it as a primer and then put
your<00:02:15.299> foundation<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.230> top<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
your foundation on top of it it is a

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.309 
your foundation on top of it it is a
little<00:02:17.730> light<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.480> would<00:02:18.810> definitely<00:02:18.840> make

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
little light so I would definitely make

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.080 
little light so I would definitely make
sure<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:19.920> blend<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.459> correctly<00:02:20.879> because

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
sure that you blend it correctly because

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.059 
sure that you blend it correctly because
otherwise<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.140> more<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
otherwise you're going to have more of a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.759 
otherwise you're going to have more of a
pasty<00:02:23.519> look<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.329> i<00:02:24.659> think<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.439> great<00:02:25.650> i

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
pasty look but i think it's great i

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.099 
pasty look but i think it's great i
think<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.219> smells<00:02:26.430> good<00:02:26.849> too<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.019> a

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
think it smells good too I think it's a

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.869 
think it smells good too I think it's a
great<00:02:28.140> primer<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.159> it's<00:02:29.280> something<00:02:29.489> that

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
great primer I think it's something that

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.929 
great primer I think it's something that
you<00:02:30.150> definitely<00:02:30.629> want<00:02:31.379> to<00:02:31.439> try<00:02:31.590> up<00:02:31.859> okay<00:02:32.579> and
