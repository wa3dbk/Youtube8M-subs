that but for me it's about playing
hockey<00:03:31.269> about<00:03:32.519> getting<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.580> puck<00:03:33.790> working<00:03:34.450> my

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
hockey about getting the puck working my

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.190 
hockey about getting the puck working my
hands<00:03:35.019> being<00:03:35.739> around<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.070> net<00:03:36.250> more<00:03:37.200> skating
