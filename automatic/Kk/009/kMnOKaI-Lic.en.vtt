link below in the description and they

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
link below in the description and they
did<00:00:26.279> take<00:00:26.670> quite<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> long<00:00:27.390> time<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.050> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
did take quite a long time to do this it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
did take quite a long time to do this it
took<00:00:28.410> them<00:00:28.590> around<00:00:28.859> eight<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.609> nine<00:00:29.820> hours<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
took them around eight to nine hours to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810 
took them around eight to nine hours to
do<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.560> reason<00:00:31.679> why<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> took<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.640> little

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
do so the reason why I took so little

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
do so the reason why I took so little
time<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> only<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
time is because this is only the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.440 
time is because this is only the
exterior<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.360> boat<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.040> only<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
exterior of the boat so only the the the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660 
exterior of the boat so only the the the
sides<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.500> underneath<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> boat<00:00:41.340> on
