what's going wrong with the system in
the<00:00:56.079> case<00:00:56.289> of<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.559> Honda<00:00:56.980> we<00:00:57.460> plug<00:00:57.730> it<00:00:57.879> into

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
the case of the Honda we plug it into

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.670 
the case of the Honda we plug it into
under<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.539> cigarette<00:00:58.960> lighter<00:00:58.989> where<00:00:59.530> the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
under the cigarette lighter where the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.779 
under the cigarette lighter where the
data<00:00:59.890> port<00:01:00.219> is<00:01:01.110> right<00:01:02.110> down<00:01:02.350> in<00:01:02.559> here<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.670> it

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
data port is right down in here and it

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.130 
data port is right down in here and it
goes<00:01:03.969> then<00:01:04.780> we<00:01:04.930> put<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.229> scan<00:01:05.500> tool<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.950> data

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
goes then we put the scan tool on data

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130 
goes then we put the scan tool on data
and<00:01:08.140> watch<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.680> speed<00:01:08.979> as<00:01:09.190> we<00:01:09.340> drive<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.960> this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
and watch the speed as we drive in this

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.080 
and watch the speed as we drive in this
case<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.649> speed<00:01:11.920> stayed<00:01:12.190> at<00:01:12.340> zero<00:01:12.670> even

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
case the speed stayed at zero even

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.150 
case the speed stayed at zero even
though<00:01:13.210> we're<00:01:13.390> going<00:01:13.600> at<00:01:13.840> least<00:01:13.960> 30<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.009> when

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
though we're going at least 30 so when

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.529 
though we're going at least 30 so when
all<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> sensor<00:01:15.850> isn't<00:01:16.119> giving<00:01:16.360> any

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
all the sensor isn't giving any

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.900 
all the sensor isn't giving any
information<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.440> computer<00:01:17.679> so<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.759> this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
information to the computer so in this

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.570 
information to the computer so in this
case<00:01:19.119> we'll<00:01:19.360> replace<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.869> speed<00:01:20.110> sensor<00:01:20.580> but

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
case we'll replace the speed sensor but

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.280 
case we'll replace the speed sensor but
if<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.759> scan<00:01:22.000> tool<00:01:22.210> was<00:01:22.390> giving<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.810> miles<00:01:23.049> an

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
if the scan tool was giving the miles an

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.690 
if the scan tool was giving the miles an
hour<00:01:23.439> in<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.740> correct<00:01:24.009> speed<00:01:24.340> while<00:01:24.549> we're

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
hour in the correct speed while we're

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.200 
hour in the correct speed while we're
driving

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
driving

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.730 
driving
that<00:01:25.659> would<00:01:25.810> mean<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.110> speed<00:01:26.320> sensors

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
that would mean the speed sensors

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.649 
that would mean the speed sensors
working<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.310> probably<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:28.119> speedometer

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
working and probably the speedometer

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.590 
working and probably the speedometer
inside<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> dash<00:01:29.320> was<00:01:29.560> bad<00:01:30.270> no<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.420> case

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
inside the dash was bad no in the case

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600 
inside the dash was bad no in the case
of<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.869> Honda<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.320> speed<00:01:32.560> sensors<00:01:33.009> hidden<00:01:33.369> on

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
of the Honda the speed sensors hidden on

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.310 
of the Honda the speed sensors hidden on
the<00:01:33.759> transmission<00:01:34.240> way<00:01:34.600> under<00:01:34.930> here<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.229> we

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
the transmission way under here so we

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.899 
the transmission way under here so we
got<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.530> take<00:01:35.680> all<00:01:35.829> this<00:01:35.950> air<00:01:36.220> duct<00:01:36.490> work<00:01:36.670> out

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
got to take all this air duct work out

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.510 
got to take all this air duct work out
of<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.090> way<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.240> even<00:01:37.479> see<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.130> well<00:01:39.130> just<00:01:39.310> pull

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
of a way to even see it well just pull

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.819 
of a way to even see it well just pull
this<00:01:39.729> all<00:01:39.970> on<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.390> way<00:01:40.540> wiggle<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.650> get

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
this all on the way wiggle it and get

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.510 
this all on the way wiggle it and get
off<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.259> there's<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.560> sensor<00:01:45.040> hiding<00:01:45.400> down

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
off and there's a sensor hiding down

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.010 
off and there's a sensor hiding down
inside<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.180> engine<00:01:46.299> right<00:01:46.600> there<00:01:46.840> I've

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
inside the engine right there I've

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.200 
inside the engine right there I've
unplugged<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.590> plug<00:01:47.799> on<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.070> top<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.579> so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
unplugged the plug on the top of it so

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.100 
unplugged the plug on the top of it so
you<00:01:49.270> can<00:01:49.360> see<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:49.810> better

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
you can see it better

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.499 
you can see it better
here's<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.979> new<00:01:51.159> one<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.759> just<00:01:51.820> has<00:01:52.119> two<00:01:52.329> little

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
here's a new one it just has two little

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.410 
here's a new one it just has two little
bolts<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:52.930> take<00:01:53.140> off<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.530> pull<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.799> out<00:01:54.420> look

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
bolts you take off and pull it out look

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.260 
bolts you take off and pull it out look
out<00:01:55.770> comes<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> old<00:01:57.009> dirty<00:01:57.280> one<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.970> true<00:01:58.149> to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
out comes the old dirty one the true to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.030 
out comes the old dirty one the true to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
electrical connection and until it snaps

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.380 
electrical connection and until it snaps
well<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:12.190> case<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.549> didn't<00:02:12.790> snap<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.209> so
