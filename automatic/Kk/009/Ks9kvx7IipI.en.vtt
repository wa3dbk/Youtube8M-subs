00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it's pretty much as i mentioned i'm just

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's pretty much as i mentioned i'm just
small<00:00:33.120> tiny<00:00:33.390> animal<00:00:33.809> erasers<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.940> small

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
small tiny animal erasers and in a small

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
small tiny animal erasers and in a small
bear<00:00:36.809> case<00:00:37.320> thingy<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.960> relatively<00:00:40.410> cheap

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bear case thingy so as relatively cheap

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
bear case thingy so as relatively cheap
date<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.250> i<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> 50<00:00:42.120> count<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
date it's about i think a 50 count of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.049 
date it's about i think a 50 count of
them<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.320> i<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.309> give<00:00:44.520> these<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.730> 50

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
them so i can probably give these out 50

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
them so i can probably give these out 50
times<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.510> 14<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> bad<00:00:47.039> idea<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:48.410> yeah

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
times so 14 time not a bad idea and yeah

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
times so 14 time not a bad idea and yeah
just<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> show<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> guys<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.670> he

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
just going to show you guys what he

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.889 
just going to show you guys what he
looks<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> relatively<00:00:52.620> nice<00:00:52.920> case<00:00:53.190> on

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899
