now<00:00:18.300> there's<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> few<00:00:19.140> factors<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.859> doing<00:00:20.340> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
now there's a few factors in doing that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.359 
now there's a few factors in doing that
and<00:00:21.080> one<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> reasons<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.070> want<00:00:23.279> to

and one of the reasons that you want to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.150 
and one of the reasons that you want to
do<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.449> instance<00:00:24.920> having<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
do that I know for instance having to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740 
do that I know for instance having to
know<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.699> pro<00:00:26.849> football<00:00:27.090> players<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
know a lot of pro football players and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.410 
know a lot of pro football players and
college<00:00:28.230> football<00:00:29.010> players<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
college football players it's it's a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
college football players it's it's a
requirement<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
requirement that when you go to the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.900 
requirement that when you go to the
compound<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.820> train<00:00:34.340> they<00:00:35.340> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> look<00:00:35.790> at

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
compound and train they want to look at

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290 
compound and train they want to look at
your<00:00:36.030> speed<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.670> criterias

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
your speed and one of the the criterias

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.340 
your speed and one of the the criterias
is<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:39.629> want<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> see

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
is they want to see

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.369 
is they want to see
I<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:40.950> 225<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:42.090> far<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.390> weight<00:00:42.600> 225

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
I think it's 225 as far as weight 225

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
I think it's 225 as far as weight 225
pounds<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.980> how<00:00:44.280> many<00:00:44.430> reps<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.660> with

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
pounds and how many reps you can do with

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.209 
pounds and how many reps you can do with
that<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.500> want<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that because they want to know that

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
that because they want to know that
you're<00:00:47.340> strong<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you're strong and they want to know that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.450 
you're strong and they want to know that
you<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> endurance<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> last

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you have the endurance so you can last

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.830 
you have the endurance so you can last
the<00:00:50.730> whole<00:00:50.910> game<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the whole game and so that is one of the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
the whole game and so that is one of the
reasons<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.129> people<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.640> trying

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
reasons that a lot of people are trying

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500 
reasons that a lot of people are trying
to<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.379> reps<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.520> weight<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to get more reps with that weight so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
to get more reps with that weight so
whatever<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> weight<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.680> choose<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
whatever the weight is you choose the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.100 
whatever the weight is you choose the
weight<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.840> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
weight that you're gonna use and you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.289 
weight that you're gonna use and you
want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> increase<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.339> reps<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.119> what

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
want to increase the the reps so what

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.100 
want to increase the the reps so what
you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.360> do<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> time

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you can do is you can do it in a time

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
you can do is you can do it in a time
like<00:01:10.860> let's<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.250> give<00:01:11.460> yourself<00:01:11.820> 30<00:01:12.659> seconds

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
like let's say give yourself 30 seconds

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
like let's say give yourself 30 seconds
or<00:01:13.439> even<00:01:13.860> 20<00:01:14.159> seconds<00:01:14.580> depending<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
or even 20 seconds depending on your

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
or even 20 seconds depending on your
conditioning<00:01:15.600> let's<00:01:15.869> say<00:01:15.990> 20<00:01:16.290> seconds<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
conditioning let's say 20 seconds and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.039 
conditioning let's say 20 seconds and
you<00:01:17.130> try<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> push<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:18.000> fast<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> can

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
you try to push out as fast as you can

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.920 
you try to push out as fast as you can
with<00:01:19.229> decent<00:01:19.560> technique<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.330> feel<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.659> burn

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
with decent technique and feel that burn

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
with decent technique and feel that burn
you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> let<00:01:22.650> yourself<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.299> get<00:01:24.299> used<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
you have to let yourself get get used to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
you have to let yourself get get used to
that<00:01:24.960> burn<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:26.310> muscles<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that burn and your muscles are going to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
that burn and your muscles are going to
get<00:01:27.720> used<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.350> lactic<00:01:28.799> acid<00:01:29.220> build<00:01:29.520> up

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
get used to that lactic acid build up

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
get used to that lactic acid build up
and<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.630> conditioned

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and it's going to get more conditioned

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
and it's going to get more conditioned
because<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> reasons<00:01:33.299> that

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
because that's one of the reasons that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
because that's one of the reasons that
you<00:01:33.600> can't<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.049> many<00:01:34.229> reps<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you can't do as many reps is because you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.530 
you can't do as many reps is because you
hit<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> wall<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> lactic<00:01:36.180> acid

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
hit the wall because the lactic acid

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.340 
hit the wall because the lactic acid
build<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.340> speed<00:01:39.299> doing<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.290> way

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
build up so that speed doing it that way

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
build up so that speed doing it that way
will<00:01:40.740> definitely<00:01:41.460> help<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.600> another

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
will definitely help you can do another

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
will definitely help you can do another
technique<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.250> speed<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:45.030> fast

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
technique where the speed is not fast

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.499 
technique where the speed is not fast
but<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> speed<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> slow<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.340> go

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
but the speed is slow so you can go

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.200 
but the speed is slow so you can go
really<00:01:48.509> slow<00:01:48.810> down<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.430> really<00:01:50.430> slow<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
really slow down and really slow up and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.870 
really slow down and really slow up and
see<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.689> many<00:01:51.840> reps<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
see how many reps you can get with that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.550 
see how many reps you can get with that
you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> choose<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> certain<00:01:55.049> period<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you know and choose a certain period of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.039 
you know and choose a certain period of
time<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.950> maybe<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.060> one

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
time like maybe with that you go one

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
time like maybe with that you go one
minute<00:01:58.229> since<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.070> longer<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.850> know<00:01:59.969> slow

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
minute since it's a longer you know slow

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.530 
minute since it's a longer you know slow
movement<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> that'll<00:02:01.950> help<00:02:02.240> recruit<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> lot

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
movement and that'll help recruit a lot

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.380 
movement and that'll help recruit a lot
of<00:02:03.689> muscle<00:02:04.049> fibers<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.890> slow<00:02:05.390> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
of muscle fibers when you go slow and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.040 
of muscle fibers when you go slow and
work<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.290> endurance<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.310> another<00:02:09.239> technique

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
work your endurance so another technique

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.830 
work your endurance so another technique
would<00:02:10.560> be

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
would be

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.300 
would be
you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.230> tie<00:02:12.599> bands<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.739> know<00:02:14.860> springy

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you can tie bands like you know springy

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.449 
you can tie bands like you know springy
rubber<00:02:15.670> bands<00:02:16.150> onto<00:02:17.050> some<00:02:17.680> heavy<00:02:17.890> plates<00:02:18.250> or

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
rubber bands onto some heavy plates or

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.360 
rubber bands onto some heavy plates or
dumbbells<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.090> tie<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.709> bar<00:02:20.890> itself

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
dumbbells and tie it to the bar itself

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.850 
dumbbells and tie it to the bar itself
and<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.120> put<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.390> down<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.319> helps<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and you put it down and that helps you

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.050 
and you put it down and that helps you
get<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> explosion<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:26.560> with<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.340> bands<00:02:27.790> so

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
get the explosion with with the bands so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.610 
get the explosion with with the bands so
when<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.450> lift<00:02:28.810> up<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.140> bands<00:02:29.349> are<00:02:29.470> gonna

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
when you lift up the bands are gonna

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.890 
when you lift up the bands are gonna
stretch<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.040> make<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.280> harder<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:31.750> do

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
stretch and make it harder and you do

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.449 
stretch and make it harder and you do
that<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.349> lot<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.650> reps<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.310> when

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
that for a lot of reps and then so when

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.220 
that for a lot of reps and then so when
you<00:02:33.519> take<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> band's<00:02:34.120> off<00:02:34.269> it's<00:02:34.780> gonna<00:02:34.930> feel

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
you take the band's off it's gonna feel

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.869 
you take the band's off it's gonna feel
really<00:02:35.530> light<00:02:35.860> you'll<00:02:36.280> find<00:02:36.489> some<00:02:36.670> people

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
really light you'll find some people

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.759 
really light you'll find some people
using<00:02:37.330> chains<00:02:38.110> also<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.860> some<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.040> these

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
using chains also in some of these

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.650 
using chains also in some of these
CrossFit<00:02:41.769> type<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.250> facilities<00:02:43.180> where<00:02:43.450> power

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
CrossFit type of facilities where power

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.400 
CrossFit type of facilities where power
lifters<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.260> stuff<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.140> can

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
lifters and stuff do that so you can

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.680 
lifters and stuff do that so you can
have<00:02:47.560> chains<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.280> acts<00:02:48.519> just<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.880> bands<00:02:49.269> but

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
have chains and acts just like bands but

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.229 
have chains and acts just like bands but
it's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.870> little<00:02:50.019> bit<00:02:50.110> more<00:02:50.349> even<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:51.239> a

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
it's a little bit more even of a

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.210 
it's a little bit more even of a
resistance<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.380> resistance<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:54.010> going<00:02:54.069> to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
resistance the resistance is going to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.229 
resistance the resistance is going to
get<00:02:54.400> heavier<00:02:54.790> on<00:02:55.000> top<00:02:55.360> rather<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:57.250> know<00:02:57.400> then

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
get heavier on top rather you know then

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.960 
get heavier on top rather you know then
just<00:02:58.959> doing<00:02:59.319> without<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.040> chains<00:03:00.459> where<00:03:00.819> it's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
just doing without the chains where it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.850 
just doing without the chains where it's
just<00:03:01.120> even<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.900> you're<00:03:02.079> gonna<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.379> stronger

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
just even so you're gonna get stronger

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.160 
just even so you're gonna get stronger
and<00:03:03.280> you're<00:03:03.879> gonna<00:03:03.970> feel<00:03:04.329> more<00:03:04.599> explosive

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
and you're gonna feel more explosive

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.589 
and you're gonna feel more explosive
without<00:03:05.980> using<00:03:06.489> them<00:03:06.670> when<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.150> go<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.329> get

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
without using them when you go to get

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.550 
without using them when you go to get
your<00:03:07.660> repetitions<00:03:08.650> for<00:03:09.959> weight<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.440> know
