eliminates a wedging of your trucks with
the<00:00:55.949> rocker<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.820> also<00:00:57.090> gives<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> lower

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the rocker and also gives you a lower

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
the rocker and also gives you a lower
ride<00:00:58.109> height<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.710> these<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.309> will

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
ride height and with these you will

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.860 
ride height and with these you will
definitely<00:00:59.699> need<00:00:59.940> some<00:01:00.180> nice<00:01:00.329> wheel<00:01:00.629> wells

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
definitely need some nice wheel wells

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.990 
definitely need some nice wheel wells
which<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.199> board<00:01:01.500> provides<00:01:01.890> they're<00:01:02.760> pretty

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
which this board provides they're pretty

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.560 
which this board provides they're pretty
deep<00:01:03.180> I'd<00:01:03.420> say<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.670> quarter<00:01:05.670> inch<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
deep I'd say about a quarter inch you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
deep I'd say about a quarter inch you
can<00:01:06.720> run<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.229> size<00:01:07.590> wheel<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:09.000> tried

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
can run any size wheel that I've tried

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
can run any size wheel that I've tried
so<00:01:09.570> far<00:01:09.600> against<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.200> definitely<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> 74

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so far against it's definitely a 74

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
so far against it's definitely a 74

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
a lot of you're probably wondering about

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.819 
a lot of you're probably wondering about
the<00:01:37.140> concave<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.729> said<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.530> 0.55<00:01:40.530> which

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the concave like I said it's 0.55 which

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
the concave like I said it's 0.55 which
is<00:01:40.950> different<00:01:41.310> from<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.700> their<00:01:41.820> comment

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
is different from all of their comment

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.679 
is different from all of their comment
boards<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:43.790> about<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> quarter<00:01:45.270> inch<00:01:45.299> less

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
boards it's about a quarter inch less

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.609 
boards it's about a quarter inch less
than<00:01:46.020> their<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:47.149> production<00:01:48.149> models<00:01:48.619> which

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
than their other production models which

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.600 
than their other production models which
I<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:51.000> mind<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.310> used

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I don't really mind but if you're used

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
I don't really mind but if you're used
to<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.390> aggressive<00:01:54.990> concave

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to really aggressive concave

to really aggressive concave
you<00:01:56.790> probably<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:57.659> some<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
you probably would take some time in the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.560 
you probably would take some time in the
east

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.520 
east
I<00:01:58.630> know<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.990> did<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.750> rocker<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.380> it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
I know I did and the rocker I like it

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.590 
I know I did and the rocker I like it
better<00:02:02.680> because<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.760> board<00:02:03.940> symmetrical<00:02:04.510> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
better because the board symmetrical it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.030 
better because the board symmetrical it
would<00:02:04.720> make<00:02:04.930> no<00:02:04.960> sense<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.740> direction

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
would make no sense to have a direction
