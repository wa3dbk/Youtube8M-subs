just<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> idea<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:03.589> having<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.920> files

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
just the idea of having your files

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
just the idea of having your files
automatically<00:01:06.060> they're<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.659> having<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
automatically they're not having to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
automatically they're not having to
import<00:01:07.560> them<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.010> mean<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.760> sounds

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
all right so here we go this is my new

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
all right so here we go this is my new
machine<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> only<00:01:19.409> thing<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
machine so the only thing that this is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
machine so the only thing that this is
missing<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.880> am<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.810> upset<00:01:22.140> about

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
missing that I am a little upset about

missing that I am a little upset about
is<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.040> no<00:01:23.189> camera<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.180> be

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is that there is no camera it would be

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
is that there is no camera it would be
nice<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.659> had<00:01:24.720> an<00:01:24.900> HD<00:01:25.229> webcam<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
nice if it had an HD webcam so I can

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
nice if it had an HD webcam so I can
kind<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> side<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.390> people<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.409> have

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
my own extra whip em without so I guess

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.249 
my own extra whip em without so I guess
I'll<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.600> thing<00:01:33.840> so

can't remember exactly on that just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.280 
can't remember exactly on that just
check<00:01:53.540> out<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> box

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
check out the box

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.090 
check out the box
it's<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.540> i5<00:01:57.340> 2505<00:01:58.340> M<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.229> behind

it's the i5 2505 M so that is the behind

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.910

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.979 
the core i5 but the big difference is is
that<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.070> mine<00:02:22.370> I'm<00:02:23.330> going<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> be<00:02:23.720> seeing

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
that with mine I'm going to be seeing

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.530 
that with mine I'm going to be seeing
really<00:02:24.350> good<00:02:24.440> battery<00:02:24.860> life<00:02:24.890> now<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.790> did

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
really good battery life now I did

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.370 
really good battery life now I did
opt<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.880> 9<00:02:29.030> cell<00:02:29.300> batteries<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.230> make

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
opt for the 9 cell batteries we can make

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.449 
opt for the 9 cell batteries we can make
my<00:02:30.530> unit<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.950> little<00:02:31.220> bit<00:02:31.340> heavier<00:02:31.840> um<00:02:32.840> but

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
my unit a little bit heavier um but

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.970 
my unit a little bit heavier um but
whatever<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.700> don't<00:02:35.030> really<00:02:35.180> care<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.860> going

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
whatever I don't really care it's going

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.290 
whatever I don't really care it's going
to<00:02:37.040> make<00:02:37.190> all<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.370> difference<00:02:37.820> when<00:02:37.910> I'm<00:02:38.120> when

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
to make all the difference when I'm when

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.600 
to make all the difference when I'm when
I'm<00:02:38.390> out<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.230> show<00:02:39.350> floor<00:02:39.650> anything<00:02:40.040> so

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
I'm out on the show floor anything so

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.590 
I'm out on the show floor anything so
that's<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.420> 7<00:02:42.260> point<00:02:42.620> 7<00:02:42.770> 4<00:02:43.310> amp<00:02:43.550> ere's<00:02:43.850> or<00:02:44.150> 11

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that's a 7 point 7 4 amp ere's or 11

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.759 
that's a 7 point 7 4 amp ere's or 11
point<00:02:45.290> 1<00:02:45.500> volt<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.570> 9<00:02:48.080> cell<00:02:48.410> battery

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
point 1 volt so this is a 9 cell battery

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.640 
point 1 volt so this is a 9 cell battery
very<00:02:49.430> big<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:50.570> we<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.500> will

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
very big so if we put that in we will

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.370 
very big so if we put that in we will
see<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.100> will<00:02:52.130> have<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.640> battery<00:02:52.940> bump<00:02:53.380> on

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
see that I will have the battery bump on

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.890 
see that I will have the battery bump on
the<00:02:54.560> back<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:59.410> I<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.440> ordered<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.190> splice

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
the back and I have ordered the splice

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.539 
the back and I have ordered the splice
so<00:03:02.900> there<00:03:03.049> is<00:03:03.170> actually<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.560> 9<00:03:03.799> cell<00:03:04.100> splice

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
so there is actually a 9 cell splice

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.570 
so there is actually a 9 cell splice
that<00:03:04.910> fits<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.570> bottom<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:07.130> unit

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
that fits on to the bottom of this unit

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.539 
that fits on to the bottom of this unit
but<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.840> back<00:03:09.110> order<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.709> when<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.370> head

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
but it's on back order and when I head

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.400 
but it's on back order and when I head
to<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.670> miko<00:03:10.970> conference<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.660> san<00:03:11.900> francisco

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
to the miko conference in san francisco

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.470 
to the miko conference in san francisco
i<00:03:12.440> will<00:03:12.739> be<00:03:12.829> picking<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.160> up<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.299> does

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
i will be picking that up so this does

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.800 
i will be picking that up so this does
make<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.780> about<00:03:15.910> 4.5<00:03:16.910> pounds<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.450> think<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:17.720> I

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
make it about 4.5 pounds I think if I

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.660 
make it about 4.5 pounds I think if I
remember<00:03:18.110> right<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:19.070> if<00:03:19.160> we<00:03:19.250> check<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.549> out

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
remember right but if we check it out

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.870 
remember right but if we check it out
it's<00:03:19.940> got<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.269> matte<00:03:20.450> screen<00:03:20.750> which<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.350> great

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
it's got the matte screen which is great

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.500 
it's got the matte screen which is great
great<00:03:23.049> for<00:03:24.049> traveling<00:03:24.860> around<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.489> opted<00:03:26.209> for<00:03:26.239> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
great for traveling around I opted for a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.750 
great for traveling around I opted for a
note<00:03:26.720> no<00:03:26.959> fingerprint<00:03:27.440> scanner<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.950> got<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.479

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
hard drive which I probably will be

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.670 
hard drive which I probably will be
swapping<00:03:40.340> out<00:03:40.640> for<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:42.190> SSD<00:03:43.190> um

swapping out for a SSD um

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.589 
swapping out for a SSD um
we'll<00:03:44.769> see<00:03:44.980> we'll<00:03:45.250> see<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.519> wasn't<00:03:45.909> there<00:03:46.090> if

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
we'll see we'll see that wasn't there if

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.569 
we'll see we'll see that wasn't there if
we<00:03:46.659> take<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.870> look<00:03:46.959> at<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.170> keyboard<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.739> has<00:03:47.980> it

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
we take a look at the keyboard it has it

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.929 
we take a look at the keyboard it has it
has<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:49.150> great<00:03:49.860> great<00:03:50.860> Lenovo<00:03:51.519> keyboard

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
has the great great Lenovo keyboard

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.970 
has the great great Lenovo keyboard
which<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.239> why<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.420> got<00:03:52.659> this<00:03:52.840> I'm<00:03:53.560> not<00:03:53.739> really<00:03:53.860> a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
which is why I got this I'm not really a

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.190 
which is why I got this I'm not really a
fan<00:03:54.189> of<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.430> nipple<00:03:55.000> but<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.540> mean<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> guess<00:03:56.049> we

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
fan of the nipple but I mean I guess we

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.319 
fan of the nipple but I mean I guess we
will<00:03:56.319> see<00:03:56.379> because<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.950> chart<00:03:57.220> pad<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.640> much

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
will see because this chart pad is much

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.170 
will see because this chart pad is much
smaller<00:03:58.780> than<00:03:59.230> what<00:03:59.439> I'm<00:03:59.560> used<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.970> my

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
smaller than what I'm used to on my

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.059 
smaller than what I'm used to on my
macbook<00:04:01.569> pro<00:04:01.599> so<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.439> is<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:02.859> probably

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
macbook pro so this is this is probably

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.250 
macbook pro so this is this is probably
to<00:04:03.310> be<00:04:03.430> with<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.640> biggest<00:04:03.939> adjustment<00:04:04.480> from

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
to be with the biggest adjustment from

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.699 
to be with the biggest adjustment from
me<00:04:05.470> moving<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.890> Mac<00:04:06.099> to<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.420> think<00:04:07.720> pad<00:04:07.959> but<00:04:08.680> I

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
me moving a Mac to this think pad but I

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.270 
me moving a Mac to this think pad but I
do<00:04:08.829> love<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:10.560> 12.5<00:04:11.560> inch<00:04:11.739> form<00:04:11.950> factor<00:04:12.010> is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
do love the 12.5 inch form factor is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.149 
do love the 12.5 inch form factor is
gonna<00:04:12.670> make<00:04:12.790> it's<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.239> lot<00:04:13.510> more<00:04:13.750> portable<00:04:14.319> the

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
gonna make it's a lot more portable the

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.069 
gonna make it's a lot more portable the
weight<00:04:15.370> wise<00:04:15.609> with<00:04:15.939> the<00:04:16.060> 9<00:04:16.239> with<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.660> 9<00:04:16.870> volt

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
weight wise with the 9 with the 9 volt

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.979 
weight wise with the 9 with the 9 volt
battery<00:04:17.350> probably<00:04:17.889> will<00:04:18.100> make<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:19.479> little

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
battery probably will make it a little

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.010 
battery probably will make it a little
more<00:04:20.850> around<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.030> same<00:04:22.210> weight<00:04:22.389> with<00:04:22.600> my<00:04:22.780> Mac

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
more around the same weight with my Mac

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.300 
more around the same weight with my Mac
so<00:04:23.889> if<00:04:23.919> we<00:04:24.130> take<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.310> walk<00:04:24.490> around<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:24.940> system

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
so if we take a walk around the system

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.860 
so if we take a walk around the system
you<00:04:27.310> see<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.669> bump<00:04:27.880> with<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.330> back<00:04:28.479> because<00:04:28.720> I

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
you see the bump with the back because I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.420 
you see the bump with the back because I
got<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.110> 9<00:04:29.289> cell<00:04:29.530> phone<00:04:29.740> at<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.919> 6<00:04:30.130> cell<00:04:30.310> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
got the 9 cell phone at the 6 cell that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.909 
got the 9 cell phone at the 6 cell that
would<00:04:30.520> be<00:04:30.639> that<00:04:30.820> would<00:04:30.910> be<00:04:30.970> flush<00:04:31.740> here<00:04:32.740> we've

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
would be that would be flush here we've

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.029 
would be that would be flush here we've
got<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.250> PSU<00:04:33.699> we<00:04:33.970> have<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.120> fan<00:04:34.650> more<00:04:35.650> venting

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
got the PSU we have a fan more venting

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.830 
got the PSU we have a fan more venting
which<00:04:36.310> is<00:04:36.460> good<00:04:36.669> because<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.180> hindquarter<00:04:37.660> 5

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
which is good because the hindquarter 5

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.020 
which is good because the hindquarter 5
will<00:04:38.020> get<00:04:38.139> hot<00:04:38.349> this<00:04:38.889> is<00:04:39.070> available<00:04:39.250> in<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.789> core

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
will get hot this is available in a core

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.749 
will get hot this is available in a core
i7<00:04:40.150> but<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.110> low-end<00:04:41.410> core<00:04:41.620> i7<00:04:42.039> which

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
i7 but it is the low-end core i7 which

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.210 
i7 but it is the low-end core i7 which
will<00:04:43.120> generate<00:04:43.479> way<00:04:43.720> more<00:04:43.960> heat<00:04:44.139> issues<00:04:44.470> so

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
will generate way more heat issues so

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.870 
will generate way more heat issues so
here<00:04:45.370> we<00:04:45.460> have<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.610> USB<00:04:45.820> 2.0<00:04:46.539> here's<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.080> VGA

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
here we have a USB 2.0 here's the VGA

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.439 
here we have a USB 2.0 here's the VGA
that<00:04:48.880> looks<00:04:49.330> like<00:04:49.800> seda<00:04:51.120> then<00:04:52.120> we<00:04:52.240> have

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
that looks like seda then we have

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.100 
that looks like seda then we have
another<00:04:52.660> USB<00:04:52.990> that's<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.280> monitor<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.990> would

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
another USB that's a monitor that would

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.240 
another USB that's a monitor that would
be<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.410> PCI<00:04:56.830> Express<00:04:58.710> around<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.800> front<00:05:00.130> we

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
be the PCI Express around the front we

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.149 
be the PCI Express around the front we
have<00:05:00.280> two<00:05:00.729> speakers<00:05:01.090> on<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.389> bottom<00:05:02.159> this

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
have two speakers on the bottom this

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.719 
have two speakers on the bottom this
would<00:05:03.340> be<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.820> think<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.240> latches<00:05:04.930> for<00:05:05.199> the

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
would be I think the latches for the

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.339 
would be I think the latches for the
battery<00:05:06.729> dock<00:05:07.030> which<00:05:07.599> you<00:05:07.780> see<00:05:07.990> there<00:05:08.139> would

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
battery dock which you see there would

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.240 
battery dock which you see there would
be<00:05:08.789> where<00:05:09.789> that<00:05:09.940> would<00:05:10.090> fit<00:05:10.389> in<00:05:10.949> around<00:05:11.949> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
be where that would fit in around the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.200 
be where that would fit in around the
other<00:05:12.310> side<00:05:12.400> we<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:14.070> card<00:05:15.070> reader<00:05:15.210> now

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
other side we have a card reader now

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.080 
other side we have a card reader now
that<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.510> yellow<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:18.070> that<00:05:18.190> might<00:05:18.460> be<00:05:18.639> USB

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
that is a yellow so that might be USB

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.620 
that is a yellow so that might be USB
3.0<00:05:19.900> that's<00:05:20.740> usually<00:05:21.099> blue<00:05:21.479> what's<00:05:22.479> looking

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
3.0 that's usually blue what's looking

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.379 
3.0 that's usually blue what's looking
to<00:05:22.900> see<00:05:23.080> why<00:05:23.229> exactly<00:05:23.500> that

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
to see why exactly that

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.850 
to see why exactly that

basically pcso
fairly<00:05:58.910> small<00:06:00.190> I've<00:06:01.190> seen<00:06:01.430> smaller<00:06:01.760> but<00:06:02.060> I

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
fairly small I've seen smaller but I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.620 
fairly small I've seen smaller but I
guess<00:06:02.270> I<00:06:02.420> am<00:06:02.540> used<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:02.870> netbook<00:06:04.330> PSC<00:06:05.330> of<00:06:05.450> it

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
guess I am used to a netbook PSC of it

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.600 
guess I am used to a netbook PSC of it
regardless<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.530> could<00:06:06.710> be<00:06:06.800> a<00:06:06.980> little

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
regardless that could be a little

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.840 
regardless that could be a little
smaller<00:06:07.880> um<00:06:09.040> yes<00:06:10.040> we<00:06:10.160> put<00:06:10.370> that<00:06:10.550> there

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
smaller um yes we put that there

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.800 
smaller um yes we put that there
and<00:06:12.040> it<00:06:13.040> actually<00:06:13.190> appears<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.790> be<00:06:13.880> it<00:06:14.030> so<00:06:14.450> all

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
and it actually appears to be it so all

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.740 
and it actually appears to be it so all
I<00:06:14.840> really<00:06:15.110> got<00:06:15.200> was<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.620> battery<00:06:15.800> and<00:06:16.750> my
