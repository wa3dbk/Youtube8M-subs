crate<00:00:06.680> we'll<00:00:07.680> start<00:00:07.980> off<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.519> top

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
crate we'll start off with the top

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.410 
crate we'll start off with the top
section<00:00:09.860> you'll<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.980> using<00:00:11.280> four<00:00:11.580> eight<00:00:12.059> rail

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
section you'll be using four eight rail

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.770 
section you'll be using four eight rail
sections<00:00:13.759> the<00:00:14.759> best<00:00:14.940> way<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> start<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
sections the best way to start is to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.590 
sections the best way to start is to
install<00:00:16.400> two<00:00:17.400> long<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.029> short<00:00:18.390> rail

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
install two long in one short rail

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.540 
install two long in one short rail
sections<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.410> we're<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> line<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
sections so we're going to line up the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
sections so we're going to line up the
flat<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.359> Flying<00:00:21.689> H<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.080> top<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
flat with the Flying H on top here and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.480 
flat with the Flying H on top here and
push<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.880> firmly<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.400> we're<00:00:26.400> going

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
push it in firmly and then we're going

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:52.369 
push it in firmly and then we're going
to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:26.970> short<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:51.379> three

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to do one short so now we have three

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.930 
to do one short so now we have three
sides<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> build<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> other

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
sides we're going to build the other

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.529 
sides we're going to build the other
side<00:00:59.600> once<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.260> two<00:01:01.440> parts

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
side once you get the two parts

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.980 
side once you get the two parts
assembled<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.870> lay<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.680> down<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.990> use

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
assembled you can lay this down and use

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.010 
assembled you can lay this down and use
the<00:01:07.350> table<00:01:07.970> or<00:01:08.970> whatever<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.420> workspace<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the table or whatever your workspace is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
the table or whatever your workspace is
to<00:01:11.270> line<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.570> four<00:01:12.840> sections<00:01:15.590> give<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to line up all four sections give them a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.660 
to line up all four sections give them a
nice<00:01:16.979> hard<00:01:17.280> push<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.119> may<00:01:18.270> need<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.630> use

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
nice hard push in you may need to use

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.380 
nice hard push in you may need to use
the<00:01:20.670> table<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.540> leverage<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.500> push<00:01:22.680> down<00:01:28.250> and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
the table as leverage to push down and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.170 
the table as leverage to push down and
then<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.540> begin<00:01:30.960> installing<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.829> walls

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
then we can begin installing the walls

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.929 
then we can begin installing the walls
so<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.780> you've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.460> four<00:01:35.460> corners

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so now that you've got your four corners

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.929 
so now that you've got your four corners
assembled<00:01:36.600> you'll<00:01:36.720> notice<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.200> two

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
assembled you'll notice there's two

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.630 
assembled you'll notice there's two
sized<00:01:38.939> walls<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.290> each<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.490> you'll

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
sized walls a two of each and so you'll

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
sized walls a two of each and so you'll
start<00:01:41.880> by<00:01:42.649> aligning<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.450> walls<00:01:45.450> into<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
start by aligning the walls into the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
start by aligning the walls into the
slots<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:48.710> just<00:01:49.710> push<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.700> are

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
slots and just push them in there are

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
slots and just push them in there are
small<00:01:51.420> alignment<00:01:51.960> tabs<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.409> bottoms<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
small alignment tabs at the bottoms to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.280 
small alignment tabs at the bottoms to
keep<00:01:53.130> them<00:01:53.310> aligned<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.869> just<00:01:54.869> press<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
keep them aligned and just press in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:10.140 
keep them aligned and just press in
firmly<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.270> they<00:01:57.270> should<00:01:57.479> slide<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:57.810> in

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.370 

now<00:02:11.150> you're<00:02:11.330> ready<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> assemble<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.080> bottom

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
now you're ready to assemble the bottom

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.760 
now you're ready to assemble the bottom
the<00:02:15.380> bottom<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:15.890> pretty<00:02:16.220> simple<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.850> aligns

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
with the corners and the sides now you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.710 
with the corners and the sides now you
may<00:02:21.050> need<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.350> push<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.459> side<00:02:22.730> tabs<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.570> get

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
may need to push the side tabs in to get

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.860 
may need to push the side tabs in to get
the<00:02:23.870> bottom<00:02:24.500> cleared<00:02:24.860> past<00:02:25.130> them<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.750> help<00:02:26.750> it

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
