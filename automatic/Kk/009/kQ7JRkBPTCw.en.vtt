piles said plans for this year we're
even<00:00:25.560> larger<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.550> weather<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> other

even larger the weather and other

so<00:00:30.029> our<00:00:30.480> scope<00:00:30.750> has<00:00:30.929> expanded<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so our scope has expanded but it's a

so our scope has expanded but it's a
little<00:00:32.550> bit<00:00:32.640> reduced<00:00:33.059> relative<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.260> we

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
little bit reduced relative to what we

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
had planned to do this year that's
mostly<00:00:36.600> due<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.559> difficulty<00:00:38.219> in

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
mostly due to the difficulty in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.520 
mostly due to the difficulty in
obtaining<00:00:38.879> seed<00:00:39.540> early<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> growing

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
obtaining seed early in the growing

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.280 
obtaining seed early in the growing
season<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:41.730> followed<00:00:42.149> by<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.719> very

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
season and then followed by some very

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.400 
season and then followed by some very
contrary<00:00:43.920> weather<00:00:44.390> as<00:00:45.390> far<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.719> planting<00:00:46.020> goes

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
contrary weather as far as planting goes

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.900 
contrary weather as far as planting goes
so<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.039> hard<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.489> seed<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so it was really hard to get seed in the
