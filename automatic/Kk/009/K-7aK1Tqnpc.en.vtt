according to Archimedes principle that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
according to Archimedes principle that
upward<00:01:55.680> buoyant<00:01:55.829> force<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> equal<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
upward buoyant force is equal to the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
upward buoyant force is equal to the
weight<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.509> fluid<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> object

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
weight of the fluid that the object

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.069 
weight of the fluid that the object
displaces<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> buoyant<00:02:00.509> force<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.869> water

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
displaces so the buoyant force in water

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.719 
displaces so the buoyant force in water
is<00:02:01.229> far<00:02:01.560> stronger<00:02:01.950> than<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> buoyant<00:02:02.700> force

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
is far stronger than the buoyant force

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.179 
is far stronger than the buoyant force
in<00:02:03.060> air<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.930> water<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> far<00:02:04.649> more<00:02:04.860> dense

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
in air because water is far more dense

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:05.859 
in air because water is far more dense
than

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
than

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.840

meaning<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:06.500> has<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.649> lot<00:02:07.040> more<00:02:07.070> mass<00:02:07.490> than<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
meaning it has a lot more mass than the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.059 
meaning it has a lot more mass than the
same<00:02:08.030> amount<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.390> volume<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.739> same<00:02:09.920> amount

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
same amount of volume so the same amount

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.250 
same amount of volume so the same amount

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
of volume displaced in the fluid means

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.080 
of volume displaced in the fluid means
it's<00:02:12.440> going<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.739> more<00:02:13.010> mass<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.670> going

it's going to have more mass it's going

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.699 
it's going to have more mass it's going
to<00:02:14.180> weigh<00:02:14.420> more<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.989> therefore<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.470> going<00:02:15.620> to

an object to float the buoyant force

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.580 
an object to float the buoyant force
upward<00:02:20.690> must<00:02:20.870> be<00:02:20.989> stronger<00:02:21.319> than<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
example a rubber duck is less dense than

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.320 
example a rubber duck is less dense than
water<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.950> more<00:02:31.160> dense<00:02:31.370> than<00:02:31.580> air<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.030> it

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
water but more dense than air so it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.720 
water but more dense than air so it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.550 
estimating weigh Lord's dimensions I
subtracted<00:02:50.480> its<00:02:50.630> tail<00:02:50.930> length<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.290> found<00:02:51.470> a

subtracted its tail length and found a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.770 
subtracted its tail length and found a

further illustrate way Lords absurdly
light<00:03:40.370> weight<00:03:40.639> what<00:03:41.450> if<00:03:41.540> we<00:03:41.630> were<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.840> take

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
light weight what if we were to take

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.530 
light weight what if we were to take
Wailord<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.889> moon<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:44.209> moon<00:03:44.329> there's

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
Wailord to the moon on the moon there's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.360 
Wailord to the moon on the moon there's
no<00:03:44.660> atmosphere<00:03:44.900> meaning<00:03:45.590> no<00:03:45.739> fluid<00:03:46.190> for

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
no atmosphere meaning no fluid for

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.009 
no atmosphere meaning no fluid for
Whaler<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.700> be<00:03:46.819> submerged<00:03:47.209> in<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.870> there

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
Whaler to be submerged in so there

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.020 
Whaler to be submerged in so there
wouldn't<00:03:48.350> be<00:03:48.380> any<00:03:48.650> acting<00:03:49.190> buoyant<00:03:49.639> force

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
wouldn't be any acting buoyant force

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.240 
wouldn't be any acting buoyant force
however<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.230> moon<00:03:51.380> has<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.590> different<00:03:51.920> radius

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
however the moon has a different radius

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.250 
however the moon has a different radius
and<00:03:52.489> mass<00:03:52.760> than<00:03:53.060> Earth<00:03:53.209> meaning<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.170> has

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
and mass than Earth meaning that it has

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.780 
and mass than Earth meaning that it has
a<00:03:54.290> different<00:03:54.650> gravitational<00:03:55.310> force<00:03:55.579> due<00:03:55.760> to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
a different gravitational force due to

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.479 
a different gravitational force due to

calculating<00:03:58.489> with<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.670> alternate<00:03:59.060> values<00:03:59.450> we

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
calculating with the alternate values we

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.390 
calculating with the alternate values we
find<00:03:59.810> that<00:04:00.109> the<00:04:00.170> moon's<00:04:00.410> gravitational<00:04:01.160> force

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
find that the moon's gravitational force

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.250 
find that the moon's gravitational force
is<00:04:01.549> only<00:04:01.670> about<00:04:01.910> one-sixth<00:04:02.690> as<00:04:02.810> strong<00:04:03.109> as

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
is only about one-sixth as strong as

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.110 
is only about one-sixth as strong as
Earth's<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:04.400> means<00:04:04.579> if<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.790> were<00:04:04.850> on<00:04:05.000> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
Earth's that means if you were on the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.150 
Earth's that means if you were on the
moon<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.630> would<00:04:05.750> weigh<00:04:05.900> 1/6<00:04:06.560> as<00:04:06.739> much<00:04:06.889> as<00:04:07.040> you

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
moon you would weigh 1/6 as much as you

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.320 
moon you would weigh 1/6 as much as you
do<00:04:07.340> right<00:04:07.579> now

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
do right now

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.720 
do right now
so<00:04:08.990> how<00:04:09.560> much<00:04:09.740> would<00:04:09.920> Wailord<00:04:10.340> weigh<00:04:10.490> on<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
so how much would Wailord weigh on the

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.080 
so how much would Wailord weigh on the
moon<00:04:11.590> 146<00:04:12.590> point<00:04:12.860> two<00:04:13.070> or<00:04:13.100> three<00:04:13.400> pounds<00:04:13.610> or

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
sixty six point three kilograms this

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.100 
sixty six point three kilograms this
means<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.360> on<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.600> moon

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
means that on the moon

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.680 
means that on the moon
I<00:04:18.140> could<00:04:18.650> benchpress<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.610> largest<00:04:20.180> pokemon

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
think another lesson we've learned is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.710 
think another lesson we've learned is
that<00:04:33.830> pokedex<00:04:34.460> data<00:04:34.730> can<00:04:34.970> be<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.120> bit<00:04:36.130> off<00:04:37.720> but

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
that pokedex data can be a bit off but

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.060 
that pokedex data can be a bit off but
that<00:04:38.960> makes<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.200> fun<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.380> analyze<00:04:39.860> that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
doesn't it what'd you think of my
