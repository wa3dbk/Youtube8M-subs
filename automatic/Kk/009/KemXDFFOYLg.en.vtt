00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.190
 that we do not have beauty in hand, let's go 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.480
 to have the crouch button ok when 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 let's put on beauty will leave us 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.840
 this good menu that we do in this menu 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.580
 well easy we grab this come 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.800
 the pure thread of the crossbow we do 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.260
 down with your finger and there we leave it 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.390
 here we put a projectile on top 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.890
 and well guys, now, just 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 we leave pressed on the screen 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 as we did with the bow and pum 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.330
 this what the Hurdler have 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.760
 three different styles as are the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.220
 normal 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.650
 the diamond that goes down a bit more 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.650
 and the most pig that is the explosive 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.760
 the explosive if it is very comfortable for me 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.350
 dog sorry I bit the vato good the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.530
 explosive if it's the most pig like they can 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.530
 see let's kill this little bird 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.630
 They see that pork is and it's cool because 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.509
 gives cooked food 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 gives you the cooked food that is very 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.829
 very cool come 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.520
 there is the poyete we grabbed for 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.520
 eat right now 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.040
 and good this project is very strong 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.420
 It is worth mentioning because to see we are going to 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.850
 try it against monkeys or for you 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.920
 They can see 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.979
 and see what they do or practically 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.210
 can kill anything from a shot 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.409
 practically to anyone I'm not 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.900
 making sure guys have never tried it 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.729
 against an orca or if this is going to be super 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.679
 goat against orcas yes yes but no 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.630
 I never tested with orcas and I know 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.610
 it works in the water 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.500
 if we throw it into the water because there was 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.420
 water not true snow not good then 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.520
 we're going to try it but I think if 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 we throw it in water yes it works it does not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.480
 will be super against the contras 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 the orcas good now we go to the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.280
 second part we already saw how to load and already 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 we saw the three types of projectiles 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.250
 now let's move on to the next part 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.670
 which is to craft eo let's leave 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.130
 this around here and this around here and this 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.500
 I'm going to eat it 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.600
 we go to the chest and good as crafter 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.550
 the crossbow to capture the valise 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.670
 we need this this 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.820
 and these guys ok how do we get the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 rope with this the rope is created 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.180
 A) Yes 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.600
 about three and here we have the agreement that 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.380
 it is this scourge we are now like kraft and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.110
 We love these sticks because these projects 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.030
 what we do with this 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.709
 and come on let's remove the coal 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.800
 these countries will characterize here in the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.130
 oven they put two of these 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.730
 2 iron and good we put here 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.930
 fuel and these are not going to come out 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.620
 bars 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.170
 come now see them we have them good 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.629
 Now, as we were growing this, 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.370
 we know it's wood like grafite masters what 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.000
 more important the crossbow then we put 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.000
 one from here 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.310
 I was not here this here and I'm 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.310
 here, guys 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.870
 so that's how he stayed from the crossbow and well 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.940
 here we have it as you can see we have 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.190
 we took a crossbow 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.490
 and now as crack we have the arrows 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:02.370
 Now that's easy, we're going to need 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.370
 feathers this and this 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.030
 this is gunpowder 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.880
 simple from ivÃ¡n to gunpowder 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.290
 we can leave it here that now 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.109
 it's getting in the way 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.150
 and this we grabbed as we classified the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.320
 gunpowder first of all because the gunpowder 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.460
 It is created with a coal 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.040
 let's grab three with sulfur and with 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.770
 this material are called psalterium 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.500
 what are we the this mineral that 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.040
 they give us this in the sand by digging 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.910
 downwards ok 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.220
 these 3 minerals form the gunpowder or the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.180
 gong pouler and good as creation over 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.160
 the arrows is easy 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.240
 the arrows of the crossbow so that's how 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.639
 be character 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.190
 we have enough arrows we have 24 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.980
 right now 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.800
 and now here as graffite moles of 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.169
 diamond thus in this way 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.110
 and as we grow the gum powder then 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.090
 in this way the explosives 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.830
 and good guys I think with this 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.660
 we finished today's tutorial 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.740
 that it was simply how to use the 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.740
 crossbow miren 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.220
 if you want more tutorials then 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.380
 they just have to leave me here 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.600
 in the comments and sorry they have not 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.580
 I send the greetings I am going to send them 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.710
 Well, I'll be here soon 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.140
 sending these particles out 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.730
 now we can burn the guys we 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.590
 they can burn and they can cause us a mess 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.020
 quite pretty fat so have 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.420
 very careful so if you liked the 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.420
 Video light favorites and comment 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.880
 and well, I'm not the mister meta joe until 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.880

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.919
 and me
