00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.439
 Hello guys and welcome back to the channel 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.789
 to the manager in this I wanted to show 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.980
 a quick recipe that also has 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.169
 described on the facebook group on how 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.939
 prepare simple and written desserts 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.369
 use to remove the desire from time to time 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.779
 of sweet so these are sweets that you 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.140
 they really prepare in just a few minutes 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.020
 it is based on almond butter fruit 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.270
 and of dark chocolate with a great one 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.969
 profile also of marcos therefore always in 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.690
 features the flexible diet line 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.360
 but cruz 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.000
 I also feel a bodybuilder exaggerate 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.980
 can afford sweets every once in a while 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.269
 take off some desire sect a lot 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.190
 simple as I said before with 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.629
 very few ingredients two bananas a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.149
 tablespoon of almond butter ever 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.749
 ready and about 150 grams of chocolate 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.940
 melting 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.710
 in this case lactose-free chocolate 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.149
 normal circulation is very well chosen 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.430
 this simply for a better one 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.830
 marcus's profile then i go to cut the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.290
 banana with washers and spread with a 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.900
 knife a bit of pure almond of 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.479
 never produced and the other created 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.479
 this sort of bon bon of pralines of 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.220
 fruit then after several attempts I have 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.630
 verified that it is important to add 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.800
 at this stage also toothpicks 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.040
 to then better dip the banana in the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.660
 then important melted chocolate is 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.490
 got to this point put in 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.820
 freezer for 30 minutes then better 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.280
 just work with these pralines here 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.920
 here in the middle of the chicken then this phase 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.920
 let's go and melt the chocolate a 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.860
 very simple bain-marie here too 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 matter of minutes and then you see with it 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.190
 same valente I can at least make the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.130
 base of these pralines and then with a 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.790
 spoon I am going to cover the part 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.350
 over another 30 minutes in the freezer and then 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.750
 this is the final result 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 obviously not all Colari 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.980
 because this is a homemade product 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.130
 which I assure you are particularly 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.890
 the interior is also good having precisely 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.510
 banana still a little fresh with the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.360
 almond bully a combination of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.489
 tastes really good and in terms of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.590
 macros always in line with the features 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.989
 macro if the flexible approach to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.280
 diet that I have been preaching for some time too 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.770
 this channel 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.710
 the total using these ingredients 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.950
 were 115 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.880
 g of carbohydrates 12.3 grams of protein 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.120
 and 51.3 grams of fat therefore per 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.290
 each praline 7.6 grams of 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 carbohydrates 0.8 grams of protein and 3.4 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.770
 grams of fat 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.730
 obviously one can eat them too 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.320
 all one can eat 12 of them in di 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.000
 fog mind with the flexible approach 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.180
 to the diet and next steps I have 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.190
 precedents provided by your diet 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.470
 I think it's still a recipe 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.800
 interesting to take off with the desire 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.270
 of sweet or chocolate that occasionally 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.410
 especially you women 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.800
 you always say to be alarmed immediately 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.980
 for having just ruined the direct ho 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.870
 eaten in excess well that's it 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.950
 I greet you and refer you again to i 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.700
 next videos 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.700
 see you soon bye
