00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
another company I was thinking of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.660 
another company I was thinking of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.580 
it's i'm not actually cooking of flavor
but<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.329> 2005<00:00:51.329> i<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:52.230> working<00:00:52.469> for

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
but back in the 2005 i was working for

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.810 
but back in the 2005 i was working for
another<00:00:52.680> company<00:00:52.860> i<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.460> thinking<00:00:53.789> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
another company i was thinking of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
another company i was thinking of
something<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.210> doing<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> philippines<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
something was doing the philippines and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.099 
something was doing the philippines and
so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> thought<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.520> lumber<00:00:56.879> nog<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so I thought of lumber nog and the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
so I thought of lumber nog and the
original<00:00:58.230> idea<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.160> take<00:00:59.340> limbo<00:00:59.789> nog<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
original idea was to take limbo nog and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.950 
original idea was to take limbo nog and
put<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:02.280> bottle<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> branded<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
put it into a bottle and branded and I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640 
put it into a bottle and branded and I
exported<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.390> imported<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> US<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
exported and imported here to the US and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310 
exported and imported here to the US and
then<00:01:07.799> distributed<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> problem<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
then distributed but the problem was it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320 
then distributed but the problem was it
when<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.040> did<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> sampling<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> taste

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
when we did the sampling and the taste

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
when we did the sampling and the taste
test<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.049> didn't<00:01:13.380> didn't<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.340> off

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
test it just didn't didn't take off

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.190 
test it just didn't didn't take off
didn't<00:01:14.820> take<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.150> I'd<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.110> many

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
didn't take off I'd see there's so many

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.480 
didn't take off I'd see there's so many
flavors<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.860> lumber<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.189> there's<00:01:17.369> like

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
flavors the lumber know there's like

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.760 
flavors the lumber know there's like
bubblegum<00:01:17.909> flavor<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> other<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.680> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
bubblegum flavor or the other well we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.969 
bubblegum flavor or the other well we
focused<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.310> puter<00:01:21.180> which<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
focused on puter which is just the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.850 
focused on puter which is just the
standard<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.790> distilled<00:01:24.409> coconut<00:01:25.409> okay

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
standard you know distilled coconut okay

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060 
standard you know distilled coconut okay
and<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:28.140> us<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.799> wanted

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and I think for us to do that we wanted

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.219 
and I think for us to do that we wanted
to<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.930> wanted<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to do that just because we wanted to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
to do that just because we wanted to
establish<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.710> base<00:01:32.070> product<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
establish a base product for that I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.109 
establish a base product for that I
think<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> line<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.070> we'll<00:01:35.400> we'll

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
think down the line I think we'll we'll

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.120 
think down the line I think we'll we'll
move<00:01:36.299> forward<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> try<00:01:37.380> different<00:01:37.439> flavors

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
move forward and try different flavors

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
move forward and try different flavors
and<00:01:38.280> maybe<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> exotic<00:01:39.329> different

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and maybe some of the exotic different

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
and maybe some of the exotic different
fruits<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> paint<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> lumber<00:01:41.610> dog

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
fruits of the paint so the lumber dog

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.139 
fruits of the paint so the lumber dog
didn't<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.939> did

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
didn't take off and then so what we did

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.330 
didn't take off and then so what we did
was<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.509> started<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.070> four-year<00:01:47.070> roller

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
was that started a four-year roller

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.920 
was that started a four-year roller
coaster<00:01:47.909> ride<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:49.280> development<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
coaster ride of development and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.149 
coaster ride of development and
basically<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.079> had<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> tweak<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.860> entire

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
basically we had to tweak the entire

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.109 
basically we had to tweak the entire
production<00:01:53.399> process<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> numba<00:01:55.170> ugh

days you have to have something that's
unique<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:34.970> not<00:02:35.060> overly<00:02:35.420> unique<00:02:35.810> you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
unique right but not overly unique you

unique right but not overly unique you
nose<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:39.170> fact<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.680> token

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
nose and I'm so the fact that it's token

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.070 
nose and I'm so the fact that it's token
it's<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.610> still<00:02:40.910> familiar<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.660> people<00:02:41.690> I

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
think that's what's going to really

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.100 
think that's what's going to really

vodka which and you've got a plenty of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.990 
vodka which and you've got a plenty of
different<00:03:23.510> vodkas<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:24.140> do<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.100> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
different vodkas that do that and so the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.550 
different vodkas that do that and so the
fact<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.510> made<00:03:26.750> from<00:03:26.930> coconut<00:03:27.320> is

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
fact that it's made from coconut is

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.289 
fact that it's made from coconut is
different<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.190> its<00:03:28.370> unique<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.120> also

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
different and its unique but it's also

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.520 
different and its unique but it's also
familiar<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.989> think<00:03:30.200> that's<00:03:30.350> what's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
familiar and I think that's what's

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.930 
familiar and I think that's what's
really<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.920> help<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.160> catch<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.730> it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
really going to help it catch is it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.110 
really going to help it catch is it
healthy<00:03:32.950> or<00:03:33.950> at<00:03:34.070> least<00:03:34.220> amount<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.519> calories
