00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
which is great you're leveling it out in

like I should okay and I do feel
comfortable<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.469> afraid<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> falling

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
comfortable I'm not afraid of falling

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
comfortable I'm not afraid of falling
that's<00:01:03.090> good<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.809> glad<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.680> have

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that's good I'm glad that you don't have

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
that's good I'm glad that you don't have
that<00:01:05.100> fear<00:01:05.489> they're<00:01:05.760> stopping<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> from

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that fear they're stopping you from

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.770 
that fear they're stopping you from
progressing<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> main<00:01:09.030> thing<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
progressing the main thing that this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
progressing the main thing that this
basically<00:01:10.409> boils<00:01:10.710> down<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:12.060> not

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
basically boils down to is just not

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.440 
basically boils down to is just not
really<00:01:13.200> fully<00:01:13.560> having<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> previous<00:01:14.580> step<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
really fully having the previous step in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
really fully having the previous step in
so<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.560> previous<00:01:17.009> step<00:01:17.220> before<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:18.180> into

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so the previous step before you get into

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
so the previous step before you get into
learning<00:01:18.780> how<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.200> Ollie's<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
learning how to do Ollie's is just

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.660 
learning how to do Ollie's is just
riding<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:21.030> board<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.659> turning

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
riding your board around turning

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
riding your board around turning
stopping<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.850> board<00:01:24.320> dodging<00:01:25.320> cracks<00:01:25.650> rocks

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
stopping your board dodging cracks rocks

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.960 
stopping your board dodging cracks rocks
crevasses<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.180> anything<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.110> um<00:01:28.970> by

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
crevasses and anything like that um by

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
crevasses and anything like that um by
looking<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.689> video<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:32.009> would

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
looking at your video I think it would

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
looking at your video I think it would
be<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.579> good<00:01:32.850> idea<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> loosen

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
be a really good idea for you to loosen

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560 
be a really good idea for you to loosen
up<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.170> truck's<00:01:35.000> loosen<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.210> trucks<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
up your truck's loosen up your trucks a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
up your truck's loosen up your trucks a
little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
little bit so you have a little bit of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.179 
little bit so you have a little bit of
leeway<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.820> both<00:01:39.299> ends<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.680> being<00:01:40.920> able<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
leeway on both ends just being able to

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.060 
leeway on both ends just being able to
turn<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:41.880> side<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> side<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> different<00:01:43.890> kind

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
turn from side to side so different kind

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
turn from side to side so different kind
of<00:01:44.100> turns<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.420> by<00:01:45.840> just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of turns that you can do one is by just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.219 
of turns that you can do one is by just
leaning<00:01:46.439> where<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.189> trucks<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:48.240> bend

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
leaning where your trucks actually bend

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
leaning where your trucks actually bend
and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:49.740> turn<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> other<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.149> is

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and then turn and then the other one is

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.690 
and then turn and then the other one is
where<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> kick<00:01:52.799> turn<00:01:53.040> where<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> lift

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
where you do a kick turn where you lift

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.639 
where you do a kick turn where you lift
up<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> nose<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> board<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.140> turn

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
up the nose of the board and then turn

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
up the nose of the board and then turn
it<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.460> should<00:01:56.670> learn<00:01:56.909> all<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.270> those

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it so you should learn all of those

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
it so you should learn all of those
steps<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.619> these<00:01:58.740> are<00:01:58.799> gun<00:01:59.219> over<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
steps and all of these are gun over and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.480 
steps and all of these are gun over and
skateboarding<00:02:00.149> made<00:02:00.329> simple<00:02:00.750> volume<00:02:01.079> one

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
skateboarding made simple volume one

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.190 
skateboarding made simple volume one
really<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.479> well<00:02:03.810> before

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really really really really well before

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.600 
really really really really well before
you<00:02:04.680> begin<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.820> learning<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.450> ollie<00:02:06.659> moving

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
you begin to learning your ollie moving

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.630 
you begin to learning your ollie moving
so<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.200> basic<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:11.099> because

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so that's really the basic there because

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670 
so that's really the basic there because
as<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:12.840> here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
as you can see here

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
as you can see here
I<00:02:13.710> got<00:02:14.160> my<00:02:14.310> Ollie's<00:02:14.700> down<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.020> pop

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I got my Ollie's down so I can just pop

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.710 
I got my Ollie's down so I can just pop
them<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.500> while<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.130> riding<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.480> didn't

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
them up while I'm riding but if I didn't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540 
them up while I'm riding but if I didn't
have<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.900> previous<00:02:19.530> step<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.950> writing<00:02:20.370> down

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
have that previous step of writing down

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.060 
have that previous step of writing down
I<00:02:20.880> would<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> little<00:02:21.870> bit<00:02:22.020> shaky<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.890> my

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
I would be a little bit shaky just on my

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.330 
I would be a little bit shaky just on my
balance<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.360> when<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.830> step<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
balance so when I do this step of the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.600 
balance so when I do this step of the
ollie<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.390> land<00:02:27.690> my<00:02:28.380> weight<00:02:29.100> might<00:02:29.430> be

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
ollie as I land my weight might be

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.270 
ollie as I land my weight might be
they're<00:02:29.880> too<00:02:30.090> far<00:02:30.330> back<00:02:30.660> or<00:02:31.050> too<00:02:31.110> far<00:02:31.560> forward

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
they're too far back or too far forward

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.040 
they're too far back or too far forward
and<00:02:32.820> then<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> board's<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.630> fly<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:34.020> in

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and then the board's going to fly out in

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.350 
and then the board's going to fly out in
front<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.530> me<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.550> you're<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:35.970> really

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
front of me but if you're really really

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
front of me but if you're really really
comfortable<00:02:36.840> riding<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.620> board<00:02:37.830> which<00:02:38.340> is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
comfortable riding your board which is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.610 
comfortable riding your board which is
just<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> previous<00:02:39.450> step<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.320> you're<00:02:40.500> going

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
just the previous step then you're going

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.350 
just the previous step then you're going
to<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.920> where<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:41.460> your<00:02:41.640> balance<00:02:42.030> you're

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
to know where to put your balance you're

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.180 
to know where to put your balance you're
going<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> have<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:43.050> balance<00:02:43.440> down<00:02:43.680> as<00:02:44.010> it's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
going to have your balance down as it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.760 
going to have your balance down as it's
very<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:45.000> practiced<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:46.590> you're

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
very well practiced and then you're

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.440 
very well practiced and then you're
going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.070> be<00:02:47.310> able<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.790> pop<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.270> wholly

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
going to be able to just pop it wholly

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.590 
going to be able to just pop it wholly
up<00:02:48.690> pop<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.500> over<00:02:49.760> objects<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.060> land<00:02:51.360> and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
up pop it over objects and then land and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.900 
up pop it over objects and then land and
roll<00:02:51.720> away<00:02:52.280> when<00:02:53.280> learning<00:02:53.520> how<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.790> ollie

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
roll away when learning how to ollie

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.660 
roll away when learning how to ollie
while<00:02:54.420> moving<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.900> suggest<00:02:55.410> finding<00:02:56.010> very

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
while moving I suggest finding very

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.620 
while moving I suggest finding very
small<00:02:57.180> little<00:02:57.660> objects<00:02:58.260> just<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.800> pop<00:02:59.070> over

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
small little objects just to pop over

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
small little objects just to pop over
start<00:03:00.630> out<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:00.990> just<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> line<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:02.550> go

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
start out with just the line and then go

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.680 
start out with just the line and then go
to<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.940> crack<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:05.270> hose<00:03:06.270> or<00:03:06.660> a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
to a crack and then go to a hose or a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.650 
to a crack and then go to a hose or a
stick<00:03:07.080> or<00:03:07.320> some<00:03:07.530> very<00:03:07.740> small<00:03:08.100> objects<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
stick or some very small objects it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.150 
stick or some very small objects it
would<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.870> good<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.470> practice<00:03:10.950> where

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
would be good for you to practice where

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.400 
would be good for you to practice where
you<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.459> some<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:11.970> space<00:03:12.390> as<00:03:12.690> well<00:03:12.900> because

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
you have some more space as well because

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.140 
you have some more space as well because
it<00:03:13.680> looks<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.160> kind<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.459> get<00:03:14.640> pushing

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
it looks like you kind of get pushing

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.000 
it looks like you kind of get pushing
and<00:03:15.630> then<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.900> pop<00:03:16.140> an<00:03:16.320> ollie<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:16.830> your

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and then you pop an ollie and then your

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.460 
and then you pop an ollie and then your
speed<00:03:17.370> runs<00:03:17.670> out<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> other<00:03:18.930> thing<00:03:19.200> is

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
speed runs out and the other thing is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.530 
speed runs out and the other thing is
you<00:03:19.620> might<00:03:19.830> want<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.070> upgrade<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.700> wheels<00:03:21.120> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
you might want to upgrade the wheels and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.060 
you might want to upgrade the wheels and
your<00:03:21.690> bearings<00:03:22.110> because<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.440> looks<00:03:22.620> like<00:03:22.830> they

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
your bearings because it looks like they

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.720 
your bearings because it looks like they
don't<00:03:23.280> roll<00:03:23.610> as<00:03:23.910> well<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.390> they<00:03:24.750> may<00:03:24.989> be<00:03:25.019> good

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
don't roll as well as they may be good

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.070 
don't roll as well as they may be good
cool<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.120> any<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.480> guys<00:03:27.600> learning<00:03:27.900> the
