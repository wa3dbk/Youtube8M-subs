00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.789 
gonna waste arrows like this but I'm
hoping<00:03:06.360> later<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.110> will<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.320> plug<00:03:07.620> in

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
hoping later on there will be a plug in

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.930 
hoping later on there will be a plug in
my<00:03:08.489> my<00:03:08.880> vision<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.630> plug-in<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:10.940> where

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
my my vision of a plug-in would be where

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
my my vision of a plug-in would be where
you<00:03:11.970> put<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> sign<00:03:12.390> beside<00:03:12.600> under<00:03:12.959> whatever<00:03:13.079> and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
you put a sign beside under whatever and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
you put a sign beside under whatever and
it<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.640> an<00:03:14.820> auto<00:03:15.060> turret<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
it would be like an auto turret that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.270 
it would be like an auto turret that
would<00:03:15.930> hit<00:03:16.140> only<00:03:16.350> NPCs<00:03:17.070> only<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:19.100> what<00:03:20.100> would

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
would hit only NPCs only and what would

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.370 
would hit only NPCs only and what would
happen<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.239> turn<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.630> friendly<00:03:22.109> or

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
happen is you can turn it on friendly or

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.039 
happen is you can turn it on friendly or
enemy<00:03:22.799> like<00:03:23.459> aggressive<00:03:24.209> like<00:03:24.390> creepers<00:03:24.780> or

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
enemy like aggressive like creepers or

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.819 
enemy like aggressive like creepers or
you<00:03:25.799> know<00:03:25.890> farm<00:03:26.430> animals<00:03:26.549> as<00:03:26.940> well<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.829> what

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
you know farm animals as well and what

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.380 
you know farm animals as well and what
you<00:03:28.950> would<00:03:29.070> do<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.310> you'd<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.670> big<00:03:29.910> gate<00:03:30.150> in

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
you would do is you'd have a big gate in

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.910 
you would do is you'd have a big gate in
front<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.810> city<00:03:31.049> right<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.799> know

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
front of your city right to you know

front of your city right to you know
enter<00:03:32.310> whatever<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.060> these<00:03:33.600> turrets<00:03:34.170> will

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
enter whatever and these turrets will

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.509 
enter whatever and these turrets will
fire<00:03:34.799> on<00:03:35.450> those<00:03:36.450> only<00:03:36.959> like<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:38.400> know<00:03:38.489> a

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
fire on those only like the you know a

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.759 
fire on those only like the you know a
little<00:03:38.700> direct<00:03:39.000> them<00:03:39.209> they'll<00:03:39.420> be<00:03:39.510> like

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
little direct them they'll be like

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.990 
little direct them they'll be like
seeking<00:03:40.769> arrows<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.310> something<00:03:41.670> fun<00:03:41.850> like

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
seeking arrows or something fun like

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.690 
seeking arrows or something fun like
that<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:43.410> still<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.950> fill<00:03:44.130> them<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.430> but

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
that you still have to fill them up but

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.340 
that you still have to fill them up but
they<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.269> would<00:03:45.420> be<00:03:45.540> wasting<00:03:45.690> arrows<00:03:46.170> like

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
they you would be wasting arrows like

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.170 
they you would be wasting arrows like
crazy<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.950> would<00:03:47.070> only<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:47.640> someone<00:03:47.970> like

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
crazy it would only be if someone like

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.120 
crazy it would only be if someone like
somehow<00:03:48.420> dragged<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.049> bunch<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.410> mobs<00:03:49.739> into

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
somehow dragged a bunch of mobs into

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.890 
somehow dragged a bunch of mobs into
your<00:03:50.250> city<00:03:50.519> like<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.820> second<00:03:51.359> protection

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
your city like a second protection

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.500 
your city like a second protection
system<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:53.579> would<00:03:53.700> just<00:03:53.730> basically<00:03:53.970> home

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
system and it would just basically home

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.490 
system and it would just basically home
on<00:03:54.720> them

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
on them

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.850 
on them
and<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:56.630> think<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.750> would<00:03:57.930> be<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.280> whoa<00:04:00.410> weird<00:04:01.410> I

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
and I think that would be a whoa weird I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.630 
and I think that would be a whoa weird I
think<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.340> would<00:04:02.490> be<00:04:02.610> an<00:04:02.760> awesome<00:04:03.000> idea<00:04:04.640> but

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
think that would be an awesome idea but

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.790 
think that would be an awesome idea but
also<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.630> protecting<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.290> stuff<00:04:07.500> i<00:04:07.680> mean

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
also for protecting your stuff i mean

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.410 
also for protecting your stuff i mean
just<00:04:08.010> using<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.490> system<00:04:08.670> itself<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.360> can

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
just using the system itself you can

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.100 
just using the system itself you can
have<00:04:09.740> like<00:04:10.740> a<00:04:10.830> corridor<00:04:11.390> we're<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:12.660> going<00:04:12.900> in

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
have like a corridor we're like going in

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.199 
have like a corridor we're like going in
through<00:04:13.350> here<00:04:13.680> maybe<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.640> have<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.090> know

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
through here maybe you have to you know

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.840 
through here maybe you have to you know
how<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.420> unlock<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.350> door<00:04:16.560> or<00:04:16.709> whatever<00:04:17.010> well

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
how you unlock the door or whatever well

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.060 
how you unlock the door or whatever well
maybe<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.079> unlock<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.500> door<00:04:19.709> wrong<00:04:19.920> it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
maybe if you unlock the door wrong it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.560 
maybe if you unlock the door wrong it
still<00:04:20.310> opens<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.700> door<00:04:20.910> or<00:04:21.030> something<00:04:21.239> like

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
still opens the door or something like

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.110 
still opens the door or something like
that<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:22.530> there's<00:04:23.010> like<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> battery<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
that but there's like a battery of the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.690 
that but there's like a battery of the
the<00:04:25.110> turrets<00:04:25.470> there<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.920> they<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.460> own

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
the turrets there and they just like own

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:36.350 
the turrets there and they just like own
the<00:04:26.910> crap<00:04:27.120> idea<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:35.610> funny<00:04:35.880> because<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.180> think

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
the crap idea it's funny because I think

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.940 
the crap idea it's funny because I think
the<00:04:36.510> chickens<00:04:36.750> are<00:04:36.990> still<00:04:37.230> getting<00:04:37.470> owned<00:04:37.740> by

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
the chickens are still getting owned by

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:45.050 
the chickens are still getting owned by
their<00:04:38.160> own<00:04:38.370> eggs<00:04:38.640> Oh<00:04:42.830> almost<00:04:43.830> done<00:04:44.060> anyways

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
their own eggs Oh almost done anyways

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.580 
their own eggs Oh almost done anyways
yeah<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.600> thought<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:46.140> kind<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.380> cool<00:04:46.440> if

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
yeah I thought that was kind of cool if

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.790 
yeah I thought that was kind of cool if
I<00:04:46.740> don't<00:04:46.919> share<00:04:47.660> hopefully<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:48.840> leg<00:04:49.200> gets

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
I don't share hopefully this leg gets

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.500 
I don't share hopefully this leg gets
fixed<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.550> if<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:50.790> guys<00:04:50.880> want<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.210> play<00:04:51.300> the

fixed and if you guys want to play the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.780 
fixed and if you guys want to play the
server<00:04:51.780> well<00:04:52.470> oh<00:04:52.919> yeah<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.310> can't<00:04:53.580> from<00:04:53.760> here

server well oh yeah you can't from here

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.409 
server well oh yeah you can't from here
it'll<00:04:54.150> be<00:04:54.270> in<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.450> description<00:04:54.960> on<00:04:55.200> how<00:04:55.230> to

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
it'll be in the description on how to

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.210 
it'll be in the description on how to
I'll<00:04:57.419> see<00:04:57.660> when<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.840> log<00:04:58.140> in<00:04:58.350> again<00:04:58.380> it's<00:04:58.919> fast

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
I'll see when I log in again it's fast

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.450 
I'll see when I log in again it's fast
so<00:04:59.640> it's<00:05:00.380> just<00:05:01.380> D<00:05:01.590> sinks<00:05:02.040> it's<00:05:02.190> just<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
so it's just D sinks it's just the
