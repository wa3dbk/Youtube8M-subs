say<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.720> first<00:03:38.049> day<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:38.590> after<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:39.370> a

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
say this is first day here after in a

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.120 
say this is first day here after in a
washing<00:03:39.700> last<00:03:40.269> night<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:41.019> think<00:03:41.920> that's<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
washing last night so I think that's a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.590 
washing last night so I think that's a
huge<00:03:42.340> success<00:03:42.549> because<00:03:42.940> most<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.390> time<00:03:43.570> I

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
huge success because most of the time I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.060 
huge success because most of the time I
don't<00:03:43.870> like<00:03:44.049> my<00:03:44.200> hair<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.410> much<00:03:45.690> when<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:47.070> wash

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
don't like my hair that much when I wash

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.680 
don't like my hair that much when I wash
it<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.519> then<00:03:48.640> style<00:03:48.910> at<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.180> next<00:03:49.450> for<00:03:49.600> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
it and then style at the next for the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.060 
it and then style at the next for the
next<00:03:49.900> day<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> next<00:03:50.260> day<00:03:50.440> normally<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:50.950> like

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
next day the next day normally it's like

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.199 
next day the next day normally it's like
it's<00:03:51.730> shrunken<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:52.930> compacted<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.209> so

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
it's shrunken and it's compacted and so

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.050
