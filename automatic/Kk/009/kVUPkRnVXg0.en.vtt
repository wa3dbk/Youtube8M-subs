a<00:00:14.070> square<00:00:14.429> head<00:00:14.759> lamp<00:00:15.059> sort<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.480> retro<00:00:15.990> looking

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
a square head lamp sort of retro looking

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.439 
a square head lamp sort of retro looking
sort<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:17.449> appearance<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:20.090> they're<00:00:21.090> not

worth<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> lot<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.050> money<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> guess<00:00:22.769> it's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
worth a lot of money now I guess it's

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.560 
worth a lot of money now I guess it's
pretty<00:00:23.039> worth<00:00:23.279> thousand<00:00:24.000> five<00:00:24.359> hundred

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
pretty worth thousand five hundred

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.769 
pretty worth thousand five hundred
pounds<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.199> something<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
pounds or something like that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.299 
pounds or something like that
and<00:00:29.390> they<00:00:30.390> seem<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:31.019> other<00:00:31.859> thing<00:00:32.130> every

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and they seem to me other thing every

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.970 
and they seem to me other thing every
would<00:00:32.460> agree<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.090> sort<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> bike<00:00:33.600> that

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
would agree there's a sort of bike that

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.319 
would agree there's a sort of bike that
perhaps<00:00:34.980> somebody's<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
perhaps somebody's not really that in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.940 
perhaps somebody's not really that in
the<00:00:36.450> biking<00:00:36.870> what's<00:00:37.020> kind<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.530> because

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the biking what's kind of right because

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.729 
the biking what's kind of right because
the<00:00:38.100> riding<00:00:38.430> position<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:39.000> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> very

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
the riding position is kind of very

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.080 
the riding position is kind of very
universal<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.670> isn't<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.059> touring<00:00:42.750> sports

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
universal it isn't really touring sports

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.400 
universal it isn't really touring sports
anything<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> good

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
anything really but it is just a good

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.260 
anything really but it is just a good
generous<00:00:46.920> all-around<00:00:47.690> general-purpose<00:00:48.690> bike

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
generous all-around general-purpose bike

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.740 
generous all-around general-purpose bike
and<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:53.010> model<00:00:53.370> goes<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.850> back<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> about

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and this model goes right back to about

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.139 
and this model goes right back to about
1990<00:00:55.550> no<00:00:57.680> 1977<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.800> something<00:00:59.219> 76<00:00:59.820> something

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
1990 no 1977 or something 76 something

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
1990 no 1977 or something 76 something
like<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> an

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
like that and it's kind of an

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.759 
like that and it's kind of an
involvement<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.500> lots

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
involvement from there so there's lots

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.500 
involvement from there so there's lots
of<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:05.010> around<00:01:05.369> parts<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:06.030> easy<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> get

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
of these around parts are easy to get

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
of these around parts are easy to get
used<00:01:06.750> parts<00:01:09.049> it's<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> fairly<00:01:10.590> low<00:01:10.710> seat

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
used parts it's got a fairly low seat

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
used parts it's got a fairly low seat
height<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> guess<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.510> not

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
height on it so I guess if you're not

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.090 
height on it so I guess if you're not
too<00:01:12.810> big<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> chap<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> nice<00:01:13.890> thing

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
too big a chap it's kind of a nice thing

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.060 
too big a chap it's kind of a nice thing
it<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.790> feet<00:01:14.970> down<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.710> need<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:16.920> get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it just you feet down I need you all get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.170 
it just you feet down I need you all get
kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> modified<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.000> sort<00:01:18.150> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
kind of modified with these sort of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
kind of modified with these sort of
wider<00:01:18.420> handlebars<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
wider handlebars on them which I kind of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.530 
wider handlebars on them which I kind of
like<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.880> solid<00:01:21.270> leaning

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
like that really you get solid leaning

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.960 
like that really you get solid leaning
forward<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.930> wide<00:01:22.110> bars<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.650> sort<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.970> flat

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
forward with wide bars this sort of flat

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
forward with wide bars this sort of flat
track<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> can't<00:01:24.780> sort<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.110> feel<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
track I can't sort of feel to it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
track I can't sort of feel to it
which<00:01:25.979> gives<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> nice<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
which gives you a nice little bit of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
which gives you a nice little bit of
control<00:01:30.079> what<00:01:31.079> else<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> tell<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> about

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
control what else can I tell you about

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.960 
control what else can I tell you about
this<00:01:31.920> thing<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> liquid<00:01:32.490> cooled<00:01:34.759> I've<00:01:35.759> never

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this thing is liquid cooled I've never

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.190 
this thing is liquid cooled I've never
really<00:01:36.299> thought<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> given<00:01:36.869> modern<00:01:37.079> he's<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really thought of given modern he's a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.340 
really thought of given modern he's a
big<00:01:37.439> handle<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.070> ridden<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.350> Jeep

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
big handle but I've ridden the Jeep

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.870 
big handle but I've ridden the Jeep
easier<00:01:40.710> level<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.460> has<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.640> same

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
easier level on it which has the same

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
easier level on it which has the same
engine<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.570> potentially<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.439> fast

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
engine that is potentially a very fast

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
engine that is potentially a very fast
bike<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> has<00:01:45.210> probably

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
bike but I would think this has probably

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.200 
bike but I would think this has probably
been<00:01:45.570> detuned<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.649> degree<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
been detuned to some degree because the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.819 
been detuned to some degree because the
bone<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> could<00:01:48.810> hang<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> without<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
bone think you could hang on without a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.090 
bone think you could hang on without a
sort<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> fairing<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> has<00:01:52.710> probably<00:01:52.950> got

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
sort of a fairing so has probably got

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
sort of a fairing so has probably got
softer<00:01:53.640> cams<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> making<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.869> more

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
softer cams in it and making it more

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.800 
softer cams in it and making it more
kind<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> track<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> same<00:01:56.009> time

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
kind of track but at the same time

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
kind of track but at the same time
anyway<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.409> quick<00:01:58.590> view<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> Lazare

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
