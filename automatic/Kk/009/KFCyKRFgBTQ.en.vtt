billion<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.649> deal<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.159> profit<00:01:56.549> in

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
billion in the deal and they profit in

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
billion in the deal and they profit in
like<00:01:56.759> eight<00:01:56.969> years<00:01:57.299> there's<00:01:57.840> no<00:01:57.990> guarantee

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
like eight years there's no guarantee

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
like eight years there's no guarantee
that<00:01:58.530> profit<00:01:59.250> trend<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.640> continue<00:01:59.670> though

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that profit trend will continue though

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
that profit trend will continue though
right<00:02:00.780> there's<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> saturation<00:02:01.680> point<00:02:01.860> which

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
right there's a saturation point which

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.530 
right there's a saturation point which
we'll<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.460> into<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> 3ds

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
we'll get into in a bit with the 3ds

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.319 
we'll get into in a bit with the 3ds
that<00:02:04.490> just<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.180> all

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that just because this is what all

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.510 
that just because this is what all
companies<00:02:07.079> suffer<00:02:07.409> from<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:07.890> companies

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
companies suffer from all companies

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.410 
companies suffer from all companies
think<00:02:08.759> they're<00:02:08.879> gonna<00:02:09.000> grow<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> same

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
think they're gonna grow at the same

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
think they're gonna grow at the same
rate<00:02:09.629> every<00:02:10.110> year<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.009> absolutely

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
rate every year which is absolutely

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.150 
rate every year which is absolutely
insane<00:02:11.970> yeah<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> same<00:02:13.620> profit

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
insane yeah you can have the same profit

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.590 
insane yeah you can have the same profit
margin<00:02:14.370> every<00:02:14.580> year<00:02:14.820> but<00:02:15.270> there's<00:02:15.480> no

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
margin every year but there's no

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.180 
margin every year but there's no
guarantee<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.380> you're<00:02:16.650> gonna<00:02:16.770> increase<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
guarantee that you're gonna increase the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.070 
guarantee that you're gonna increase the
same<00:02:17.550> revenue<00:02:18.060> percentage<00:02:18.630> every<00:02:18.840> year

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
same revenue percentage every year

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.120 
same revenue percentage every year
because<00:02:19.350> you're<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.710> get<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> point

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
because you're going to get the point

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.760 
because you're going to get the point
where<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:21.120> weren't<00:02:21.270> enough<00:02:21.450> customers<00:02:21.770> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
where you weren't enough customers to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.100 
where you weren't enough customers to
get<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:22.980> your<00:02:23.100> side<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.850> your<00:02:24.030> product<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
get on your side to get your product and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.080 
get on your side to get your product and
with<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.980> they<00:02:26.220> made<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.580> deal<00:02:26.820> maybe

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
with this if they made this deal maybe

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.450 
with this if they made this deal maybe
three<00:02:27.450> years<00:02:27.720> ago<00:02:27.870> or<00:02:28.170> two<00:02:28.320> years<00:02:28.350> ago<00:02:28.680> where

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
three years ago or two years ago where

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.890 
three years ago or two years ago where
it's<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.360> starting<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.630> take<00:02:30.750> off

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.660 
it's like really starting to take off
before<00:02:31.290> they<00:02:31.380> could<00:02:31.440> yeah<00:02:31.860> before<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.310> spread

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
before they could yeah before it spread

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180 
before they could yeah before it spread
out<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.030> everything<00:02:33.510> yes<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.290> now<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:35.010> just

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
out to everything yes but now they just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.680 
out to everything yes but now they just
lost<00:02:35.430> three<00:02:35.670> or<00:02:35.760> six<00:02:35.910> million<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.570> if

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
lost three or six million and what if

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.510 
lost three or six million and what if
next<00:02:36.840> year<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.170> only<00:02:37.290> makes<00:02:37.500> half<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.070> now

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
next year it only makes half of that now

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.610 
next year it only makes half of that now

other<00:03:13.890> versions<00:03:14.190> which<00:03:14.610> would<00:03:14.790> hurt<00:03:15.000> them

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
other versions which would hurt them

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.450 
other versions which would hurt them
even<00:03:15.450> more<00:03:15.660> no<00:03:16.290> why<00:03:16.950> would<00:03:17.100> there<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.370> they

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
even more no why would there be if they

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.500 
even more no why would there be if they
bought<00:03:17.610> if<00:03:17.700> they<00:03:17.790> buy<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:17.970> whole<00:03:18.180> company<00:03:18.300> if

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
bought if they buy the whole company if

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.940 
bought if they buy the whole company if

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
they buy the hook okay that's that's my

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.230 
they buy the hook okay that's that's my
question<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.760> buy<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.030> whole

as said in the article and in other

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.460 
as said in the article and in other
articles<00:06:43.880> it's<00:06:44.090> not<00:06:44.270> a<00:06:44.300> done<00:06:44.630> deal<00:06:44.900> yet<00:06:44.930> it's

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470

only<00:06:45.740> in<00:06:46.039> the<00:06:46.220> works<00:06:46.460> we<00:06:46.850> might<00:06:47.060> not<00:06:47.210> see<00:06:47.270> it

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
only in the works we might not see it

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.640
