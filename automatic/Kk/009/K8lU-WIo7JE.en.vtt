00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.400 
in my defense like I said it earlier my
work<00:03:18.730> ethic<00:03:18.910> hard<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.750> try<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.110> give<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
work ethic hard and I try to give it a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.390 
work ethic hard and I try to give it a
hundred<00:03:20.590> temperature<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.220> everyday

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
hundred temperature and everyday

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.090 
hundred temperature and everyday
everyday<00:03:22.210> practice<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.140> every<00:03:23.410> game<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.860> I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
everyday practice in every game so I

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.530 
everyday practice in every game so I
think<00:03:24.460> that's<00:03:24.610> gonna<00:03:24.790> get

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.780 

playmaker<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.930> think<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.040> depends<00:03:31.430> on<00:03:31.520> how<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
playmaker I think it depends on how the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.979 
playmaker I think it depends on how the
games<00:03:32.030> going<00:03:32.269> you<00:03:32.420> know<00:03:32.510> out<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.810> could
