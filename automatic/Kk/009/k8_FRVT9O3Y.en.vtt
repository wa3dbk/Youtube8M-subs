00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello free android friends we are in 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.140
 the second day of ifach and in berlin and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.900
 we have with us the new lg pad 8.3 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.920
 finally the entrance of lg into the world of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 the tablets we see a bet on the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.539
 design a bet on the size by the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.390
 ergonomic shape especially in this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 aluminum back 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 As you can see, it 's a part of the back 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 that is whole in aluminum with these 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 two speakers gives a very finished 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 very good respect premium and one aspect 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.620
 very good especially when we catch 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 in his hand he has a very good feeling 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 According to LG is an ideal size tablet 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.079
 now we are all told this you know 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.730
 had a 7 inch yes 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.420
 more or less in your pocket like 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.670
 occurs with the nexus 7 at 10 inches 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 were the standard sizes of inches 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.620
 already very transport and in between many 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.589
 manufacturers are launching to take off 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.539
 new models with different sizes 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.429
 as for example this one that we have today in 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:13.289
 our hands the lg pad 8.3 is what 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.420
 says the one that fits in the pocket good not 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.550
 it fits too well is a size a bit 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 large perhaps already the circulated ones in fact 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 they are too big a size 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.729
 days we have also been testing the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.780
 hesperia z ultra sounds and 6.4 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.040
 inches 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 and it's also a little bit big 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.020
 that we found in this tablet we 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 we find a processor inside 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.930
 qualcomm snapdragon 600 of 17 100 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.390
 hertz enough to move this 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.399
 tablet we could know look for something more 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.690
 powerful and cultured yes but neither is 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.909
 necessary in addition to that the screen a 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.180
 8.3 inch screen 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.060
 ips with full hd resolution is the full hd 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.610
 is that part is very important 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.979
 remember we left until 8.32 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.460
 and there in those sizes is where she 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.880
 it really shows that yes we need 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.649
 high resolutions phones less than 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.319
 5 inches with full hd resolution 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.840
 there are already we know all that is 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.230
 necessary because it seems that it can not 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.510
 be that maybe with 720p it would be a 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.950
 enough resolution to offer 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.190
 some results 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.440
 good results climbing these sizes 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.540
 of screen if we need resolutions 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.780
 older and they begin to make sense 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.540
 resolution full hd and here we notice what 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.489
 we see a screen quality the camera 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.220
 it will be appreciated worse but a quality of 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.050
 extraordinary image its operation 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.810
 very good you know this is a first 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.540
 little contact we can say but 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.190
 for now it seems that it responds very well and 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.440
 we have found ourselves interesting as 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.930
 for example it can be the connection with 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.910
 others with LG phones in which we 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.560
 Notification of notifications tells us if 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.900
 we have a call a message not 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.310
 we can answer them but or imagine 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840
 example that we are in the lounge 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 calmly navigating with our 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.099
 tablet and the phone we have another site 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.470
 loading we can receive those 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.910
 notifications directly on the tablet 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.690
 and so we will know that they are calling us 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.370
 that we have received a message in the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.520
 phone so this is the new lg 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.800
 8.3 Mat 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.440
 As you can see, it stands out for its very 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.640
 nice very nice to the touch is very 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.450
 easy to carry that yes you have to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.130
 recognize it but good portable up 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.440
 a certain point you already know remembering that it is 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.940
 a tablet that is not a good smartphone 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.520
 to watch movies to browse 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.160
 internet that serves us for more than 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.480
 take it to use it at home surely 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:51.410
 if the 10 inches was too much 7 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.540
 it was ok to go 8.3 good that's a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.060
 decision that everyone will have to make 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.090
 but it seems that it is a size as you can see 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.770
 that goes into the hand quite by the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.410
 hairs but good to use outside choose 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.570
 fit 8.3 what is new in the 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.300
 sector of the tablets we will tell you 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.150
 much sooner we will do analysis and 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.100
 you will see much more about this tablet and its 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.600
 results you already know you can read 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.310
 much more in the free dotcom android 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.310
