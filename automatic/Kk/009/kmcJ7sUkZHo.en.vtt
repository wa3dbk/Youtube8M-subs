00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
those maps you don't get to play a lot

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.890 
those maps you don't get to play a lot
because<00:00:22.789> most<00:00:23.060> people<00:00:23.270> just<00:00:23.300> vote<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:23.750> shit

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
because most people just vote the shit

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.960 
because most people just vote the shit
out<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.380> it's<00:00:25.100> not<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:25.610> bad<00:00:25.760> of<00:00:25.910> a

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
out and it's not really that bad of a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.000 
out and it's not really that bad of a
map<00:00:26.150> in<00:00:26.330> on<00:00:26.450> TDM<00:00:26.900> setting<00:00:27.290> it's<00:00:27.470> more<00:00:27.770> as

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
map in on TDM setting it's more as

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.890 
map in on TDM setting it's more as
people<00:00:28.730> don't<00:00:28.970> really<00:00:29.270> like<00:00:29.420> downturn

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
people don't really like downturn

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.679 
people don't really like downturn
because<00:00:30.260> it<00:00:30.410> has<00:00:30.620> a<00:00:30.650> horrible<00:00:31.300> flow<00:00:32.300> in<00:00:32.540> it

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
because it has a horrible flow in it

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.780 
because it has a horrible flow in it
most<00:00:33.350> of<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.649> map<00:00:33.860> is<00:00:33.890> consistent<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.700> the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
most of this map is consistent of the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.549 
most of this map is consistent of the

buildings and a lot of people like to
hide<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.720> bank<00:00:41.930> that's<00:00:42.410> why<00:00:42.530> people<00:00:42.710> don't

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
hide in the bank that's why people don't

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
might have noticed my videos lately I've

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.969 
might have noticed my videos lately I've
been<00:01:08.090> using<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.450> lot<00:01:08.479> of<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.750> m4<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.439> the

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
been using a lot of the m4 and the

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.440 
been using a lot of the m4 and the
reason<00:01:10.189> I've<00:01:10.280> been<00:01:10.310> using<00:01:10.549> a<00:01:10.700> lot<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.060> m4

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
reason I've been using a lot of the m4

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.240 
reason I've been using a lot of the m4
is<00:01:11.630> because<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.200> don't<00:01:12.380> know<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:12.979> it's

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
is because I don't know it's just it's

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.390 
is because I don't know it's just it's
just<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.909> low<00:01:14.060> rico<00:01:14.510> over<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.780> weapon<00:01:15.080> has

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
just the low rico over the weapon has

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.890 
just the low rico over the weapon has
really<00:01:16.400> got<00:01:16.610> got<00:01:17.120> me<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.510> point<00:01:17.540> where

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
really got got me to the point where

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.630 
really got got me to the point where
i've<00:01:17.990> been<00:01:18.020> really<00:01:18.440> enjoying<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.130> i<00:01:19.280> mean<00:01:19.490> i've

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
i've been really enjoying it i mean i've

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.250 
i've been really enjoying it i mean i've
been<00:01:19.880> using<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.210> fat<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.510> little<00:01:20.630> bit<00:01:20.930> as<00:01:21.049> well

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
been using the fat a little bit as well

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.740 
been using the fat a little bit as well
but<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.520> i've<00:01:22.700> just<00:01:22.850> been<00:01:23.000> doing<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.720> well

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
with so consistently it just seems like

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.330 
with so consistently it just seems like
I<00:01:26.119> hit<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.869> groove<00:01:27.229> like<00:01:27.590> ever<00:01:27.770> hit<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> groove<00:01:28.190> of

I hit a groove like ever hit a groove of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.980 
I hit a groove like ever hit a groove of
the<00:01:28.430> weapon<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:29.570> seems<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:29.840> you

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
the weapon and it just seems like you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.719 
the weapon and it just seems like you
can<00:01:30.170> just<00:01:30.200> kill<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.860> then<00:01:31.250> mounted<00:01:31.549> shot

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
can just kill and then mounted shot

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.760 
can just kill and then mounted shot
steady<00:01:31.970> kills<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.510> give<00:01:33.170> her<00:01:33.290> watch<00:01:33.500> somebody

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
steady kills I give her watch somebody

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.289

and<00:01:34.250> they're<00:01:34.430> playing<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.909> seems<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.180> the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
and they're playing that seems like the

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.730 
and they're playing that seems like the
killer<00:01:35.479> but<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:35.840> three<00:01:36.049> or<00:01:36.110> four<00:01:36.260> bullets<00:01:36.590> I

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
much of the extreme conditioning but I

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.289 
much of the extreme conditioning but I
found<00:04:00.409> that<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.859> was<00:04:00.889> killing<00:04:01.639> people<00:04:01.669> just<00:04:02.120> as

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
found that I was killing people just as

getting<00:04:05.780> kills<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.319> mean<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.590> just<00:04:06.620> didn't<00:04:07.099> get

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
getting kills I mean it just didn't get

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.899 
getting kills I mean it just didn't get
the<00:04:07.250> amount<00:04:07.639> of<00:04:07.699> kills<00:04:07.909> that<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.209> desired<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.139> to

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
the amount of kills that I desired it to

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.599 
the amount of kills that I desired it to
but<00:04:10.909> it<00:04:10.939> the<00:04:11.209> same<00:04:11.419> effect<00:04:11.949> it's<00:04:12.949> easier<00:04:13.430> to

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
but it the same effect it's easier to

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.580 
but it the same effect it's easier to
get<00:04:13.760> than<00:04:13.819> like<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.299> pave<00:04:14.479> low<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:15.019> mean<00:04:15.379> it
