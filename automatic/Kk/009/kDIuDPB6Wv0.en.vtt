00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.059
 Hello everyone, Seryogapro 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.179
 This video is about 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.150
 increasing your skill in the game ks16 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.880
 The skill can be divided into two so to speak. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.470
 subsection is shooting and tactics 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.460
 First, we will understand the shooting and so well 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.830
 trained ymca will bring you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 good result and they are yours 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.619
 headshots 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.670
 her best to train them 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.899
 maps, but it is also worth saying that not all 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 wx in shooting wet ymca also if 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.920
 for example at short distances above 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.489
 naturally you will not shoot bullets 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.809
 for this you need to train the clamp 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.600
 can be trained on ordinary ksd max i 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 I personally recommend for centuries sdm on which 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.239
 no extra plugins 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.430
 very good csdm well with shooting 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.000
 somehow figured out now turn to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 tactics 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.970
 tactic is your movement on the map once 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.280
 whale and so on to play you well 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 you need to train the reaction the reaction 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 also very important in ks16 since without 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.409
 reactions almost well you don't 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.650
 be able to do the same is the style of bosov 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.130
 in general if the horror is better 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.799
 train on the site and they 400 g or Misha 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.939
 seemingly dot com mishin ria.com 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.009
 very good site he practiced there 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.619
 also worth knowing has own 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.829
 lumbago well and also scattered 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:47.299
 You can watch them on the channel lam south rem 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:50.939
 link in the description well and now from the play 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.770
 team play is a game for a team that is not 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.190
 the fact that in this run on public 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.540
 tamp frequency 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:04.820
 you are doing in front of friends there teamplay 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.460
 it is first of all the victory of the team that is 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.650
 no need there to run from the fact that you are there 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.570
 you will fill statistics to you nobody thanks 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.120

 very well if you want to play well then 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.170
 forget in general and play better 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.820
 mixes very train game play 5 on 5 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.520
 Well, for this there are such portals 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.910
 like fast cup power pro 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.600
 well, I wear it for about 12 users 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.680
 for steam, this is again the chamfer dust arena 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.830
 live-cs well , he may still have many 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.900
 portals but these are the most famous ones 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.580
 that's all 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.180
