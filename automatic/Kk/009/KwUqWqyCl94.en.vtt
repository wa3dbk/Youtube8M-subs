uninstall and install it over and over

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
uninstall and install it over and over
it<00:01:54.869> gets<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:55.860> bit<00:01:56.130> weird<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.729> doesn't

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it gets a little bit weird it doesn't

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.280

like<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.930> all<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.820> connect

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.590 

and<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.890> will<00:02:04.220> need<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.700> do<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.120> couple<00:02:05.300> of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
and you will need to do this a couple of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.499 
and you will need to do this a couple of
tries<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.800> look<00:02:07.010> out<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.640> go<00:02:07.760> getting

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
tries you can look out and go getting

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.770 
tries you can look out and go getting
directly<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:09.680> probably<00:02:10.430> not<00:02:10.790> I'm<00:02:11.600> gonna

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
directly but probably not I'm gonna

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.720 
directly but probably not I'm gonna
check<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.710> other<00:02:12.800> server<00:02:13.190> No

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
check the other server No

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.060 
check the other server No
