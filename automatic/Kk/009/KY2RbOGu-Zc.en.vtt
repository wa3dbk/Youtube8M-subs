right now
or<00:00:46.289> what's<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.890> 3d<00:00:47.489> carbonating<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
or what's your just 3d carbonating the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
or what's your just 3d carbonating the
bottle<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:48.629> bit<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.160> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
bottle a little bit because the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.790 
bottle a little bit because the
carbonation<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.760> work<00:00:51.030> against<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.800> sorbet

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
carbonation will work against the sorbet

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
carbonation will work against the sorbet
freezing<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:54.059> bullion<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> hollow<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:55.050> not

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
freezing as bullion the hollow we're not

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.299 
freezing as bullion the hollow we're not
gonna<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.440> rid<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> alcohol<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.129> in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
gonna get rid of the alcohol because in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
gonna get rid of the alcohol because in
our<00:00:56.399> testing<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> doesn't<00:00:57.120> matter<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.710> followed

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
our testing it doesn't matter I followed

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.779 
our testing it doesn't matter I followed
what<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> thought<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> cook<00:00:59.640> off

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
what I thought was they have to cook off

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.610 
what I thought was they have to cook off
the<00:00:59.820> alcohol<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> freeze<00:01:01.440> right

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the alcohol to get it to freeze right

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.369 
the alcohol to get it to freeze right
but<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> turns<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> never<00:01:02.670> had<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.379> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
but as it turns out I never had to and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
but as it turns out I never had to and
it<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.830> makes<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> extra<00:01:05.460> delicious<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it just makes it extra delicious so I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170 
it just makes it extra delicious so I
think<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.650> D<00:01:07.770> carbonation<00:01:08.280> alone<00:01:08.549> allows<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
think the D carbonation alone allows the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.020 
think the D carbonation alone allows the
sorbet<00:01:09.450> breeze<00:01:10.070> in<00:01:11.070> our<00:01:11.220> experimenting<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
sorbet breeze in our experimenting and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
sorbet breeze in our experimenting and
that's<00:01:12.900> all<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.500> we'll<00:01:13.650> wait

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that's all we got to do so we'll wait

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
that's all we got to do so we'll wait
about<00:01:13.860> thirty<00:01:14.189> minutes<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:15.180> let<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
about thirty minutes just let the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.660 
about thirty minutes just let the
bubbles<00:01:15.810> come<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.049> fizz<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> it'll<00:01:17.610> be

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
bubbles come up fizz out and it'll be

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
bubbles come up fizz out and it'll be

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and then once that's done which we

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.289 
and then once that's done which we
already<00:01:36.299> made<00:01:36.630> let's<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> look<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
already made let's take a look at that

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.800 
already made let's take a look at that
simply<00:01:39.299> zero<00:01:39.680> very<00:01:40.680> simple<00:01:41.009> indeed<00:01:41.750> which<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
simply zero very simple indeed which I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.270 
simply zero very simple indeed which I
made<00:01:42.960> yesterday<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> keeps<00:01:43.740> well<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.130> can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
made yesterday and it keeps well you can

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.620 
made yesterday and it keeps well you can
make<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.549> days<00:01:44.790> ahead<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.210> doesn't<00:01:45.479> matter

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
make this days ahead it doesn't matter

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.460 
make this days ahead it doesn't matter
and<00:01:46.909> we'll<00:01:47.909> mix<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.540> d<00:01:48.689> carbonated<00:01:49.140> beer<00:01:49.259> with

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and we'll mix the d carbonated beer with

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.600 
and we'll mix the d carbonated beer with
the<00:01:49.560> simple<00:01:49.829> syrup<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:51.780> quarter<00:01:52.140> cup<00:01:52.320> of

freshly<00:01:53.610> squeezed<00:01:53.970> grapefruit<00:01:54.149> juice<00:01:54.570> which

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.200 
freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which
we<00:01:55.439> will<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> momentarily<00:01:56.460> it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
we will get to momentarily it's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420 
we will get to momentarily it's
obviously<00:01:57.600> easy<00:01:57.840> once<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> squeezy

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
obviously easy once you do the squeezy

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.429 
obviously easy once you do the squeezy
wheezy<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.090> combine<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> other

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
wheezy and combine that with the other

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.639 
wheezy and combine that with the other
squeezes<00:02:02.390> there's<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.810> nothing<00:02:04.259> left<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
squeezes there's really nothing left to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.620 
squeezes there's really nothing left to
do<00:02:04.770> except<00:02:05.159> throw

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630

on<00:02:09.500> 30<00:02:09.830> minutes<00:02:10.160> 30<00:02:10.280> or<00:02:10.429> 40<00:02:10.610> minutes<00:02:10.880> because

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
on 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes because

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.120 
on 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes because
it<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:11.900> an<00:02:12.050> alcohol<00:02:12.380> survey<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.770> really<00:02:12.980> this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
it is an alcohol survey it really this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.470 
it is an alcohol survey it really this
how<00:02:13.250> if<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.489> leave<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.819> in<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.940> machine<00:02:14.269> till

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
how if you leave it in the machine till

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.860 
how if you leave it in the machine till
it's<00:02:14.599> really<00:02:15.110> thick<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.970> I'm<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.269> longer<00:02:17.660> side

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
it's really thick so I'm a longer side

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.600 
it's really thick so I'm a longer side
because<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.800> doesn't<00:02:19.099> need<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> extra<00:02:19.519> time

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
because it doesn't need the extra time

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.940 
because it doesn't need the extra time
for<00:02:19.940> freezing<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.690> that's<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.380> it's<00:02:21.620> really

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
for freezing and that's it it's really

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.080 
for freezing and that's it it's really
simple<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.580> matter<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.849> finding

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
simple it was just a matter of finding

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.059 
simple it was just a matter of finding
the<00:02:23.209> right<00:02:23.269> proportions<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.050> quarter<00:02:24.950> cup

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
the right proportions so quarter cup

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.650 
the right proportions so quarter cup
grapefruit<00:02:25.459> juice<00:02:25.610> don't<00:02:26.000> go<00:02:26.239> beyond<00:02:26.510> that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
grapefruit juice don't go beyond that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.180 
grapefruit juice don't go beyond that
because<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.930> find<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.290> overpowers<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> beer

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
because I find it overpowers the beer

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.559 
because I find it overpowers the beer
that<00:02:28.340> starts<00:02:28.610> tricking<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> brain<00:02:29.120> into

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
that starts tricking the brain into

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.580 
that starts tricking the brain into
thinking<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.930> you're<00:02:30.140> actually<00:02:30.290> just

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
thinking that you're actually just

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.280 
thinking that you're actually just
eating<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.860> grape<00:02:31.040> fruit<00:02:31.280> juice<00:02:31.750> sorbet<00:02:32.750> so

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
no problem it also depends on the beer

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.539 
no problem it also depends on the beer
too<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:53.690> if<00:02:54.080> they'll<00:02:54.650> have<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.130> stronger

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
too if if they'll have a stronger

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.819 
too if if they'll have a stronger
grapefruit<00:02:55.940> flavor<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> stronger<00:02:57.049> hop<00:02:57.590> or

tiny<00:02:58.069> kind<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.730> greater<00:02:59.060> changes<00:02:59.569> all<00:02:59.750> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
tiny kind of a greater changes all the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.390 
tiny kind of a greater changes all the
time<00:02:59.870> sorbet<00:03:00.530> will<00:03:00.680> change<00:03:00.860> all<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.099> time<00:03:01.160> and
