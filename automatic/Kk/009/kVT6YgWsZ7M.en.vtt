00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.650 
Xena and today we are going to discuss
cell<00:00:15.599> theory<00:00:16.520> so<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> brief<00:00:17.910> outline<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
cell theory so a brief outline of the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.960 
cell theory so a brief outline of the
topics<00:00:19.109> we'll<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.350> discussing<00:00:19.830> today<00:00:20.160> first

topics we'll be discussing today first

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
topics we'll be discussing today first
we'll<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.300> over<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.689> modern<00:00:22.020> cell<00:00:22.289> theory<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
we'll go over the modern cell theory and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
we'll go over the modern cell theory and
exceptions<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.330> types<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.350> cells

the prokaryotic cell structure in detail

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.160 
the prokaryotic cell structure in detail
and<00:00:29.429> we'll<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.119> brief<00:00:30.599> introduction

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and we'll go into a brief introduction

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.760 
and we'll go into a brief introduction
to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> eukaryotic<00:00:32.610> cell<00:00:32.820> structure<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
to the eukaryotic cell structure and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
to the eukaryotic cell structure and
then<00:00:34.770> we'll<00:00:34.980> look<00:00:35.070> at<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.280> slide<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.840> shows

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
then we'll look at a slide that shows

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
then we'll look at a slide that shows
the<00:00:37.079> key<00:00:37.290> differences<00:00:37.770> between<00:00:37.829> prokaryotes

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the key differences between prokaryotes

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.940 
the key differences between prokaryotes
and<00:00:39.180> eukaryotes<00:00:41.570> okay<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> modern<00:00:43.559> cell

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and eukaryotes okay so the modern cell

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.430 
and eukaryotes okay so the modern cell
theory<00:00:44.160> states<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:45.660> living<00:00:46.050> things<00:00:46.079> are

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
theory states that all living things are

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
theory states that all living things are
composed<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.670> cells<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.840> cells

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
composed of one or more cells the cells

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
composed of one or more cells the cells
are<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.710> basic<00:00:49.860> structural<00:00:50.550> units<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> life

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
are the basic structural units of life

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.860 
are the basic structural units of life
and<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:51.989> made<00:00:52.140> from<00:00:52.350> pre-existing<00:00:52.860> cells

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
and they're made from pre-existing cells

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
and they're made from pre-existing cells
the<00:00:54.870> cells<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.829> same<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.190> terms<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the cells are the same in terms of the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.990 
the cells are the same in terms of the
chemical<00:00:57.210> composition<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.340> hereditary

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
chemical composition and the hereditary

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
chemical composition and the hereditary
information<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:01.140> passed<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.340> cell

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
information is passed on from one cell

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.380 
information is passed on from one cell
to<00:01:03.149> another<00:01:03.180> through<00:01:03.809> division

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
to another through division

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
to another through division
there's<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.750> energy<00:01:07.290> flow<00:01:07.560> within<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there's also energy flow within the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310 
there's also energy flow within the
cells<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.030> occurs<00:01:09.420> through<00:01:09.930> metabolism

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
cells and this occurs through metabolism

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.490 
cells and this occurs through metabolism
in<00:01:11.010> biochemistry<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:14.509> two<00:01:15.509> big<00:01:15.840> exceptions

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in biochemistry the two big exceptions

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.340 
in biochemistry the two big exceptions
to<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> cell<00:01:17.100> theory<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.729> viruses<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:18.900> do

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to the cell theory are viruses these do

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039 
to the cell theory are viruses these do
contain<00:01:19.830> cells<00:01:20.400> however<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.689> alive

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
contain cells however they are not alive

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.499 
contain cells however they are not alive
because<00:01:22.590> they're<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.430> able<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> grow<00:01:24.270> or

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
because they're not able to grow or

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.990 
because they're not able to grow or
reproduce<00:01:25.080> outside<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.920> host<00:01:26.100> cell<00:01:27.470> also

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
reproduce outside of a host cell also

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.069 
reproduce outside of a host cell also
spontaneous<00:01:30.000> generation<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.780> another

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
spontaneous generation is another

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.069 
spontaneous generation is another
exception<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.009> once<00:01:32.280> thought<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.079> cells

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
exception it was once thought that cells

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
exception it was once thought that cells
did<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> fact<00:01:34.619> arise<00:01:35.100> spontaneously<00:01:35.509> but

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
did in fact arise spontaneously but

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
did in fact arise spontaneously but
however<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.820> through<00:01:38.820> cell

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
however we know that is through cell

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.899 
however we know that is through cell
division<00:01:42.350> okay<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.710> main<00:01:43.950> two<00:01:44.430> types<00:01:44.729> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
division okay the main two types of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.999 
division okay the main two types of
cells<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.869> discuss<00:01:46.350> today<00:01:46.680> are

carbohydrate matrix which is
cross-linked<00:02:38.030> by<00:02:38.270> short<00:02:38.780> peptide<00:02:39.380> units<00:02:40.270> so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
cross-linked by short peptide units so

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.350 
cross-linked by short peptide units so
looking<00:02:42.410> at<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.680> picture<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.100> we<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.180> see

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
looking at this picture here we can see

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.510 
looking at this picture here we can see
that<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.930> cell<00:02:45.170> wall<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:45.740> classified<00:02:45.980> as

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
that the cell wall can be classified as

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.240 
that the cell wall can be classified as
either<00:02:46.640> gram<00:02:47.120> positive<00:02:47.750> or<00:02:47.990> is<00:02:48.530> gram<00:02:48.800> negative

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
either gram positive or is gram negative

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.070 
either gram positive or is gram negative
and<00:02:49.490> this<00:02:49.820> depends<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.600> how<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.970> bacteria<00:02:53.870> is

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
and this depends on how the bacteria is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.060 
and this depends on how the bacteria is
going<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.560> react<00:02:54.980> with<00:02:55.430> certain<00:02:55.760> bacterial

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
going to react with certain bacterial

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.640 
going to react with certain bacterial
antibiotics<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.540> gram<00:02:59.840> positive<00:03:00.410> is

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
antibiotics so gram positive is

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.280 
antibiotics so gram positive is
generally<00:03:01.340> thicker<00:03:01.760> cell<00:03:02.480> wall<00:03:02.720> thicker

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
generally thicker cell wall thicker

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.520 
generally thicker cell wall thicker
peptidoglycan<00:03:03.940> or<00:03:04.940> as<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.209> gram-negative

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
peptidoglycan or as the gram-negative

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.740 
peptidoglycan or as the gram-negative
bacteria<00:03:06.530> are<00:03:06.830> very<00:03:07.190> complex<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.510> they<00:03:08.600> have

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
bacteria are very complex and they have

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.220 
bacteria are very complex and they have
less<00:03:09.050> peptidoglycan<00:03:09.680> it's<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.430> bit<00:03:10.640> thinner<00:03:11.230> so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
less peptidoglycan it's a bit thinner so

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.530 
less peptidoglycan it's a bit thinner so
the<00:03:12.500> cell<00:03:12.739> wall<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.190> not<00:03:13.550> only<00:03:13.820> protects<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
the cell wall it not only protects the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.540 
the cell wall it not only protects the
cell<00:03:14.720> but<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.959> also<00:03:15.050> keeps<00:03:15.500> from<00:03:15.769> excess<00:03:16.250> water

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
cell but it also keeps from excess water

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.449 
cell but it also keeps from excess water
and<00:03:16.820> turn<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.420> cell<00:03:17.660> in<00:03:17.930> bursting<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.100> it

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
and turn the cell in bursting and it

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.490 
and turn the cell in bursting and it
also<00:03:20.560> keeps<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.709> shape<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.900> next<00:03:24.230> slide

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
also keeps a shape so this next slide

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.330 
also keeps a shape so this next slide
we're<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.400> take<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.910> look<00:03:26.239> at<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:28.100> cell

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
we're going to take a look at the cell

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.660 
we're going to take a look at the cell
wall<00:03:28.610> Gram<00:03:29.120> stain<00:03:29.330> procedure<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.489> have

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
wall Gram stain procedure so we have

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.120 
wall Gram stain procedure so we have
grande<00:03:31.940> positive<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.840> gram-negative<00:03:33.130> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
grande positive and gram-negative the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.949 
grande positive and gram-negative the
first<00:03:34.400> step<00:03:34.640> in<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:34.880> procedure<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.720> to

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
first step in this procedure is to

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.490 
first step in this procedure is to
fixate<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.709> cells<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.940> line<00:03:38.350> then<00:03:39.350> we

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
fixate the cells on this line then we

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.100 
fixate the cells on this line then we
add<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.860> crystal<00:03:40.310> violet<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.690> stains

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
add the crystal violet in this stains

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.270 
add the crystal violet in this stains
both<00:03:42.739> cells<00:03:43.100> purple<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.630> iodine<00:03:44.989> treatment

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
both cells purple the iodine treatment

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.210 
both cells purple the iodine treatment
fixates<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.880> crystal<00:03:47.299> violet

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
fixates the crystal violet

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.420 
fixates the crystal violet
unto<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:50.110> cells<00:03:51.110> then<00:03:51.890> we<00:03:51.920> have<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.160> disk

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
unto the cells then we have a disk

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.630 
unto the cells then we have a disk
colorization<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:54.110> gram-negative<00:03:54.640> you'll

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
colorization so in gram-negative you'll

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.150 
colorization so in gram-negative you'll
notice<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.810> crystal<00:03:57.470> violet<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.890> washed

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
notice that the crystal violet is washed

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.150 
notice that the crystal violet is washed
away<00:03:58.430> off<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.299> bacteria<00:03:59.920> whereas<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:01.070> the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
away off the bacteria whereas in the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.789 
away off the bacteria whereas in the
gram<00:04:01.370> positive<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.450> crystal<00:04:03.049> violet<00:04:03.170> stays

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
gram positive the crystal violet stays

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.540 
gram positive the crystal violet stays
in<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.490> cell<00:04:04.990> so<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.410> next<00:04:06.680> step<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:07.130> the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
in the cell so the next step is the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.730 
in the cell so the next step is the
counter<00:04:07.910> stain<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.420> they

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
counter stain and they

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.640 
counter stain and they
safranin<00:04:09.460> which<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.880> reddish<00:04:10.300> color<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
safranin which is a reddish color the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.220 
safranin which is a reddish color the
gram-negative<00:04:11.940> takes<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.420> safranin<00:04:13.960> and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
gram-negative takes on the safranin and

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.030 
gram-negative takes on the safranin and
stains<00:04:14.920> red<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.660> gram<00:04:16.840> positive<00:04:17.440> still

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
stains red and the gram positive still

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.160 
stains red and the gram positive still
keeps<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.460> crystal<00:04:18.850> violet<00:04:18.970> unaffected<00:04:19.960> by

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
keeps the crystal violet unaffected by

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.650 
keeps the crystal violet unaffected by
the<00:04:20.710> counter<00:04:21.130> stain<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.610> gram<00:04:21.850> positive<00:04:22.390> under

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
the counter stain so gram positive under

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.290 
the counter stain so gram positive under
a<00:04:22.690> microscope<00:04:22.870> looks<00:04:23.680> purplish<00:04:24.640> gram

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
a microscope looks purplish gram

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.710 
a microscope looks purplish gram
negative<00:04:25.720> looks<00:04:26.080> reddish<00:04:26.970> next<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.240> will<00:04:28.420> take

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
negative looks reddish next we will take

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.140 
negative looks reddish next we will take
a<00:04:28.750> look<00:04:28.990> at<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.380> cell<00:04:30.010> interior<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:30.880> the

a look at the cell interior of the
prokaryote<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:33.190> we<00:04:33.820> said<00:04:34.000> before<00:04:34.050> bacteria

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
prokaryote so as we said before bacteria

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.920 
prokaryote so as we said before bacteria
is<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.320> very<00:04:35.830> simple<00:04:36.220> structure<00:04:36.780> with<00:04:37.780> the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
is a very simple structure with the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.850 
is a very simple structure with the
plasma<00:04:38.140> membrane<00:04:38.670> but<00:04:39.670> within<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.480> cytoplasm

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
plasma membrane but within the cytoplasm

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.400 
plasma membrane but within the cytoplasm
which<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.280> oily<00:04:42.760> type<00:04:43.180> substance<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:44.140> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
membrane also facilitates cell division

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.170 
membrane also facilitates cell division
and<00:05:08.460> then<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.640> ribosomes<00:05:10.230> inside<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:12.180> inside

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
and then the ribosomes inside the inside

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.660 
and then the ribosomes inside the inside
the<00:05:13.360> cytoplasm<00:05:13.830> also<00:05:14.830> help<00:05:15.070> facilitate

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
the cytoplasm also help facilitate

and some of the differences and how the

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.119 
and some of the differences and how the
animal<00:06:39.539> style<00:06:39.750> works<00:06:40.020> versus<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:40.620> plant<00:06:40.860> so

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
animal style works versus to plant so

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.369 
animal style works versus to plant so
this<00:06:42.120> is<00:06:42.300> just<00:06:42.479> to<00:06:42.629> give<00:06:42.780> you<00:06:42.870> an<00:06:42.990> idea<00:06:43.110> of

this final slide we have here is going

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.879 
this final slide we have here is going
to<00:06:49.759> give<00:06:50.759> you<00:06:51.349> the<00:06:52.349> differences<00:06:52.830> between

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
to give you the differences between

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.920 
to give you the differences between
prokaryotes<00:06:53.759> and<00:06:54.000> eukaryotes<00:06:54.090> sometimes

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes sometimes

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.899 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes sometimes
it's<00:06:55.349> a<00:06:55.650> good<00:06:55.800> idea<00:06:56.099> to<00:06:56.280> look<00:06:56.400> at<00:06:56.520> differences

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
it's a good idea to look at differences

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.399 
it's a good idea to look at differences
side-by-side<00:06:58.699> as<00:06:59.699> you<00:06:59.880> can<00:07:00.030> see<00:07:00.270> cell<00:07:00.810> wall<00:07:01.050> is

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 
side-by-side as you can see cell wall is

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.950 
side-by-side as you can see cell wall is
found<00:07:01.860> in<00:07:02.220> prokaryotes<00:07:03.060> however<00:07:03.569> it's<00:07:03.780> a

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
found in prokaryotes however it's a

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.100 
found in prokaryotes however it's a
protein<00:07:05.090> polysaccharide<00:07:06.090> it's<00:07:06.630> also<00:07:06.840> found

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
protein polysaccharide it's also found

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.800 
protein polysaccharide it's also found
in<00:07:07.289> eukaryotes<00:07:07.889> but<00:07:08.190> in<00:07:08.460> this<00:07:08.610> case<00:07:08.880> in<00:07:09.210> plant

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
in eukaryotes but in this case in plant

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.930 
in eukaryotes but in this case in plant
cells<00:07:10.110> and<00:07:10.440> this<00:07:10.620> is<00:07:10.680> composed<00:07:11.190> in<00:07:11.400> cellulose

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
cells and this is composed in cellulose

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.230 
cells and this is composed in cellulose
so<00:07:12.330> those<00:07:12.569> are<00:07:12.750> two<00:07:12.960> main<00:07:13.139> differences<00:07:14.240> they

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
so those are two main differences they

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.740 
so those are two main differences they
both<00:07:15.599> have<00:07:15.990> cell<00:07:16.620> membranes<00:07:17.750> both

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
both have cell membranes both

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.420 
both have cell membranes both
prokaryotes<00:07:19.380> and<00:07:19.590> eukaryotes<00:07:19.680> have

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes have

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.730 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes have
ribosomes

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
ribosomes

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.740 
ribosomes
however<00:07:22.740> prokaryotes<00:07:23.460> do<00:07:23.729> not<00:07:23.940> have<00:07:24.210> membrane

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
however prokaryotes do not have membrane

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.320 
however prokaryotes do not have membrane
bound<00:07:24.930> organelles<00:07:25.229> or<00:07:26.039> as<00:07:26.219> eukaryotes<00:07:26.759> do<00:07:27.060> and

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
bound organelles or as eukaryotes do and

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.320 
bound organelles or as eukaryotes do and
in<00:07:28.139> terms<00:07:28.409> of<00:07:28.680> hereditary<00:07:29.310> information<00:07:29.490> the

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
in terms of hereditary information the
