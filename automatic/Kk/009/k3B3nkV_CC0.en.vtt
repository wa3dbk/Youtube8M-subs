to<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> pipe<00:01:16.830> thread<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.460> it'll<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
to a pipe thread so it'll go in here and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
to a pipe thread so it'll go in here and
this<00:01:20.280> does<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> inverse<00:01:21.119> goes<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> pipe

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
thread to a hose bred and I also picked

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.950 
thread to a hose bred and I also picked
up<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.580> backflow<00:01:26.580> preventer<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.450> didn't<00:01:27.780> have

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
up a backflow preventer I didn't have

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.090 
up a backflow preventer I didn't have
one<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.470> drip<00:01:29.299> originally<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> I'll<00:01:31.829> be

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
one on my drip originally so I'll be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.520 
one on my drip originally so I'll be
using<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.299> build<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> new<00:01:33.869> valve<00:01:34.290> assembly

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
using this to build a new valve assembly

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
using this to build a new valve assembly
and<00:01:36.259> we'll<00:01:37.259> give<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.579> picked<00:01:39.030> up

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and we'll give it a go I also picked up

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
and we'll give it a go I also picked up
some<00:01:39.240> sprinkler<00:01:39.930> wire<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.560> well<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:41.579> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
some sprinkler wire as well because I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.380 
some sprinkler wire as well because I
was<00:01:41.939> using<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.570> cheap<00:01:43.320> thermostat<00:01:44.100> wire<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
was using some cheap thermostat wire to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.289 
was using some cheap thermostat wire to
hook<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.930> controller<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> drip<00:01:47.970> valve

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
hook my controller up to the drip valve

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.960 
hook my controller up to the drip valve
and<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:50.159> rotted<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> sunlight

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
and it rotted because of the sunlight

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.499 
and it rotted because of the sunlight
okay<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.390> I'll<00:01:54.840> need<00:01:55.049> tough<00:01:55.500> LAN<00:01:55.740> tape<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.670> pair

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
okay so I'll need tough LAN tape a pair

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.210 
okay so I'll need tough LAN tape a pair
of<00:01:57.540> channel<00:01:57.750> lock<00:01:58.500> pliers<00:01:58.850> and

I'll hook it up to my sprinkler timer

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:48.809 
I'll hook it up to my sprinkler timer
with<00:02:29.350> these<00:02:29.590> wires

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:03:11.690 

better<00:02:49.819> replant<00:02:50.450> that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:21.720 

shut<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.730> off

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.089 

okay<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.120> wired<00:03:23.510> up<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.930> zone<00:03:24.170> 4<00:03:24.650> hard

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
okay it's just wired up to zone 4 hard

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.309 
okay it's just wired up to zone 4 hard
part<00:03:25.400> with<00:03:25.580> connecting<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.330> common<00:03:26.780> wires<00:03:26.989> to

part with connecting to common wires to
one<00:03:28.209> connection<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.989> just<00:03:30.560> ended<00:03:30.769> up

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
one connection but I just ended up

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.880 
one connection but I just ended up
twisting<00:03:31.430> them<00:03:31.580> together<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:33.200> need<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.470> plug

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
twisting them together you need to plug

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.990 
twisting them together you need to plug
the<00:03:34.130> power<00:03:34.340> back<00:03:34.519> in<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:36.280> test<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:37.700> we're

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
the power back in and test it and we're

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:56.780 
the power back in and test it and we're
all<00:03:38.090> set<00:03:46.840> there<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.870> go

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790

okay

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.130
