little about what exactly goes into that
yeah<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.450> Lensbaby<00:00:18.869> composer<00:00:18.960> Pro<00:00:19.650> with

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
yeah the Lensbaby composer Pro with

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.519 
yeah the Lensbaby composer Pro with
sweet<00:00:20.130> 35<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.509> and<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.380> it's

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
sweet 35 is what I have here and so it's

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.890 
sweet 35 is what I have here and so it's
two<00:00:22.980> main<00:00:23.220> pieces<00:00:23.489> one<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> composer<00:00:24.509> Pro

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
two main pieces one is the composer Pro

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.440 
two main pieces one is the composer Pro
which<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.560> lens<00:00:26.189> body<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.029> call<00:00:27.270> it

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
which is a lens body is what we call it

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.690 
which is a lens body is what we call it
and<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.020> other<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> sweet<00:00:28.770> 35<00:00:29.070> which<00:00:29.520> is

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
and the other is the sweet 35 which is

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.690 
and the other is the sweet 35 which is
an<00:00:29.970> optic<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.349> lensbaby<00:00:31.770> system<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
an optic and the lensbaby system is a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
an optic and the lensbaby system is a
system<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.300> has<00:00:33.720> lens<00:00:34.170> bodies<00:00:34.560> and<00:00:34.739> optics

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
system that has lens bodies and optics

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
system that has lens bodies and optics
that<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:35.970> lens<00:00:36.210> body<00:00:36.449> in<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.109> case<00:00:37.350> tilts

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that the lens body in this case tilts

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
that the lens body in this case tilts
and<00:00:38.090> focuses<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> optic<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.379> what

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and focuses and then the optic is what

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
and focuses and then the optic is what
focuses<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:41.160> light<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.519> has<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:41.879> aperture

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
focuses the light and has the aperture

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
focuses the light and has the aperture
system<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> when<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> put<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.489> I'm

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
system so when I put this in here I'm

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.599 
system so when I put this in here I'm
going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> f<00:00:45.210> 2.8<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:46.260> 2.5<00:00:46.800> rather<00:00:47.100> I'm

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
going to go to f 2.8 for 2.5 rather I'm

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.810 
going to go to f 2.8 for 2.5 rather I'm
going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> line<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.949> open<00:00:49.949> circle<00:00:50.640> with

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
going to line up the open circle with

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660 
going to line up the open circle with
the<00:00:50.850> dot<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.109> lens<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.710> click<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.280> dot<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the dot on the lens and click to dot to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.200 
the dot on the lens and click to dot to
dot<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.359> we've<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.769> certain<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:56.940> so

the optic swap system includes seven

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.279 
the optic swap system includes seven
different<00:01:00.059> optics<00:01:00.539> currently<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.170> we're

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
different optics currently and we're

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.169 
different optics currently and we're
working<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.679> a<00:01:01.710> bunch<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.760> what's<00:01:02.999> the
