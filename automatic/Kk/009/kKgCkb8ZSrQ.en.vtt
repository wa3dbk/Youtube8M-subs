00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 music and the supernatural always 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.949
 they have led hand in hand 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.259
 innumerable legends about musicians that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.980
 they have sold their soul in exchange for fame and 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.690
 fortune but there is one in particular that in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 his moment he made statements very 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.989
 controversial assuring that he had agreed 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.500
 with the devil himself and leaving him for 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.500
 written 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.980
 I am night crawler this is research 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.379
 criticism and today I will talk about giuseppe 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.379
 tartini and the trill of the devil 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.530
 Martin and he was a composer and violinist 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.899
 who was born on April 8, 1692 in a 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.049
 province of the republic of venice that 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.270
 currently belongs to slovenia being 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.450
 very young the violinist has to flee 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.700
 to the convent of san francisco in assisi 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.860
 to avoid being stopped after 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.170
 have been accused of kidnapping by a 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.119
 cardinal jealous of the relationship that 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.409
 tartini held with a young woman from her 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.000
 city and it's precisely in that place 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.000
 where tartine learned to play the violin 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 over the years he was improving his 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.060
 technique and in 1721 he was appointed teacher 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 of the chapel of the saint of Padua and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.289
 Due to his high position he could also 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.700
 play for many institutions very 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:50.340
 important and in 1726 he founded a school 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.850
 of violin with students who came from 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850
 All Europe 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.470
 it is said that one day tartini heard touch 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 the violin to the musician francesco marÃ­a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.350
 veracini and was very impressed by what 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.570
 he heard yet frustrated and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 that he was unable to play as you will see and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.490
 nor so I went locked in a room 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.300
 practice day and night to improve your 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.930
 technical shortly after their own 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.890
 fist and lyrics' was born the legend leaving 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.230
 his wonderful music and it is written 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:33.260
 for posterity tartini wrote 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.510
 one night in 1713 I dreamed about the devil he 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 He asked me to lend him my violin and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 began to play how big was my 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.670
 amazement when hearing such a sonata 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.640
 wonderful so beautiful and interpreted 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.890
 with so much art and intelligence something that 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.470
 I never would have thought about the most 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.370
 daring of my fantasies 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.290
 I felt ecstatic transported 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.290
 charmed 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.290
 I missed my breath and woke up 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.350
 I immediately grabbed my violin with 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.760
 in order to preserve at least a part of 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.370
 that melody but it was in vain 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.709
 the music that I composed at this time 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.590
 is without a doubt the best I've written in 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.780
 my life and they still call it the trill of 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.420
 Devil 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.350
 but the difference between this and the one 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.480
 listen to the same demon is so big 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.160
 that would have destroyed my instrument and 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.670
 I would have said goodbye to music for 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.690
 always if I had to live without 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.690
 the enjoyment that offers me 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.879
 the trill of the devil is still 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.940
 considered the best composition of 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.420
 tartini and you're listening to him in this 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.420
 moment 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.370
 as for the violin with which 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.960
 supposedly I touch the devil was 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.380
 inherited by the following generations 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.040
 of the musician until at some point 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.500
 he lost track 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.930
 according to the legend the violin follows 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.400
 circulating somewhere in the world and 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.099
 if it falls into the hands of a young 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.700
 violinist the devil will appear 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.730
 to offer you a pact 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.859
 and is that traditionally has always been 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.019
 considered the violin as a 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.799
 malignant instrument like the instrument 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.799
 of the devil 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.099
 as a personal opinion since 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.199
 I heard this story I thought 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.090
 fascinating and it was a great source of 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.430
 inspiration for some of my 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.620
 stories like the witch's violin by 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.750
 example 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.449
 it is certainly a pretty legend 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.650
 interesting and what made this musician 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.650
 will go down in history
