00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 And then it's okay with you guys going today. 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.710
 I'm here with another new video here 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.250
 Storm Island is not good, it's a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.120
 of the subjects in one we are going to say that generated 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 but the opposition has not elected there and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.029
 now we're talking about it right good 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 I entered brasilias and now what I do 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 apply good partner but let's 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 You 'll always have a friend in then let's go. 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.750
 over there 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.180
 good that you first come in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 he is not going to get you the expense 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 none like wood is not complete 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.980
 in situations that means 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.610
 more or less with some situations, right? 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.149
 with a strong level 1 but the subject is the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.600
 What I'm going to do is good, so you come in. 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.480
 huh 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.969
 when you enter an event in the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.850
 ekipa storm island 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.809
 You must improve the first thing. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 its strong right because the strong with 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 strong will you increase and the speed 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.280
 building in your castle would then be 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 a more useful thing at the time then 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.490
 Let's just say if a thing of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.979
 and 15 minutes with strong and improve the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.159
 level 2 will take 14 minutes or more 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.500
 less or less will depend 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.020
 of the thing you'll get 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.159
 so the first part is when you 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.500
 to get stronger and to demolish 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.630
 all the cells things that you do not go 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.820
 I use this gift and I'll take it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.479
 I'm going to close these 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.369
 to learn to leave the think 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.500
 I will not leave the farm house, I will not 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.210
 I will leave more than pink of course has 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.399
 Closed is morning, I'll leave it, too. 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.040
 tower all you do not need to improve is 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.649
 because the event only lasts 30 days later 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 30 days will everything demolish will be everything 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.530
 demolished it is over 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.450
 well I entered I want to get the pieces 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.020
 I'll do it to get these pieces. 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.190
 You're going to run after the islands of water. 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.650
 or attack these towers right 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.640
 the fortress left is the fortress of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.940
 university 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.430
 But these fortress not much not 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.730
 A lot of water, right? 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.680
 so I saw from there 7 thousand of sea water 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.190
 if I'm not mistaken, that's 7 thousand goes 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.860
 depending on the level of it of course you go 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.730
 need these piles of wood. 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.860
 You will capture them and capture them. 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.319
 be more or less the following here, huh? 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.260
 You'll put the soldiers here in the 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.459
 first wave soldered in the second wave 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.010
 place 18 of 18 milk in the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.349
 internet here on the other side 15 stairs 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.750
 tamed 15 ladder on the other side and attack 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.450
 only on the flank because you are 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.910
 taking on strength of resources and almost 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.450
 fortress fortress not resort island 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.630
 huh 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.849
 so it does not have to be very good 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.799
 You need to be very much welcomed not 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.519
 need me chapter island of 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.579
 appeal here with 90 100 healthy is 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.609
 but now we are going to spend your 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.590
 lines is that this one if you who want 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.650
 run behind the right parts 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.739
 or it will attack the fortress or else 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.359
 will capture these islands here as you 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.400
 can you see right? 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.430
 it is easy to capture these islands have a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.470
 training in our video there that I did 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.700
 It 's only you will check it in the video 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.220
 on the channel there 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.989
 information is from the storm itself 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.940
 the video name 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.440
 you returned to check there will be 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.920
 Good after that like I'm going 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.220
 sas take the sea water will produce 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.989
 sea water in the castle the islands do not 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.389
 like you there has a period is 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.849
 occupation type you have to watch and 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.730
 type after that period 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.630
 the islands the marine waters nÃ© 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.609
 badin bring an amount for your 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.640
 castle is title and more or less 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.940
 depending on the island has one of 52 thousand 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.989
 and there is one that gives 12 thousand, so it's a lot 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.350
 little 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.060
 It is better to get 52,000 but more 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.520
 difficult will need more soldiers and 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.210
 tool is not more or less that and 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.310
 after that you take the pieces 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.960
 I do not know if you had already 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.510
 You got it here, right? 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.870
 these parts here that I 'm going to show 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.740
 you here these pieces 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.590
 you may be building is the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.610
 freighter this is going to be there 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.910
 get 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.220
 I advise you to build five thousand 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.000
 still do not get 5 thousand points 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.980
 here o 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.560
 here you will see the amount of points 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.780
 on your right you have 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.919
 or else it would be my point of 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.870
 You can still leave, right? 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.460
 struggling to get both 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.810
 thousand and two hundred thousand points sometimes 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.540
 wins the pieces still earn an item 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.730
 decorative stay between the five and that's it 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.640
 I do not know if it helps if you do not 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.790
 I know if you like the video, right? 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.310
