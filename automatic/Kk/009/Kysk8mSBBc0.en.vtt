00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 speaks guys okay but not for games 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 example for you another gameplay of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.000
 the rest of the channel in the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.369
 taverna here is the new game mode 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 of the game and every week has a mode 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.839
 different, this is where the dance is. 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.720
 masks and you can read the rules 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.609
 here but I think everyone has a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 mask and when he fell he dies 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.410
 shows your true identity costs 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 two less and is ready for yesterday to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.800
 He neither fights nor four days 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.180
 For the time being I did not play it's going to be the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 first time here I'm going to come in with 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.649
 You are the first victory that people 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.649
 we win, we get a package here 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.030
 I created a half ice wizard deck here 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.859
 more or less, right 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.929
 I had to put more lackeys by 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.449
 This is why 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.339
 ice has a lot of magic and would not give it to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.980
 use the right footmen 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.199
 thanks to this way here we play and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.449
 Let's see what happens next. 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 he found the worthy opponent could play 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 with that jorge without neck that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 appeared above 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.410
 We're going to play against the priest. 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.300
 Let's hope this idec goes well. 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.540
 We always look a little like that, right? 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.860
 for fear of a new deck 2 provoke me 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.420
 I think I'm going to stay with them. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.320
 because you will see a good amount of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.360
 spell 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.550
 After I need it, it fell to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.410
 speed up a bit this idec is a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.110
 very slow because neither after the 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.920
 we will see if it will 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.930
 right 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 a dollar will respond violate no face 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 and I am not a vision of the mind and the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.490
 coin already another vision of the damn mind 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.619
 so it's okay 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:00.310
 The goalkeeper will come back here and give him 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.869
 because you did not answer me, cara 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.119
 this is not done primarily in video 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.010
 in which the list - two of damage is a 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.230
 The lackey is about to provoke me. 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.120
 but tease can hold him 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.099
 practically will be to attack or provoke 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.500
 two die he will kill the same two 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:26.690
 did not exist and destroyed my provocation and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.700
 then another score and there is an event 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.160
 Especially here at the tavern I got one 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.440
 Marujo I have invested but not 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.180
 much good because I won it in 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.140
 exchange and virtually no attack 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:46.280
 here and won the spirit play the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:48.410
 chosen cast member he left 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.530
 the fire made him strong and attacked me 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.139
 Right, you're kind of aggressive and a priest. 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.549
 it overflows the freeze the fire the fact 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.980
 I can already give him a fireball 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.930
 that's what I'm going to do 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.690
 fire ball could kill the fact fire 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.590
 him with the ice spear that would be what 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.290
 I was going to do 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.450
 If I had the right dec, I do not know 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.180
 was the standard ice wizard that the game 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.819
 I was not going to do it but like this one did not 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.440
 it's full in this weird way I'm going 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.440
 guard and defense and stuck fire fact 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.210
 Does not he have some good cards in the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.040
 good or he's just that your face right or 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:41.580
 freeze it again with the elemental of 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:45.450
 I'm going to attack him and gain time, right? 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.600
 the defrost is thus the deck very slow despite 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.160
 that until the internship is destroyed my 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.410
 I did not get it. 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.709
 decreased the cost of my magic without 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.950
 want 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.950
 what a beauty 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.890
 I'm going to attack the fire, do it again. 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.560
 received the scenario where she fell with the 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.340
 Last breath destroy the people fact 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.470
 see play or provoke cheaper here 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.630
 Procon in turn I can use alex 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.460
 Might already on maybe I can even kill 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.270
 he next turn may well lower 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.030
 his life 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.470
 Come on, man, do not destroy the portal. 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.150
 Otherwise you're going to end up with mine. 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.830
 It 's strange that my strategy is that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.830
 It's good to win from others. 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.640
 jarbas right 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.640
 come on then slows and alex 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.880
 - Life for you attacks 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.690
 if I had two ice spears 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:04.910
 cause more damage to him but okay? 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:08.050
 I sold everything then the legendary 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.050
 he held 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.340
 it will reduce the cost of his cards 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:21.080
 Look man, too. I think he got lost. 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.000
 in an extra hour of taca plus one me 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.350
 I can even kill myself, just buy the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.930
 attacker gave a little time even provoke 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.930
 and sure of ice spear of ice 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.950
 there we have won and now we 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:47.120
 will win a deck nÃ© victory there pack 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.100
 received and we will open it come 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.070
 giving total I won some rewards 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.070
 then the nurseries will open the package 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:10.440
 There, the public is just in front of her. 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.150
