against a few guys who knew who i was in
the<00:00:09.870> lobby<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.980> them<00:00:11.099> actually

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
the lobby and one of them actually

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.820 
the lobby and one of them actually
suggested<00:00:11.880> they<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> DSR<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> want<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> see

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
suggested they use a DSR I want to see

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220 
suggested they use a DSR I want to see
how<00:00:13.950> good<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.370> can<00:00:14.400> do<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> DSR<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.199> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
how good you can do with the DSR so I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.740 
how good you can do with the DSR so I
figured<00:00:16.770> why<00:00:16.890> not<00:00:16.920> try<00:00:17.460> out<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.970> DSR<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.660> when

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
figured why not try out the DSR but when

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
figured why not try out the DSR but when
I<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> min<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.890> will<00:00:20.130> notice<00:00:20.340> why

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
I a min right here you will notice why

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820 
I a min right here you will notice why
this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> weird<00:00:21.840> game<00:00:21.990> play<00:00:22.230> there's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this is just a weird game play there's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
this is just a weird game play there's
literally<00:00:23.160> no<00:00:23.550> scope<00:00:23.970> whenever<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.720> min<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
literally no scope whenever I a min and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.410 
literally no scope whenever I a min and
I'm<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.420> literally

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I'm like what is going on literally

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.210 
I'm like what is going on literally
every<00:00:27.539> single<00:00:27.840> time<00:00:28.289> after<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> died<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.130> was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
every single time after I died it was

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
every single time after I died it was
the<00:00:29.340> exact<00:00:29.640> same<00:00:29.849> way<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> even<00:00:30.929> after<00:00:31.289> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the exact same way and even after this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.490 
the exact same way and even after this
game<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.189> kept<00:00:33.030> using<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> DSR<00:00:33.840> trying<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> see

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
game I kept using the DSR trying to see

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
game I kept using the DSR trying to see
if<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.860> switch<00:00:35.219> back<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.000> did<00:00:36.149> not

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
if it would switch back and it did not

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.760 
if it would switch back and it did not
switch<00:00:36.540> back<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.079> people<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.559> had

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
switch back and I know people have had

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.490 
switch back and I know people have had
issues<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> past<00:00:39.450> where<00:00:39.840> maybe

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
issues with this in the past where maybe

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.830 
issues with this in the past where maybe
like<00:00:40.980> switching<00:00:41.340> classes<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:42.210> work<00:00:42.510> but

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
like switching classes would work but

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.869 
like switching classes would work but
literally<00:00:43.170> every<00:00:43.620> single<00:00:43.649> time<00:00:44.280> i<00:00:44.309> use<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
literally every single time i use the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
literally every single time i use the
DSR<00:00:45.329> no<00:00:45.510> matter<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.809> i<00:00:45.870> pick<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
DSR no matter if i pick it up off the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.330 
DSR no matter if i pick it up off the
ground<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.829> zoomed<00:00:50.190> in

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
ground or what it was you know zoomed in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.770 
ground or what it was you know zoomed in
like<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.910> no<00:00:51.030> scope<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.449> i<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.690> know

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
like this with no scope so i don't know

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.139 
like this with no scope so i don't know
what<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.280> what's<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
what it is what's going on with it I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.830 
what it is what's going on with it I
guess<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:55.280> they're<00:00:56.280> finally<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
guess I they're finally you know on

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
guess I they're finally you know on
their<00:00:57.960> last<00:00:58.199> leg<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.949> treyarch<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> DSR

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
their last leg at treyarch with the DSR

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.819 
their last leg at treyarch with the DSR
they're<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.109> trying<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> completely

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
they're just trying to completely

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
they're just trying to completely
destroy<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.210> probably<00:01:03.300> just

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
destroy it but I know it's probably just

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.800 
destroy it but I know it's probably just
a<00:01:03.690> glitch<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.650> uh<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.689> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
a glitch that uh you know this just in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.850 
a glitch that uh you know this just in
the<00:01:06.930> game<00:01:07.049> i'm<00:01:07.260> pretty<00:01:07.470> sure<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:07.770> be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the game i'm pretty sure it would be

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
the game i'm pretty sure it would be
fine<00:01:07.890> fairly<00:01:08.729> soon<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.990> account<00:01:10.170> i<00:01:10.380> don't

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
fine fairly soon from my account i don't

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.600 
fine fairly soon from my account i don't
know<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:10.979> though<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.400> literally

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
know what it is though but literally

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
know what it is though but literally
every<00:01:11.880> time<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> pick<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> thought<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
every time I pick it up but I thought it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.929 
every time I pick it up but I thought it
would<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.830> fun<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> try<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.760> see

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
would be fun just to try it out and see

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
would be fun just to try it out and see
if<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> could<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> gameplay<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.259> didn't

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
if I could get a gameplay so I didn't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
if I could get a gameplay so I didn't
even<00:01:16.619> bother<00:01:16.890> switching<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> only

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
even bother switching because the only

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.170 
even bother switching because the only
dis<00:01:18.659> our<00:01:18.869> class<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.259> had<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.770> overkill<00:01:20.340> DSR

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
dis our class I had was my overkill DSR

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.749 
dis our class I had was my overkill DSR
ballista<00:01:21.720> class<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> end<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.460> off<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
ballista class but I end up going off in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
ballista class but I end up going off in
this<00:01:23.850> game<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.840> really

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this game this was actually a really

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.550 
this game this was actually a really
really<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:25.590> gameplay<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.840> only<00:01:27.840> died<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> few

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
really good gameplay I only died a few

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
really good gameplay I only died a few
times<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.360> sort<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:31.290> on

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
times and you know I just sort of go on

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
times and you know I just sort of go on
like<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> nice<00:01:31.770> 15<00:01:32.189> kill<00:01:32.430> streak<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.909> towards

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
like a nice 15 kill streak here towards

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
like a nice 15 kill streak here towards
the<00:01:33.299> end<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.229> finish<00:01:34.470> off<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> game<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the end to finish off the game so

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.370 
the end to finish off the game so
overall<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> very<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:37.049> good

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
overall this is a very very good

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
overall this is a very very good
free-for-all<00:01:37.890> gameplay<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> fact

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
free-for-all gameplay and just the fact

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.770 
free-for-all gameplay and just the fact
that<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:41.040> scope<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.729> basically<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.509> even

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that the the scope is basically not even

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
that the the scope is basically not even
there<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.829> zoomed<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.030> know

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
there I just zoomed in like I don't know

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.929 
there I just zoomed in like I don't know
what<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.659> about<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.490> almost

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
what it is about it but it was it almost

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.080 
what it is about it but it was it almost
was<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.079> even<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.159> enjoyable<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
was just like I even more enjoyable to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.020 
was just like I even more enjoyable to
actually<00:01:51.600> play<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> DSR<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.759> because

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
actually play with the DSR just because

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.850 
actually play with the DSR just because
it<00:01:54.329> was<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> lot<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:54.869> challenging<00:01:55.229> i<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it was a lot more challenging i know the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.819 
it was a lot more challenging i know the
DSR<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.729> terrible<00:01:57.180> now<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.020> even<00:01:58.469> with

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
DSR is just terrible now but even with

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.280 
DSR is just terrible now but even with
this<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.520> made<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.790> fun<00:02:00.270> trying<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> get

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this it just made it fun trying to get

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.800 
this it just made it fun trying to get
kills<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.100> i<00:02:02.490> actually<00:02:02.909> ended<00:02:03.540> up

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
kills with it and i actually ended up

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.380 
kills with it and i actually ended up
getting<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> pretty<00:02:04.500> nice<00:02:04.710> shot<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
getting a pretty nice shot with it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
getting a pretty nice shot with it
towards<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> end<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
towards the you know the end of the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.100 
towards the you know the end of the
video<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.720> after

that one lightning strike kill and the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.699 
that one lightning strike kill and the
rest<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.660> these<00:02:15.720> kills<00:02:15.990> are<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.350> straight

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
rest of these kills are just straight

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.610 
rest of these kills are just straight
straight<00:02:17.400> streaking<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> wind<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.440> this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
straight streaking for the wind so this

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
straight streaking for the wind so this
I<00:02:19.910> my<00:02:20.910> shot<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.360> gets<00:02:21.540> pretty<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:22.050> here<00:02:22.319> uh<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
I my shot it gets pretty on here uh in a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.240 
I my shot it gets pretty on here uh in a
little<00:02:24.510> bit<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:24.959> um<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.500> don't<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.160> how

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
little bit but um I don't know how

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.030 
little bit but um I don't know how
hopefully<00:02:26.670> uh<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.600> know<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.410> DSR<00:02:28.860> is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
hopefully uh you know I know the DSR is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.300 
hopefully uh you know I know the DSR is
done<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.790> don't<00:02:30.060> even<00:02:30.239> use<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.420> anymore

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
done with I don't even use it anymore

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.380 
done with I don't even use it anymore
like<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> said<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.730> know<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.910> only<00:02:33.000> reason<00:02:33.090> I

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
like I said you know the only reason I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.690 
like I said you know the only reason I
even<00:02:33.420> used<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> DSR<00:02:34.319> for<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.680> gameplay<00:02:34.920> was

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
even used the DSR for this gameplay was

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.090 
even used the DSR for this gameplay was
because<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.209> guy<00:02:36.390> said<00:02:36.810> hey<00:02:37.020> use<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.709> DSR<00:02:38.069> I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
because that guy said hey use the DSR I

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.130 
because that guy said hey use the DSR I
want<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.340> see<00:02:38.459> how<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> would<00:02:39.959> not

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
want to see how you do so I would not

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140 
want to see how you do so I would not
have<00:02:40.260> even<00:02:40.350> found<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.100> probably<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.850> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
have even found this out probably for a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.530 
have even found this out probably for a
while<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.819> guy<00:02:45.060> hadn't<00:02:45.390> said

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
while if you know that guy hadn't said

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.270 
while if you know that guy hadn't said
anything<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:46.170> would<00:02:46.440> definitely<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.860> use<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
anything I would definitely not use the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.750 
anything I would definitely not use the
DSR<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> uh<00:02:48.980> I'm<00:02:49.980> kind<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.250> hoping<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.550> stays

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
DSR and uh I'm kind of hoping it stays

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.430 
DSR and uh I'm kind of hoping it stays
like<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.330> know<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> actually<00:02:52.050> start

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
like this you know I actually start

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.860 
like this you know I actually start
using<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.709> DSR<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> lot<00:02:53.280> more<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.600> like

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
using the DSR a lot more if it is like

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.690 
using the DSR a lot more if it is like
this<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.560> try<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.800> hit<00:02:56.100> cliffs<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:56.580> it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
this just to try and hit cliffs with it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.000 
this just to try and hit cliffs with it
because<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:58.200> know<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.620> trying<00:02:58.709> to

videos even more enjoyable and stuff
like<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.220> little<00:03:05.730> glitches<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.690> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
like this little glitches like this I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.190 
like this little glitches like this I
can<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.709> just<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.760> have

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
can do just that you know if you have

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.840
