00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
think he just showed a bit of that the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.920 
think he just showed a bit of that the
other<00:00:41.489> day<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.940> think<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.719> harsh

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
other day I think that's a bit harsh

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.680 
other day I think that's a bit harsh
really<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.350> him<00:00:43.469> thinking<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.570> was

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really on him thinking you know that was

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
really on him thinking you know that was
something<00:00:45.719> nothing<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.289> would<00:00:46.350> liberate

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
something nothing that would liberate

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.100 
something nothing that would liberate
him<00:00:46.800> quite<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> few<00:00:47.190> years<00:00:47.340> ago<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.110> I've

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000 
cry I think we played like that
Ukrainians<00:02:42.720> difficult<00:02:43.109> game<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.500> you

ethic<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> team<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.040> tried<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.370> win<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
ethic of the team we tried to win the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.819 
ethic of the team we tried to win the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
game to the 90th minute at the end so

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.770 
game to the 90th minute at the end so
there<00:02:50.370> was<00:02:50.489> certainly<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.909> determination<00:02:51.510> from

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
there was certainly a determination from

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.199 
there was certainly a determination from
us<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.049> put<00:02:52.230> everything<00:02:52.409> kin<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.790> think<00:02:54.030> as

us to put everything kin and I think as

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.640 
us to put everything kin and I think as

you drop your standards when you relax

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.089 
you drop your standards when you relax
for<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.659> minute<00:02:57.900> even<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> game's<00:02:58.950> lone

have to keep moving forward all the time

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.860 
have to keep moving forward all the time
and<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:02.849> what<00:03:03.030> we've<00:03:03.150> tried<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.750> in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
and that's what we've tried to do in

and that's what we've tried to do in
this<00:03:03.989> get<00:03:04.349> together<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.829> think<00:03:05.190> Rios

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
this get together I think Rios

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.199 
this get together I think Rios
consistency<00:03:06.299> along<00:03:07.170> with<00:03:07.319> John<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.920> last

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
consistency along with John in the last

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.610 
consistency along with John in the last
four<00:03:09.209> or<00:03:09.299> five<00:03:09.359> years<00:03:09.510> puts<00:03:09.959> them<00:03:10.170> right<00:03:10.379> at

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
four or five years puts them right at

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.140 
four or five years puts them right at
the<00:03:10.680> top<00:03:10.859> in<00:03:11.040> center<00:03:11.370> house<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> world<00:03:11.940> for

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
the top in center house in the world for

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.449 
the top in center house in the world for
me<00:03:12.260> that's<00:03:13.260> not<00:03:13.440> biased<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.920> think<00:03:14.099> if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.280> ask

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
me that's not biased I think if you ask

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.860 
me that's not biased I think if you ask
anyone<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.940> Europe<00:03:15.209> about<00:03:15.389> them<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.690> they'll

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
anyone in Europe about them so they'll

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.930 
anyone in Europe about them so they'll
say<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.199> same<00:03:16.379> thing<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.609> think<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:17.910> know

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
say the same thing and I think you know

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.879 
say the same thing and I think you know
so<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.299> fortunate<00:03:18.720> now<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.079> there<00:03:19.319> seems<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
so I'm fortunate now that there seems to

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.189 
so I'm fortunate now that there seems to
be<00:03:20.040> at<00:03:20.220> times<00:03:20.459> always<00:03:20.849> one<00:03:21.150> player<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:21.720> couple

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
be at times always one player or couple

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.619 
be at times always one player or couple
of<00:03:22.290> players<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.650> are<00:03:23.250> taking<00:03:23.639> stick<00:03:23.910> at<00:03:24.510> any

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
of players that are taking stick at any

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.479 
of players that are taking stick at any
one<00:03:24.840> time<00:03:24.919> doesn't<00:03:25.919> have<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.099> be<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.370> I

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
one time doesn't have to be like that I

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.559 
one time doesn't have to be like that I
think<00:03:26.669> we<00:03:26.730> need<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.879> get<00:03:27.030> behind<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.419> blue

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
think we need to get behind a blue

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.890 
think we need to get behind a blue
players<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:28.560> certainly<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.129> big<00:03:29.280> player

mistakes and hopefully we can make
mistakes<00:03:40.440> when<00:03:40.620> they<00:03:40.680> don't<00:03:40.799> matter<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.069> much

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
mistakes when they don't matter so much

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.729 
mistakes when they don't matter so much

percent<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.340> will<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.579> have<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:47.879> an

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
percent that we will now have what an

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.879 
percent that we will now have what an
honest<00:03:48.239> player<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.900> person<00:03:49.079> I'm<00:03:49.379> always<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
honest player and person I'm always the

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.589 
honest player and person I'm always the
ways<00:03:50.040> conducts<00:03:50.669> himself<00:03:50.790> right<00:03:51.209> his<00:03:51.299> career
