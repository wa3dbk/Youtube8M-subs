00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.630
 we start from the basic position for 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.990
 turn with our eta 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.240
 again the arm the hand that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.219
 naturally in front of the strings 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.990
 we assign to each of the fingers of 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:23.480
 our our right hand 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.390
 a rope in this case we're going to do 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.869
 first second and third string and the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.980
 thumb touched the difference with an arpeggio 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.010
 is that 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.579
 the fingers 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.109
 index and middle finger and ring finger 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.480
 simultaneously the same ones we 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.760
 generating in the alternation between 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.410
 thumb and the rest of the fingers then 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.410
 the position is 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.140
 the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.620
 Y 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.620
 Y 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.540
 We will get the pulse by the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.540
 finger flexion 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.330
 and we can accompany we can accompany 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.610
 with a little bit of the hand in the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.430
 case of arpeggios was not practicable 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.460
 withdraw your hand because you can press 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 with a note immediately I had to 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.570
 see another finger in this case we are 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.270
 working with usually a lot 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:37.660
 more space between a blow 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 then I press injury but there is a 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.270
 little firm to the sound withdrawing 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.649
 Y 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.649
 then we can prove it 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:59.370
 I'm making him relax 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.370
 at the tip 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.410
 and it's OK 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.410
 I can do it without leaving my thumb 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.670
 when we keep a finger 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.810
 always on the guitar the hand is so 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.700
 clear and has a point of reference 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.360
 then how to start would be 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360
 interesting
