00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:16.139
 It was here, people are saying, what are you talking about? 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.449
 what are all welcome to another 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.940
 video on today's video I bring it to you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.890
 a game play the black ops 1 playing in the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.290
 map in the yard and this one is a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.230
 tennis match is a good play 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.910
 interesting for you guys will like it a lot 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.039
 and in the last few videos after I finished 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 after bringing a capital too right 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.859
 m3 fashion staff was 2 was 4 and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.839
 now the map is growing in total 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.850
 in the original game of the series that the black 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.800
 ops 1 while you follow the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.499
 All gameplay would like to hit a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.409
 I talk to you about identity 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.809
 between ended up creating players prizes 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.969
 in relation to the black box one ne 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.710
 as everyone knows is the other black 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.649
 option was the first big game of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.749
 success and treyarch escom are over 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.600
 hitting her mother was able to make a 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.309
 great franchise a great series and with 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
 this they ended up getting the success 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.690
 in the nick of time and with a bit of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.840
 decay and the series strong modules 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.340
 especially at the doors 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 treyarch eventually released the black ops 2 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.909
 opinion has lost some of the identity of the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.880
 series has lost focus a bit 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.130
 I believe it attracts the cable. 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.259
 I do not know if it is mirroring a little in the series 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.390
 motorsport 3 eventually spread 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.819
 But let's just say they made a very 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.819
 much faster faster full of 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.289
 technologies of things that in my 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.959
 opinion there was no need to 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.310
 deploy in the game despite the theme of 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.679
 black ops two are one more theme 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.869
 Futuristic, I do not believe they end up 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.060
 extrapolating in some respects 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.369
 in my point of view to tread that 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.159
 ended up losing a bit the focus is on 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.840
 series the I found the black ops a game 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.069
 much more cadenced much more 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 balanced 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.060
 closing the skill the score of the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.129
 match 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.719
 at the mercy of the players is the one 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:04.789
 be able to a little skill 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.920
 better than the other one who knows 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.789
 better position and could have a 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 Most advanced game perception and charm 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.569
 It was faster, it's always been 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.269
 highlighting and getting through that 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.829
 black ops 2 is also unbalanced today 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.840
 does that do it part 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.940
 but I do not think it depends much on the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.109
 player and yes depends much more 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.510
 combination of parts to tactics and things 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.790
 which you may end up putting in soft 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.489
 As you know the scoreboard options is a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.859
 game that has many target assists 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.170
 to park faster aiming for 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.750
 here's why there and that ended up doing 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.220
 I walk a lot so the guys play that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.440
 cool is cool, why does it end? 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.180
 encouraging the younger crowd who are 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.860
 always coming into the series to play 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.489
 because it facilitates the life of those 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.890
 people 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.470
 but in my point of view it ends up leaving 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.390
 the game a little more annoying because it takes the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.340
 main focus of the multiplayer game that is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.720
 the ability of the player who finishes 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.000
 passing this ability ends 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.010
 transferring the ability of resources 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.050
 that the game provides online forum 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.180
 compensation that does not want to 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.880
 details and this ends up undermining 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.440
 more in time of a good gameplay 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.660
 so I wanted you to leave the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.519
 Your opinion in the comments 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.830
 The problem is that you find training and 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.260
 ended up losing its identity to the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.110
 launch the black ops 21 she continues with the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.360
 your own identity and black ops 3 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.190
 will be a great success as 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.560
 theoretically to train that you think the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.760
 black ops 2 is a success today that's it 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.010
 I hope you guys liked it. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.769
 video thank you very much for the company 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.610

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.610
 bye to you went
