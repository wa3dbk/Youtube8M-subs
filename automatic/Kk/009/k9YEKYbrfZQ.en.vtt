next<00:01:06.550> we're<00:01:06.760> going<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.910> depth<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:07.960> we're

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
next we're going to depth it so we're

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.800 
next we're going to depth it so we're
going<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.200> flip<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.560> router<00:01:08.770> over<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:10.060> we're

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
going to flip the router over and we're

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.720 
going to flip the router over and we're
going<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.140> depth<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.920> down<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.490> it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
going to depth it down so that it

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.520 
going to depth it down so that it
follows<00:01:13.150> out<00:01:13.390> on<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.750> workpiece<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.380> we're

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
follows out on the workpiece that we're

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.970 
follows out on the workpiece that we're
using<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.840> lock<00:01:17.020> lever<00:01:17.320> which<00:01:17.830> is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.190 
using so we have the lock lever which is
going<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.280> release<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:19.240> clamps<00:01:19.690> which<00:01:19.930> allow

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
going to release the clamps which allow

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.520 
going to release the clamps which allow
on<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.470> router<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.830> plunge<00:01:21.100> up<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.150> down

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the appropriate death now I'm going to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.030 
the appropriate death now I'm going to
use<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.880> supplied<00:02:15.240> scale<00:02:15.660> I'm<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.740> zero

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
use the supplied scale I'm going to zero

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.150 
use the supplied scale I'm going to zero
it<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.960> showing<00:02:19.260> me<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.980> I'm

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it out so that it's showing me that I'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.760 
it out so that it's showing me that I'm
right<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.610> zero<00:02:20.880> here<00:02:21.210> then<00:02:21.870> I'm<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.650> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
right at a zero here then I'm going to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.650 
right at a zero here then I'm going to
with<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> bottom<00:02:23.700> though<00:02:23.850> everything<00:02:24.390> set

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.290 
knob I'm going to raise my bar here up
to<00:02:35.070> let's<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:36.060> about<00:02:36.870> 3/8<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:37.770> inch<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.180> I'm

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
to let's do about 3/8 of an inch so I'm

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.110 
to let's do about 3/8 of an inch so I'm
using<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> scale<00:02:40.020> I've<00:02:40.470> moved<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.010> up<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.460> 3/8

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
using the scale I've moved it up to 3/8

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.620 
using the scale I've moved it up to 3/8
of<00:02:42.240> an<00:02:42.360> inch

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
