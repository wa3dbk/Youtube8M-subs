talking<00:02:18.410> through<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.030> sf50<00:02:20.030> satellite<00:02:20.770> um

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
talking through the sf50 satellite um

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.940 
talking through the sf50 satellite um
back<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:22.850> March<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.840> last<00:02:24.140> year<00:02:24.610> for<00:02:25.610> k8y<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> see

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
back in March of last year for k8y I see

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.610 
back in March of last year for k8y I see
and<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:29.360> was<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.600> coolest<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:30.230> coolest

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and that was the coolest like coolest

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.200 
and that was the coolest like coolest
day<00:02:30.920> ever<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.550> right<00:02:31.670> after<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.060> had

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
day ever if that was right after I had

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.450 
day ever if that was right after I had
gotten<00:02:32.390> into<00:02:32.600> ham<00:02:33.470> radio<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:34.340> had

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
gotten into ham radio and I just had

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.060 
gotten into ham radio and I just had
this<00:02:34.610> one<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.910> my<00:02:35.000> car<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.500> was<00:02:36.860> pretty

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
this one in my car but that was pretty

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.270 
this one in my car but that was pretty
cool<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.360> run<00:02:38.570> these<00:02:38.780> radios<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.560> am

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
cool but to run these radios I am

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.890 
cool but to run these radios I am
running<00:02:40.520> them<00:02:40.820> off<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.300> separate<00:02:41.690> battery

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
running them off of a separate battery

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.610 
running them off of a separate battery
here<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.590> sorry<00:02:43.130> for<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> mess

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
here it is sorry for the mess

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.470 
here it is sorry for the mess
but<00:02:45.620> uh<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:47.360> run<00:02:48.200> through<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> 90<00:02:49.190> amp<00:02:49.480> battery

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
but uh it's run through a 90 amp battery

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.060 
but uh it's run through a 90 amp battery
isolator<00:02:51.020> which<00:02:51.350> I'll<00:02:51.500> show<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:51.800> just<00:02:51.920> a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
isolator which I'll show you in just a

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.070 
isolator which I'll show you in just a
second<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.030> did<00:02:53.210> this<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.810> if<00:02:53.930> I'm

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
second and I did this so that if I'm

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.390 
second and I did this so that if I'm
playing<00:02:54.320> with<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.590> radios<00:02:54.950> while<00:02:55.130> having<00:02:55.370> a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
playing with the radios while having a

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.430 
playing with the radios while having a
truck<00:02:55.610> off<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.090> won't<00:02:56.270> be<00:02:56.480> pulling<00:02:56.990> off<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.350> my

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
truck off I won't be pulling off of my

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.380 
truck off I won't be pulling off of my
truck<00:02:57.680> battery<00:02:58.070> when<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.550> crank<00:02:58.820> up<00:02:59.000> my<00:02:59.150> truck

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
truck battery when I crank up my truck

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.000 
truck battery when I crank up my truck
it<00:02:59.570> charges<00:02:59.990> this<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.410> when<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> turn<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:00.920> off

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
it charges this and when I turn it off

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.950 
it charges this and when I turn it off
it<00:03:01.280> isolates<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:02.060> battery<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.660> it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
it isolates this battery so that it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.590 
it isolates this battery so that it's
like<00:03:03.230> by<00:03:03.530> itself<00:03:03.880> also<00:03:04.880> cuts<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.270> whole<00:03:05.450> lot

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
like by itself also cuts out a whole lot

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.560 
like by itself also cuts out a whole lot
of<00:03:05.720> noise<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:10.459> mount<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.420> battery

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
of noise and to mount the battery

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.770 
of noise and to mount the battery
isolator<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:13.010> had<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.610> relocate<00:03:14.030> my<00:03:14.510> cruise

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
isolator we had to relocate my cruise

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.540 
isolator we had to relocate my cruise
control<00:03:15.200> my<00:03:15.380> food<00:03:15.590> control<00:03:15.920> was<00:03:16.220> put<00:03:16.520> right

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
control my food control was put right

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.199 
control my food control was put right
there

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
there

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.330 
there
but<00:03:17.540> there's<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.900> isolator<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.800> moko

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
but there's the isolator it's a moko

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.990 
but there's the isolator it's a moko
battery<00:03:20.000> isolator<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:21.650> massive<00:03:22.190> aluminum

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
battery isolator the massive aluminum

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.820 
battery isolator the massive aluminum
heatsink<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:24.070> but<00:03:25.070> uh<00:03:26.170> basically<00:03:27.170> what<00:03:27.709> it

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
heatsink on it but uh basically what it

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.440 
heatsink on it but uh basically what it
does<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.400> hook<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:29.150> hook<00:03:29.330> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
does is it hook it you hook the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.000 
does is it hook it you hook the
alternator<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.850> then<00:03:31.850> run<00:03:32.180> your

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
alternator to it and then run your

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.790 
alternator to it and then run your
battery<00:03:34.010> cables<00:03:35.020> which<00:03:36.020> actually<00:03:36.590> wasn't

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
battery cables which actually wasn't

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.460 
battery cables which actually wasn't
that<00:03:36.980> hard<00:03:37.130> at<00:03:37.459> all<00:03:37.750> but<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:38.780> run<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:39.320> battery

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
that hard at all but I run your battery

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.830 
that hard at all but I run your battery
cables<00:03:39.920> which<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.370> clean<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:41.660> it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
cables which I'm you to clean that to it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.900 
cables which I'm you to clean that to it
so<00:03:42.230> basically<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:43.010> splits<00:03:43.340> your<00:03:43.489> alternator

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
so basically it's splits your alternator

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.000 
so basically it's splits your alternator
power<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.660> goes<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.050> there<00:03:45.230> half<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.890> goes

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
power it goes to there half of it goes

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.729 
power it goes to there half of it goes
to<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.489> battery<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:46.910> half<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.300> it<00:03:47.420> goes<00:03:47.570> to

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
to that battery and half of it goes to

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.170 
to that battery and half of it goes to
the<00:03:48.739> other<00:03:48.860> battery<00:03:49.220> until<00:03:49.340> once<00:03:49.640> charged<00:03:49.910> and

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the other battery until once charged and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.699 
the other battery until once charged and
then<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.570> just<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.530> balances<00:03:52.040> them<00:03:52.390> but<00:03:53.390> uh

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
then it just it balances them but uh

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.020 
then it just it balances them but uh
yeah<00:03:54.709> those<00:03:54.950> aren't<00:03:55.190> those<00:03:55.400> not<00:03:55.640> too<00:03:55.820> bad

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
yeah those aren't those not too bad

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.240 
yeah those aren't those not too bad
they're<00:03:56.239> like<00:03:56.390> 30<00:03:56.900> 30<00:03:57.470> watts<00:03:57.739> or<00:03:57.920> whatnot<00:03:58.100> you

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
they're like 30 30 watts or whatnot you

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.160 
they're like 30 30 watts or whatnot you
can<00:03:58.550> look<00:03:58.850> up<00:03:58.970> on<00:03:59.120> Amazon<00:03:59.330> they<00:03:59.840> worked<00:04:00.019> really

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
can look up on Amazon they worked really

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.009 
can look up on Amazon they worked really
well<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:01.310> I've<00:04:02.030> never<00:04:02.150> had<00:04:02.390> any<00:04:02.540> problem<00:04:02.900> out

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
well and I've never had any problem out

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.470 
well and I've never had any problem out
of<00:04:03.050> it

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
of it

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.030 
of it
but<00:04:05.410> uh<00:04:05.640> yeah<00:04:06.640> that's<00:04:06.970> my<00:04:08.400> ham<00:04:09.400> radio<00:04:09.730> set<00:04:09.879> up

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
but uh yeah that's my ham radio set up

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.430 
but uh yeah that's my ham radio set up
got<00:04:12.040> my<00:04:12.160> 2<00:04:12.879> meter<00:04:13.090> defender<00:04:13.660> right<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:13.989> 2

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
got my 2 meter defender right there 2

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.409 
got my 2 meter defender right there 2
meter<00:04:14.650> 6<00:04:14.920> meter<00:04:15.010> which<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.849> only<00:04:16.000> use<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.299> 2

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
meter 6 meter which I only use the 2

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.340 
meter 6 meter which I only use the 2
meter<00:04:16.600> side<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.950> do<00:04:18.459> mean<00:04:18.579> Eurasia

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
meter side of it and I do mean Eurasia
