00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.910
 step addition on sirloin 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.500
 the grid 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.160
 why do you need such 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.990
 Lenin here if you need a rage shawl 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.490
 shawls fit with an external corner 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.330
 fillet net 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.200
 can make smooth edges can make 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 by steps 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.400
 step checks in my opinion looks 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.739
 more interesting then I tied 6 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.739
 double crochet + lift loops 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.510
 we have two loaf cells 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.280
 the grid 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.960
 ordinary loin column with one sc 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.469
 2 air loops 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.050
 score at the end of a row of addition 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:56.350
 and make it pretty easy that is but 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:01:03.360
 fresh 3 air loops 3 lift loops 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:05.259
 and make two columns with one single cap 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.860
 these 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:13.560
 in this chain it will be added to us 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 1 cell 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 squares in the middle i will knit 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.939
 empty so that we can see it here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:31.240
 the filled cell turned out all 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:35.049
 column above the column and then knit 2 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:41.229
 empty cells 2 usually empty cells 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:45.909
 2 air loops we enter two columns 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:50.650
 knit with one crochet and so with 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.900
 one nakida 2 air loops and again 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.270
 in a column with a sc loop here 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.159
 lifting and here we come to this edge 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.390
 how do we do the same here 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:09.579
 wand for this we will knit yet 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:15.130
 three columns but plow to chain with us 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:18.510
 no we will cling to the base 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.510
 previous column 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.300
 here also for the basis of the previous 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.360
 column 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.360
 for this here is a little eyelet that we have here 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
 formed 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.180
 we also need to link 1 column also 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.180
 cling to this loop 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:06.030
 we did a step up here 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:13.860
 again add one cell 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.860
 mean 3 air loops 3 lift loops 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.270
 two single crochets 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.520
 and the third column is already knit over the last 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.140
 a column of the previous row here again we 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.400
 made such a step increase 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.920
 next we knit an empty chair 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:56.890
 empty cells ie 2 air 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:56.890
 loop post 2 air loop post 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.450
 double crochet 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.269
 with empty cells everything is simple 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.230
 it turns out and here we reach 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:18.070
 last here knit in lift loops 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.180
 because they correspond with us 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.180
 the first pillar 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:36.330
 and here again we need to add 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:39.650
 step for this I lived at the base 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.650
 previous column 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.210
 back to the bottom of the previous column 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.659
 but this is not quite the base this one 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.659
 nakid 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.770
 here we are 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:20.320
 It turned out such a stepped edge 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.880
 if you want these corners to be 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.450
 more pronounced can be their 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:32.410
 underline here so added 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.410
 fillet mesh loops
