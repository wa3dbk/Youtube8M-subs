00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
it's mostly going to be a very light
silver<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> light<00:01:31.409> silver<00:01:31.920> color<00:01:32.130> with

silver so if you light silver color with
a<00:01:32.640> bit<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> sparkle<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.659> I'm<00:01:33.840> using<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.170> flat

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a bit of sparkle use I'm using a flat

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.370 
a bit of sparkle use I'm using a flat
eyeshadow<00:01:34.590> brush<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.840> Pat

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
eyeshadow brush so I can just really Pat

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.940 
eyeshadow brush so I can just really Pat
it<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:39.780> absorb<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.770> moisture

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it on and this will absorb the moisture

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
it on and this will absorb the moisture
from<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> pencil<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> shouldn't<00:01:42.750> crease

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
from the pencil so it shouldn't crease

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.980 
from the pencil so it shouldn't crease

I'm gonna take a little bit more of the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.850 
I'm gonna take a little bit more of the
silver<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.330> I'm<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.780> gonna<00:02:14.989> pack<00:02:15.379> it<00:02:15.409> very

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
silver and I'm just gonna pack it very

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.309 
silver and I'm just gonna pack it very
gently<00:02:17.500> underneath<00:02:18.500> my<00:02:19.040> lashes<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:21.260> is

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
gently underneath my lashes this is

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.229 
gently underneath my lashes this is
totally<00:02:21.920> optional<00:02:22.129> you<00:02:22.549> don't<00:02:22.610> have<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.120> do

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
totally optional you don't have to do

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.750 
totally optional you don't have to do
this<00:02:23.420> because<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.470> really<00:02:25.340> draws<00:02:25.610> attention

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
this because this really draws attention

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.670 
this because this really draws attention
to<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.299> silver<00:02:26.629> so<00:02:26.870> if<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:27.140> wanted<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.440> do<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
to the silver so if you wanted to do it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.190 
to the silver so if you wanted to do it
very<00:02:27.830> lightly<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:29.420> don't<00:02:29.599> have<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.019> this

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
very lightly you don't have to do this

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.220 
very lightly you don't have to do this
part<00:02:30.970> if<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.120> want<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.330> make<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.569> more<00:02:32.690> extreme

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
part if you want to make it more extreme

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.780 
part if you want to make it more extreme
I<00:02:33.440> would<00:02:33.650> suggest<00:02:33.799> putting<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.340> little<00:02:34.640> bit

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
I would suggest putting a little bit

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.420 
I would suggest putting a little bit
underneath<00:02:35.620> we<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.860> silver<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.250> there

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
underneath we have the silver on there

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.280 
underneath we have the silver on there
it's<00:02:37.610> actually<00:02:37.730> mostly<00:02:38.420> about<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.870> liquid

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
it's actually mostly about that liquid

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.319 
it's actually mostly about that liquid
liner<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.099> will<00:02:40.459> link<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:40.970> box<00:02:41.150> below

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
off and I'm gonna just trace it very

off and I'm gonna just trace it very
gently<00:03:07.540> across<00:03:09.519> all<00:03:10.519> right<00:03:10.790> by<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.150> lashes

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.740 

and<00:03:18.370> doing<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.910> very<00:03:19.210> thin<00:03:19.600> line<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.600> begin

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
and doing a very thin line just to begin

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.840 
and doing a very thin line just to begin
with<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:26.410> close<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.190> lashes<00:03:27.490> as

with it's close to the lashes as
possible<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:31.600> as<00:03:31.780> we<00:03:31.960> work<00:03:32.170> out<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.650> can

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
possible and then as we work out we can

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.740 
possible and then as we work out we can
start<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.280> get<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.460> slightly<00:03:33.910> thicker<00:03:34.390> line

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
start to get a slightly thicker line

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.480 
start to get a slightly thicker line
when<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.170> turn<00:03:35.380> my<00:03:35.410> brush<00:03:35.710> around<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.190> I'm<00:03:36.250> just

dark<00:04:42.340> because<00:04:43.240> her<00:04:43.300> hair<00:04:43.510> is<00:04:43.630> black<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.230> she

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
dark because her hair is black so she

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.690

the<00:05:02.860> root<00:05:03.190> because<00:05:03.670> obviously<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.090> don't

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
the root because obviously you don't

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.750 
the root because obviously you don't
really<00:05:04.690> want<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.900> spider<00:05:05.260> ID<00:05:05.590> or<00:05:05.860> anything<00:05:06.040> so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
just do right at the root so that

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.040 
just do right at the root so that
they're<00:05:10.450> really<00:05:10.720> really<00:05:10.930> black<00:05:12.990> obviously<00:05:13.990> if

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
they're really really black obviously if

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.270 
they're really really black obviously if
you<00:05:14.140> have<00:05:14.230> natural<00:05:14.590> back<00:05:14.740> when<00:05:14.920> do<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.100> don't

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
you have natural back when do you don't

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.990
