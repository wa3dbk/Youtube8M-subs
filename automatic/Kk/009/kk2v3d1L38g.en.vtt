gonna win this thing yeah I think that's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
gonna win this thing yeah I think that's
one<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> real<00:01:40.140> questions<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> for

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
one of the real questions here is for

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.740 
one of the real questions here is for
everybody<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.119> watched<00:01:42.420> Ryan

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
everybody out there it's watched Ryan

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
everybody out there it's watched Ryan
Villopoto<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.380> his<00:01:43.470> dominance<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> last<00:01:44.280> few

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
Villopoto and his dominance the last few

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
Villopoto and his dominance the last few
seasons<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.149> he<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.570> start<00:01:45.869> running<00:01:46.229> away

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
seasons is he gonna start running away

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.929 
seasons is he gonna start running away
because<00:01:46.590> even<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> weekends<00:01:47.280> he<00:01:47.430> hasn't<00:01:47.820> won

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
because even the weekends he hasn't won

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
because even the weekends he hasn't won
he's<00:01:48.479> been<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.020> fastest<00:01:49.439> many<00:01:49.619> times<00:01:49.829> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
he's been the fastest many times in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
he's been the fastest many times in
practice<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.430> many<00:01:50.610> times<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> fastest<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
practice and many times the fastest on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
practice and many times the fastest on
track<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.930> incidents<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.530> taken<00:01:52.829> him<00:01:52.950> out

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
track but incidents have taken him out

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
track but incidents have taken him out
is<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.939> perhaps<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.630> start<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.020> run<00:01:55.170> for

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380

lap the last one well as long as he
makes<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.240> last<00:02:48.480> lap<00:02:48.660> pass<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.200> he<00:02:49.320> has

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
makes that last lap pass like he has

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
makes that last lap pass like he has
three<00:02:49.860> out<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.190> four<00:02:50.340> winds<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.850> think<00:02:51.270> he's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
three out of the four winds I think he's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.120 
three out of the four winds I think he's
come<00:02:51.600> from<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.050> last<00:02:52.290> lap<00:02:52.620> making<00:02:53.040> those

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
come from the last lap making those

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.310 
come from the last lap making those
passes<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:53.850> he's<00:02:54.630> been<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.080> that's<00:02:55.110> been

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
passes but he's been the one that's been

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.140 
passes but he's been the one that's been
consistent<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.160> well<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.490> closely<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:57.000> mean
