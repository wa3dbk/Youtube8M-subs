00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.080
 team but still in blue 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 old team of cows was nice and easy 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.680
 recognize today because 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000

 Grab the boys go she is happy with the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 in terms of level of the team he is 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.610
 progressed 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.840
 you already have quite a cure 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.240
 around you are the van from medical to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 to power trainers and yes that is anyway 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 very nice that everything is in detail 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.229
 taken care of and that had to be with my sleeves 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 team arrange myself with tvm 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.259
 so well arranged 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 in addition, he can now with sven kramer 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.550
 still jan blokhuijsen skating benefit 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 according to coach gerard kemkers i think that 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.830
 a trio 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.869
 swim koen and jan each other to large 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.070
 heights then and that is 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.360
 good that the three of you 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.190
 for example, after a lot higher 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 level can be one 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.400
 as the new team menu says is the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.300
 there is quite a team like you 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 now drive around 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.850
 Jan then leaves on a well if you then 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.190
 not now but yes that just drives that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 it is that is high level that is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.929
 constant and learn the case well 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.580
 adjust as ideal and the ideal 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.470
 circumstances must according to Kemkes 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.130
 led to something beautiful we go the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.789
 definitely try the potential of van koen 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.399
 to get out 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.720
 we think just like it Jan kun 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.090
 once world champion all round can 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.179
 ok well then you are in that regard as well 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.500
 nice on a corpse well exactly but it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.760
 would not be good then i would 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.140
 I don't think I see it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.420
 That will be the members of the Alkmaar 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.520

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.410

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.120
 distance between the boys and girls of
