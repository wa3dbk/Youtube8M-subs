00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.940
 crispi of spices let's see the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.920
 Ingredients 400 grams of cut chicken 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 same as the first very well look that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.250
 has that is a mixture obviously with 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.980
 good texture and this is to swim 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 fried chicken but also how can we 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 organize simply here by time 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 I resorted to this product but you can 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.550
 perform in the traditional way if you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.890
 they pass a little bit for flour per egg and for 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.719
 I do not care about the friend they can place 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 the spices was going to form also 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.350
 let's say an outer cortex that is going to be 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.150
 very beautiful and I reign in the mouth 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.310
 because here we have of estamento to that 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.619
 chose addition this mixture incorporating 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.190
 as you have it in your recipe and you 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.320
 he added cumin nutmeg as no 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.659
 it can be whole that they come as two 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.490
 sticks or it can be also powder that 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.380
 you also get very easy now the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.420
 spices get them in supermarkets 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.310
 in specialty stores is no longer 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.810
 so difficult to access that we're going to 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.390
 do we have a chicken I'm going to show you 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.430
 the cut that we have is a cut like the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.259
 Lobito is a bit serious cut 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.119
 so what are we going to do, let's move on 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.850
 I'm just going to chicken 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.190
 salt already has pepper to this one 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 we incorporate a little bit of wine has 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.050
 White wine and it has already been an hour 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.880
 and a half 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.039
 obviously reposed and marinated in that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.039
 mix look what we are like we are going 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.340
 to go through the batter in this way 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.770
 if we are going to cover it completely and what 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.899
 let's do then is to take it to the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.880
 frying, we're just going to leave it 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.770
 then in high frying they are called 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.740
 when they totally discover the food 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.379
 because we want it to stay totally 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.720
 partial frying here already when it's going 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.629
 taking as golden color and what 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.390
 we can extract look at what shape as a 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:23.470
 crispin layer we can decorate it with 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:28.950
 some leaves the chicken boys should 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 remain juicy and endorse the dried chicken 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:39.040
 the spices definitely bring you 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.170
 new flavors to your recipes for many 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.620
