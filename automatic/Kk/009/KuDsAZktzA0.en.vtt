together and this is a great way to

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.660 
together and this is a great way to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
pieces wanting to go in the same

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.430 
pieces wanting to go in the same
direction<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.420> this<00:00:37.810> is<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:37.960> great<00:00:38.230> way<00:00:38.410> to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
direction and this is a great way to

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.250 
direction and this is a great way to
work<00:00:39.160> live<00:00:39.520> stitches<00:00:40.030> later<00:00:40.210> so<00:00:41.050> what<00:00:41.170> we're

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
work live stitches later so what we're

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
work live stitches later so what we're
going<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.410> do<00:00:41.590> is<00:00:41.860> start<00:00:42.190> with<00:00:42.310> a<00:00:42.370> slip<00:00:42.880> stitch

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
going to do is start with a slip stitch

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.040 
going to do is start with a slip stitch
or<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:43.960> slip<00:00:44.170> knot<00:00:44.200> on<00:00:44.800> our<00:00:45.370> needle<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.880> this<00:00:46.840> is

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
or a slip knot on our needle and this is

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.860 
or a slip knot on our needle and this is
our<00:00:47.260> working<00:00:47.500> yarn<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.160> this<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.210> my<00:00:49.420> favorite

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
our working yarn and this is my favorite

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.120 
our working yarn and this is my favorite
way<00:00:50.020> of<00:00:50.170> working<00:00:50.410> it<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:50.860> we're<00:00:50.980> going<00:00:51.070> to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
way of working it so we're going to

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.400 
way of working it so we're going to
start<00:00:51.400> off<00:00:51.610> with<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:52.060> circular<00:00:52.870> needle<00:00:53.260> and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
start off with a circular needle and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.889 
start off with a circular needle and
instead<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.100> using<00:00:54.310> waste<00:00:54.790> yarn<00:00:55.149> I<00:00:55.510> like<00:00:55.750> to

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
instead of using waste yarn I like to

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.810 
instead of using waste yarn I like to
use<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.170> circular<00:00:56.649> needle<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.130> way<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.370> have

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
use the circular needle that way I have

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.490 
use the circular needle that way I have
it<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:58.329> stitches<00:00:58.660> already<00:00:59.020> on<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.230> needle

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
it the stitches already on the needle

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.100 
it the stitches already on the needle

provisional cast on is to take what we

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.219 
provisional cast on is to take what we
call<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.799> scrap<00:02:00.310> yarn<00:02:00.579> or<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.849> waste<00:02:01.270> yarn<00:02:01.539> which

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
call a scrap yarn or a waste yarn which

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.080 
call a scrap yarn or a waste yarn which
would<00:02:02.409> be<00:02:02.529> some<00:02:02.799> different<00:02:03.459> color<00:02:03.609> than<00:02:03.909> what

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
the same weight yarn as what the product

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.140 
the same weight yarn as what the product
what<00:02:11.500> you're<00:02:11.650> actually<00:02:11.799> working<00:02:12.159> with<00:02:12.459> so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
what you're actually working with so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690 
what you're actually working with so
again<00:02:13.799> this<00:02:14.799> time<00:02:15.069> we're<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> start

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
again this time we're going to start

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.940 
again this time we're going to start
with<00:02:15.909> a<00:02:15.939> chain<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.510> I've<00:02:16.629> just

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
with a chain and I've just

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
with a chain and I've just
ten<00:02:17.310> chains<00:02:17.610> make<00:02:17.970> more<00:02:18.270> chains<00:02:18.690> than<00:02:19.020> what

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
ten chains make more chains than what

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.280 
ten chains make more chains than what
stitches<00:02:19.680> actually<00:02:20.520> are<00:02:20.670> called<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
stitches actually are called for in the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.720 
stitches actually are called for in the
pattern<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> way<00:02:22.980> you've<00:02:23.160> got<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> few

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
pattern that way you've got a few

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.210 
pattern that way you've got a few
stitches<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.989> end<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.500> each<00:02:25.709> end<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.160> you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
stitches on the end on each end so you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
stitches on the end on each end so you
can<00:02:26.310> pull<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.819> out<00:02:27.060> later<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.660> what<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> like

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
can pull this out later and what I like

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.050 
can pull this out later and what I like
to<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.129> look<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.519> this<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.849> can<00:02:30.030> see

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
to do is if you look at this you can see

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.830 
to do is if you look at this you can see
the<00:02:30.360> chains<00:02:31.730> flip<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.849> over<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.660> see

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the chains flip it over and you see

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.800 
the chains flip it over and you see
there's<00:02:34.050> bumps<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:35.220> across<00:02:35.580> here<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.269> this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
there's bumps going across here and this

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.050 
there's bumps going across here and this
is<00:02:36.959> where<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.170> place<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.220> stitches<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.880> I'll

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
is where I place the stitches so I'll

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.750 
is where I place the stitches so I'll
leave<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> few<00:02:39.660> chains<00:02:40.080> empty<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.340> way<00:02:41.519> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
leave a few chains empty that way that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.699 
leave a few chains empty that way that
gives<00:02:41.970> me<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.330> my<00:02:42.480> little<00:02:42.810> ripcord<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.680> I

and<00:04:23.790> we're<00:04:24.790> going<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:24.970> start<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.570> time<00:04:27.540> by

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
and we're going to start this time by

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.510 
and we're going to start this time by
doing<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.870> slip<00:04:29.140> knot<00:04:29.169> with<00:04:29.590> both<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:30.010> them<00:04:30.160> held

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
doing a slip knot with both of them held

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.380 
doing a slip knot with both of them held
together<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.290> make<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.440> slip<00:04:33.180> slide<00:04:34.180> that

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
together so you make a slip slide that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.409 
together so you make a slip slide that
on<00:04:34.540> there<00:04:34.780> keep<00:04:35.530> your<00:04:35.770> working<00:04:36.460> yarn<00:04:36.910> so<00:04:37.300> the

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
on there keep your working yarn so the

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.760 
on there keep your working yarn so the
yarn<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.840> you're<00:04:38.050> actually<00:04:38.260> using<00:04:38.440> in<00:04:38.740> your

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
yarn that you're actually using in your

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.280 
yarn that you're actually using in your
project<00:04:39.310> will<00:04:39.550> be<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.760> top<00:04:40.000> yarn<00:04:40.300> your<00:04:40.990> waste

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
project will be the top yarn your waste

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.560 
project will be the top yarn your waste
yarn<00:04:41.470> will<00:04:42.010> be<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.310> bottom<00:04:42.490> yarn<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.150> you're

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
yarn will be the bottom yarn and you're

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.790 
yarn will be the bottom yarn and you're
going<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.810> hold<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.200> like<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.380> would<00:04:44.680> if

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
going to hold it like you would if

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.830 
going to hold it like you would if
you're<00:04:44.890> doing<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.220> long<00:04:45.400> tail<00:04:45.669> cast<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.270> you're

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
you're doing a long tail cast on you're

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.590 
you're doing a long tail cast on you're
going<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.229> come<00:04:47.410> over<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.800> top<00:04:48.600> underneath

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
going to come over the top underneath

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.170 
going to come over the top underneath
around<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.860> wrap<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:51.190> it's<00:04:51.490> just<00:04:51.760> like<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.060> was

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
around and wrap it it's just like I was

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.760 
around and wrap it it's just like I was
showing<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.510> how<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:53.050> when<00:04:53.169> we<00:04:53.290> did<00:04:53.500> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
showing you how to do it when we did the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.580 
showing you how to do it when we did the
adding<00:04:54.610> for<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.450> circular<00:04:55.870> needle<00:04:56.169> it's<00:04:56.380> the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
adding for the circular needle it's the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.490 
adding for the circular needle it's the
same<00:04:56.950> motion<00:04:57.880> so<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.419> can<00:04:58.750> either<00:04:58.900> use<00:04:59.020> this

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
same motion so you can either use this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.750 
same motion so you can either use this
method<00:05:00.010> or<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:01.470> circular<00:05:02.470> needle<00:05:02.800> which

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
method or the the circular needle which

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.159 
method or the the circular needle which
is<00:05:03.910> what<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.150> like<00:05:04.450> because<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.780> way<00:05:05.050> the

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
is what I like because that way the

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.650 
is what I like because that way the
needles<00:05:05.500> are<00:05:05.590> already<00:05:05.979> there<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.600> don't

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
needles are already there and I don't

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.450 
needles are already there and I don't
have<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:08.050> worry<00:05:08.200> about<00:05:08.350> pulling<00:05:08.710> this<00:05:09.040> out<00:05:09.250> in

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
have to worry about pulling this out in

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.570 
have to worry about pulling this out in
the<00:05:09.550> end<00:05:10.080> see<00:05:11.080> how<00:05:11.200> we're<00:05:11.380> doing<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:13.200> over

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
the end see how we're doing this over

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.750 
the end see how we're doing this over
under<00:05:15.580> up<00:05:15.850> through<00:05:16.630> over<00:05:17.410> around<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:18.250> what

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
under up through over around and what

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.480 
under up through over around and what
it's<00:05:18.880> doing<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.539> its<00:05:20.020> twisting<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:21.669> see

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
it's doing is its twisting and you see

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.670 
it's doing is its twisting and you see
you're<00:05:22.789> scrap<00:05:23.120> yarn<00:05:23.419> there<00:05:23.720> when<00:05:24.350> you<00:05:24.500> get

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
you're scrap yarn there when you get

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.279 
you're scrap yarn there when you get
your<00:05:24.889> knitted<00:05:25.160> piece<00:05:25.370> completed<00:05:26.289> these

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
your knitted piece completed these

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.409 
your knitted piece completed these
little<00:05:28.009> loops<00:05:28.280> here<00:05:28.610> when<00:05:28.729> you<00:05:28.850> pull<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:29.210> out

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
little loops here when you pull this out

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.969 
little loops here when you pull this out
they'll<00:05:29.690> make<00:05:29.900> little<00:05:30.199> loops<00:05:30.380> like<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.770> did<00:05:30.949> on

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
they'll make little loops like it did on

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.650 
they'll make little loops like it did on
the<00:05:31.099> other<00:05:31.370> piece<00:05:31.699> and<00:05:31.910> that's<00:05:32.330> where<00:05:32.599> you

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
the other piece and that's where you

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.150 
the other piece and that's where you
insert<00:05:32.930> your<00:05:33.110> needle<00:05:33.229> that's<00:05:33.770> all<00:05:33.919> there<00:05:34.069> is

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
insert your needle that's all there is

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.210 
insert your needle that's all there is
