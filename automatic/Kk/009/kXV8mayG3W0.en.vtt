00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
speed for four or five minutes you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
speed for four or five minutes you
mixture<00:01:09.390> hang<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.600> together<00:01:09.899> so<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.440> start

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
mixture hang on together so they start

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
mixture hang on together so they start
to<00:01:10.770> down<00:01:10.979> together<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.789> put<00:01:11.940> your<00:01:11.970> hand

in there now what's happening is stick
everywhere<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.190> then<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.940> stickiness<00:01:15.390> may

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
everywhere and then the stickiness may

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
everywhere and then the stickiness may
your<00:01:16.229> brain<00:01:16.410> feel<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.039> sticky<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.580> put
