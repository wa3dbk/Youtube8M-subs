00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
first game was a dud but I think that's

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.660 
first game was a dud but I think that's
because<00:01:14.229> we<00:01:14.740> were<00:01:14.830> first<00:01:15.040> infected<00:01:15.430> which

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
because we were first infected which

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.430 
because we were first infected which
makes<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:15.970> fucking<00:01:16.450> impossible<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:17.110> get<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.260> DNA

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
makes it fucking impossible to get a DNA

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.930 
makes it fucking impossible to get a DNA
bomb<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:17.979> on<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.130> bright<00:01:18.250> side<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.580> got<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.700> spy
