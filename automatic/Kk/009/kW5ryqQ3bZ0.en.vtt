00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.180
 my name is Michael and today we are with you 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.500
 touch on quite important parts 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.190
 kit any go appliances 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.080
 this is a watch not so long ago I came across 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.480
 such a problem I broke my 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.519
 previous kassio who loved very much 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.230
 it took me another watch 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.630
 broke down and not primarily because 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.579
 they were not such a brutal 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.180
 of the kind they were ordinary watches in steel 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.610
 I rubbed the body and pobilis 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.699
 I stopped working here and in general 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.719
 I decided to buy others, but since I donâ€™t 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.910
 there was 150 200 dollars to buy 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.850
 rather expensive G Series shock or else 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.109
 from 50 I drew my attention to 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.780
 watch market somewhere around 20 to 50 dollars 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:01:00.079
 This brand actually found the money 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.910
 youtube brand alone is enough 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.960
 little known in our country 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.900
 here 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.340
 but I was encouraged by the fact that this is a brand 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.370
 is part of a large corporation 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.110
 synthesis is what actually spodviglo 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.750
 buy me since I guessed about 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.980
 that clock we will probably be worth 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.670
 their money as it turned out actually 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 talking about x 39 hours is understandable and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.710
 recognizable design series g shock 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.830
 with some of its features here 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.080
 speaking of directly applied 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.270
 The materials in this watch are sufficient 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.770
 nice plastic 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.170
 Here is such a very nice 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.420
 textured it does not glare too 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.090
 useful enough here he does not creak all 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.820
 very neatly there is no such thing 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.220
 there are no problems with the hull anywhere 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.630
 castings from any parts or else 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.980
 everything is done quite neatly 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.990
 that he still really like in this watch 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.780
 that there are very large side buttons 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.580
 that this watch is driven 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.130
 big plus when you use with 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.750
 for hours somewhere in the dark and either 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.840
 constrained circumstances you never 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.050
 miss besides this watch they still 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.100
 all their actions with them they 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.620
 It gives such a big sound too 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.510
 plus as for me you can always understand it 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.740
 pressed the button and above, sting or not 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.410
 pressed it plus talking talking about 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 some characteristic of the senses 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.610
 it is useless where it stands 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.470
 the same absolutely Japanese mechanism 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 miyo as it stands and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.750
 in the same g-shock they are absolutely the same 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.270
 time from from so in general here 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.770
 feature set standard this is a stopwatch 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.700
 alarm clock 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.220
 two time zones and in general, all is well 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.840
 Naturally backlight which is remarkable 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.970
 backlight can start with two 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.880
 buttons this is this button which 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.740
 actually labeled light and this one 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.580
 I liked the button very much too 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.630
 because it is very comfortable you do not need to reach 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.950
 backlight or not here it is such 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.130
 blue-green camera a little bit wrong 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.800
 it reflects light but not the essence except 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.820
 other things, the manufacturer claims 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.280
 water resistant up to one hundred 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:24.300
 meters what actually shows 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.300
 the inscription on the back of the watch will show 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.560
 that's 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.980
 well let's say honestly I will not climb 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.959
 such depths I have the wrong faith 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.450
 special equipment but it says 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.280
 that the clock will hold some 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.130
 standard type test hand washing 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.230
 either rinsing in water or even higher 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.209
 some kind of swim 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.830
 waters that actually to me, in general, and 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:55.630
 need to check them later very interesting 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.440
 way but actually the very essence 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:03.130
 Shopping was what I did not end 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.930
 believed that this watch could be good 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.130
 an excellent alternative to the same g-shock 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.770
 here but I have had their demands their 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.450
 some views on watches which watches 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.580
 fully justified because 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.020
 not big dial not 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.540
 fits me well on hand 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.920
 they look good on hand bad 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.900
 buttons as I mentioned 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.970
 they have backlighting and they have enough 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.370
 powerful body meaning it is good 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.920
 plastic and i already have some experience 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.920
 using the theme for about a month 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.890
 they showed themselves good enough 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.210
 boredom i teach so that lover cling 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.920
 for all sorts of things for hours what actually 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.020
 adversely affect them but as you can see 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.700
 there is almost no trace left 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.080
 may be further but not yet 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.250
 yourself well shown about 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.810
 directly strap is very important 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.650
 part of the clock because if it is not 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.010
 comfortable there will be the sock of this watch 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.810
 turn in from strap happen people 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.250
 that he is rubber but I have little in it 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.530
 It is believed since the clock is first 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.720
 budget but no matter what 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.000
 discomfort or irritation 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.140
 this strap does not leave you 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.100
 business is good enough 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.770
 Clasp as you can see quite massive 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.710
 Here she is such a well, in general, it is clear 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.110
 allow design and in general well 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.790
 taken over by the clock all is well by the way here 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.830
 this one here is a compass view upgrade 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:33.000
 I personally dealt with such parts which 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.000
 additionally dressed for this watch 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.120
 so they will look like them 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.400
 arrived actually well now try 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.250
 do let a lot of experience out of time on 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.180
 watch here and we will try this watch 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.520
 dip the water itself imitating the usual 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.400
 use of which 500 from sailing either 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.810
 same washing for 10 minutes for 15 let's see 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.880
 what happens to them then 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.530
 by the end of the time allotted to us for hours here 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.170
 the clock itself floats in a jug 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.630
 here and before I take them out 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.750
 explained why I boldly jugger at all 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.580
 and for what did it do it more often 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.070
 all of us few face 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.360
 tasks like immersion and either 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:21.160
 underwater hunting or something else 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.790
 I did not intend to lower them to the bottom 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.150
 sea 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.640
 either something similar but more often we 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.940
 Watch moisten some or the hand washing 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.390
 or washing the car came under the rain and 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.070
 either bathed somewhere in the pond or 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.170
 the same fishing too 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.510
 short on constant contact 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.340
 with water at absolutely shallow depths 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.680
 which pressure does not affect absolutely 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:54.400
 or not so much at atmospheric pressure 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:57.360
 actually about dragging the clock well 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.990
 that we actually have our watch 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:06.280
 but that's only from the pitcher on the well 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:12.460
 classes of buttons as you can see 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:14.230
 works great here and in general the fact that 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.510
 and required to prove their tasks 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:20.169
 Can not cope properly 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:23.590
 go to the results for me to buy 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:25.450
 protrek watch series shock either 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.080
 absolutely not because i'm not so 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.840
 hardcore user to dive with them 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.419
 runs beat how then surely the differences 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.610
 there are between the hours they are due to the price and 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:38.919
 do not forget about the fact that the difference between these 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.960
 first of all they are associated with the brand in 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.880
 steve products are therefore most often 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.020
 buying a little known product we don't 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.300
 overpaying for marriage is important and 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.040
 therefore, it is these watches they perform 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.160
 completely all assigned to them 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.390
 requirements they have a good body 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.830
 water proof good indication 

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:03.870
 small and durable case and that's all that 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.400
 could get for their day 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.419
 specific model I will write in the description 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.370
 under the video 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:11.710
 This is actually all a big thank you.
