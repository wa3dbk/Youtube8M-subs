show Alex on the field I think the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.440 
show Alex on the field I think the

course is a fundamental I think the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.740 
course is a fundamental I think the
courses<00:01:10.700> hopefully<00:01:11.700> people<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:12.270> away<00:01:12.390> from

afterwards and you're probably gonna

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.020 
afterwards and you're probably gonna
learn<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:28.979> when<00:01:29.430> you're<00:01:29.549> working<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:29.970> the

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
in time to develop a a more creative

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.410 
in time to develop a a more creative
English<00:02:46.590> player<00:02:46.799> 100%<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.269> there's<00:02:48.390> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
English player 100% I think there's a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.030 
English player 100% I think there's a
lot<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.930> talk<00:02:49.109> about<00:02:49.230> creative<00:02:49.950> English

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
lot of talk about creative English

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.530 
lot of talk about creative English
players<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:50.879> we've<00:02:51.000> got<00:02:51.150> creative

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
players I think we've got creative

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.990 
players I think we've got creative
English<00:02:51.629> players<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
English players but I think it's a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.460 
English players but I think it's a
longer-term<00:02:54.359> project<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.049> me

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
longer-term project for me

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.199 
longer-term project for me
I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:56.099> there's<00:02:56.430> been<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.730> always<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> lot<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
I think there's been as always a lot of

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.089 
I think there's been as always a lot of
knee-jerk<00:02:57.389> reactions<00:02:58.049> that's<00:02:58.799> just<00:02:58.980> my

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
knee-jerk reactions that's just my

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.839 
knee-jerk reactions that's just my
opinion

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
opinion

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.970 
opinion
and<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.319> need<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.590> set<00:03:01.829> ourselves

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and I think we need to set ourselves

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.430 
and I think we need to set ourselves
into<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.909> into<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> long-term<00:03:03.840> model<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.319> when

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
into and into a long-term model so when

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.539 
into and into a long-term model so when
you're<00:03:04.530> talking<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.859> player<00:03:05.040> development<00:03:05.370> for

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
you're talking to player development for

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.819 
you're talking to player development for
5<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.879> 21<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:06.810> we're<00:03:07.049> doing<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.409> this<00:03:07.530> course

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
5 to 21 as we're doing on this course

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.349 
5 to 21 as we're doing on this course
that's<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.700> long<00:03:08.849> term<00:03:08.879> we're<00:03:09.269> also

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
that's the long term we're also

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.119 
that's the long term we're also
developing<00:03:09.629> players<00:03:10.109> at<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.349> age<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.620> 5<00:03:10.889> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
healthier when we finish then than when

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.449 
healthier when we finish then than when

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
think that's a big thing that the FA

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.059 
think that's a big thing that the FA
have<00:03:38.970> got<00:03:39.150> into<00:03:39.500> not<00:03:40.500> only<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:40.859> they<00:03:40.949> got

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
have got into not only if they got

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.449 
have got into not only if they got
