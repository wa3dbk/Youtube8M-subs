first playthrough I tried to go through
them<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.340> fast<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.119> them<00:00:30.269> under<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
them a little fast to get them under the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.260 
them a little fast to get them under the
10<00:00:30.720> minute<00:00:31.019> time<00:00:31.199> limit<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.130> too<00:00:32.369> there's

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
a few videos I gotta split up into two

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.360 
a few videos I gotta split up into two
but<00:00:36.200> other<00:00:37.200> than<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> they're<00:00:38.040> pretty<00:00:38.309> much

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but other than that they're pretty much

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
but other than that they're pretty much
all<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.540> video<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> yeah<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
all in just one video so yeah you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.619 
all in just one video so yeah you
definitely<00:00:41.760> gonna<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.270> take<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
definitely gonna want to take it a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
definitely gonna want to take it a
little<00:00:42.780> slower<00:00:43.140> maybe<00:00:44.329> depending<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.420> what

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
little slower maybe depending on what

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.170 
little slower maybe depending on what
whatever<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> feel<00:00:46.410> comfortable<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.180> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
whatever you feel comfortable with the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
whatever you feel comfortable with the
mostly<00:00:48.539> strategies<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.379> show<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:50.610> work

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
mostly strategies I show you they work

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.529 
mostly strategies I show you they work
every<00:00:51.239> time<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:52.110> most<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:53.030> not<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.090> time

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
every time but most of them not all time

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.139 
every time but most of them not all time
sometimes<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.280> obviously<00:00:56.489> things<00:00:57.000> are

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
sometimes you know obviously things are

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.830 
sometimes you know obviously things are
a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.360> different<00:00:59.180> yeah<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.480> take<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
a little different yeah so just take it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
a little different yeah so just take it
slow<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.190> tip<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:03.000> go

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
slow that's my first tip just don't go

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
slow that's my first tip just don't go
get<00:01:03.329> too<00:01:03.480> frustrated<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.350> you'll

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
get too frustrated because you'll

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.750 
get too frustrated because you'll
eventually<00:01:04.739> get<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.580> really<00:01:08.580> not

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
eventually get it it's really really not

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.580 
eventually get it it's really really not
too<00:01:09.119> hard<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.720> mean<00:01:09.900> after<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.439> what

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
too hard I mean after you know what

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
too hard I mean after you know what
you're<00:01:10.710> doing<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.490> might<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.119> my

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you're doing this might this was my

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're doing this might this was my
fourth<00:01:12.570> playthrough<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:14.220> seemed<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
fourth playthrough and it seemed like it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.590 
fourth playthrough and it seemed like it
was<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.130> lot<00:01:17.130> easier<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:17.939> first<00:01:18.150> time<00:01:18.420> on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
was a lot easier than my first time on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
was a lot easier than my first time on
veteran<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> my<00:01:20.549> second<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:20.939> on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
veteran this is my second time on

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.860 
veteran this is my second time on
veteran

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
veteran

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.930 
veteran
but<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.800> seemed<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.130> lot<00:01:23.340> easier<00:01:23.550> than<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
but it seemed a lot easier than the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.330 
but it seemed a lot easier than the
first<00:01:24.090> time<00:01:25.820> anyway<00:01:26.820> quit<00:01:27.420> number<00:01:27.660> two<00:01:28.340> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
first time anyway quit number two you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.710 
first time anyway quit number two you
might<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.730> into<00:01:29.940> every<00:01:30.270> checkpoint

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
might want to go into every checkpoint

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.110 
might want to go into every checkpoint
with<00:01:31.470> hundred<00:01:31.980> percent<00:01:32.220> health<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.760> very

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
with hundred percent health or very

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.280 
with hundred percent health or very
close<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.480> understand<00:01:34.140> how<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:36.000> will<00:01:36.510> help<00:01:37.020> out

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
close to understand how it will help out

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.490 
close to understand how it will help out
a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:38.210> or<00:01:39.380> later<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:41.250> mission<00:01:42.260> if<00:01:43.260> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
a lot or later on in the mission if you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.280 
a lot or later on in the mission if you
don't<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.130> upset<00:01:44.400> house<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:46.170> know

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
don't have an upset house and you know

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
don't have an upset house and you know
checkpoints<00:01:46.860> coming<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.370> might<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
checkpoints coming up you might just

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.570 
checkpoints coming up you might just
want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.940> die<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:49.100> obviously<00:01:50.100> you'll<00:01:50.430> get

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
want to die and obviously you'll get

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.130 
want to die and obviously you'll get
your<00:01:50.730> health<00:01:50.940> back<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.480> then<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.900> try<00:01:52.080> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

worry<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.450> running<00:02:03.690> out<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.900> ammo<00:02:04.490> most<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
worry about running out of ammo most the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.690 
worry about running out of ammo most the
time<00:02:05.850> because<00:02:06.780> most<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.100> enemies<00:02:08.250> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
time because most all the enemies on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.750 
time because most all the enemies on
every<00:02:08.730> level<00:02:09.890> use<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.160> mp40<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:13.760> that's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
