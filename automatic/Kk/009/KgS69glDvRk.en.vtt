00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.030
 cap-ex gives film series on every topic 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.889
 everything about gaming comics 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.089
 but there is such a prominent one 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.610
 franchise that until now only with 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.020
 absence gleamed and that's harry 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.820
 Potter and now must necessarily 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.180
 let's change that's why there are now 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.520
 with us two snacks once from 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.380
 gryffindor and also from semmering and 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.690
 because you always just totally in 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.070
 focus are follow who will make 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.219
 you do not have that , you have him 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.469
 example, the swimmer broken 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.539
 So ewering step back is the principle 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.239
 The built-up as every netbooks has for 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.100
 at the front the sewn straight sign 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.710
 of course the adjustable rear 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.149
 pressure button bar and therefore the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.530
 own head to adapt a bit there 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.629
 come right over the topic size 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.089
 speak because that is at a snap now 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.280
 put it like that so you want as 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.420
 fit hold yes so with small 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.800
 children must have a look and 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.050
 if you are now in a very big head 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.999
 In 90 percent of the cases I would say 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.620
 In 98 percent of the cases , it just fits 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.390
 with the possibilities you have here 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.590
 and now if you just bite through child 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.870
 just should be good times 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.030
 because you should now her 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.650
 Do not pretend that you should 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.400
 So more than predetermined if I so 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.320
 go here 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.700
 and let that survive and that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.840
 then cling so tight 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.830
 then mister form comic 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.930
 behavior simply is not him 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.150
 reasonable from what should you say so 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.430
 to limit oneself to these possibilities 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.750
 then it looks reasonable too 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.760
 highlight every snack is natural 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.050
 front the imprint resp 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.360
 You can press but that is 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.760
 embroidered and that's it slammerin 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.050
 button anyway a 3d capable stich 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.880
 really beautiful before very nice 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.770
 worked and in the background stops 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.280
 Again severin for all who have it 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.720
 do not know 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.160
 there it is very clear I think so 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 beautifully designed and fits naturally 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.260
 also this green to the something darker 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.780
 gray shade I'd say great for griffin 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.950
 very short the comparison is it is yes 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.290
 the red as befits for 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.700
 Gryffindor but the fabric is behind 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.460
 clearly brighter it just fits 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.430
 Better also red but we were her 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.100
 rather stay in the fabric behind the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.480
 it is a bit thinner than than 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.860
 different network that is now one 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.420
 a little matter of taste I would 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.739
 claim it wears more comfortable there 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.720
 is maybe very much in the summer 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.400
 but is nice in the end a matter of taste 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.370
 if you have that a little bit thicker 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.590
 wants or does not want pretty 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.690
 also on the other side of the cap 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.459
 in the front is also harry potter 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.569
 Personally, I am very impressed 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.220
 beautiful 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.930
 and where we are at the moment 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.250
 optional or additional embroidery 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.420
 are a thing not mentioned yet 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.069
 here at the side we still have 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 a snake that fits naturally 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.489
 Severin is almost symbolic of that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.780
 house because the gryphon gold cup is 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.620
 of course, no snakes because they have 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.140
 taken another animal of course 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.879
 the obligatory lion like that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.650
 That's exactly what we have 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.510
 all said what you say use this 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.310
 Now you just have to go for one 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.560
 I decide to take each one better 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.540
 fits my t-shirt and so on 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.799
 still the question so that's almost 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.930
 already comes a bit out of the hip 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.670
 hop area of ​​this network sees why 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.379
 one in hobart I say no bright or 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.379
 any other subcultures 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.920
 Bern 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:20.290
 echo age where are your hobbies ins 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.010
 Life 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.010
 no, what a stupid thing
