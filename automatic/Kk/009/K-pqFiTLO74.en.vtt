00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.550
 Hello dear friends with you loki and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.150
 we have another opening packs packs with 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.100
 limited time packs of 25 thousand 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.239
 ten as long as we have let's begin and 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.050
 let's see what we can fall today 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.560
 now the best players there are david louis all 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.850
 who differed the next matches and so 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:54.290
 we plaster falls but we have it 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.290
 small in my opinion it costs nothing to 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 Adebayor did he, too, bullshit you still 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.289
 up to 750 shorter and yes he slept too 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 worthless so quick sale 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:23.900
 all the next pack try on fast 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.520
 skip and we again 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:36.890
 Baptista Danila and May I May the Country 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.890
 look about 10 10 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:51.330
 8 800 let's give for 9 500 can 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.920
 be someone he rarely come in handy 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.910
 now generally someone buys something on 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.330
 transfer because really 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.390
 players drop out a lot now 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.380
 packs actively buy coins 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.300
 and basically there are many players who 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.750
 used to be expensive now very much fall 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.340
 in price 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:25.920
 a story 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:30.209
 it's all duplicates here you have three juice 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.860
 you stand at such a speed of 1000 to bring out 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.340
 the company is not such a little known 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:45.360
 players they are rarely anybody here 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.790
 I gave up playing guys on the show 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 gamepad from xbox because a bunch of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.390
 questions goes on what do you play comran on 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:03.030
 iz and if we look at number well in my opinion he 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:09.660
 also worth nothing 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:17.790
 xl then who else here we have alba in my 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:21.080
 also 1150 inform as if a hundred years 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.410
 buy even if you put a thousand 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.700
 okay quick sale 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:32.320
 see friends 3 yet 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.850
 4 while six are left try not 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:46.630
 skip try so look 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:49.200
 maybe something so yes to the club that u 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.200
 us yet 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.020
 Well, most likely you are even with such 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.020
 speed to no one gave up 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.300
 it will be necessary to buy too coins too 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.460
 ask about fifa 15 i did 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.700
 pre-order have not done yet yes because I 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.880
 especially not rush because it makes sense 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:25.770
 Now do pre-order if somewhere else 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:31.060
 about there 80 days before the release 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.760
 I will also do nothing to two people at the end 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.720
 summer can be there in september because 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.910
 that nothing really changes and the main thing 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.190
 it's time to pre-order u get 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.190
 bonuses so 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.610
 sense to do now and sit and type i 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:59.090
 spent money i have pre-order 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:00.790
 but I donâ€™t know it very well 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.550
 get it off 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.800
 leave you too in the club fernando 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.680
 torres sales list you have at least 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:24.080
 something full is worth nothing yes he 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:28.090
 cheap 3000 more well I have this feeling 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.490
 what for example of us these 10 packs the sum 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:36.320
 somewhere probably 2 pack of exactly 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:45.230
 recaptured sales well a little less there 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:52.370
 maybe one and the 75th fell to the sword but we 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:58.400
 also a duplicate and most likely he is also not 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:06:07.400
 the devil is not worth but who else is there with us 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:09.850
 Denisov and dos Santos lately 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.340
 friends in these banks are serious 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:16.280
 one shit falls me personally 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:22.270
 Yes, I often fell in ordinary packs 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.270
 gold for 7 500 match players hit 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.370
 But in these by how I bought 50 thousand 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:33.280
 there were packs of mine for a hundred thousand there were two 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.780
 while I bought and there really are some 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.810
 duplicates when i bought two so far by 100 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.510
 Thousands of I had 24 subjects 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.020
 I think there were only 22 duplicates 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:50.400
 bed in each of these ben harp yes 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:56.250
 too, no one wants to be like 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:07:00.960
 and it's generally ok you buy a pack 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.300
 for 100000 and those drops out 22 duplicate from 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.430
 twenty four possible barely of oil 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:10.139
 the nonsense there is some kind of us 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:14.240
 last pack and I think everything will be here 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.240
 as bad as in the past 9 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:25.590
 drum roll and yes how you see neither 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:32.160
 one player match to us did not fall out 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:33.750
 juba honestly and having gone form spots but also 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.910
 I hope you liked gray friends 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.680

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.960
