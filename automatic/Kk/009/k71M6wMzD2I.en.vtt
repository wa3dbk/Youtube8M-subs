00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.860
 dries the air that mimics the texture of the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.870
 cream is equally light and applies 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.510
 equally with the pastry bag that 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.699
 it also includes liquid but this is coming 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.440
 white paste to get the 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.350
 pink color we want for our 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.480
 we mix it previously with 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.259
 any type of paint in this case 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.720
 is the pink oil painting of 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.350
 lamarque tita but it can be any 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.570
 acrylic paint or watercolors what 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 have at home then to dye the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.240
 pasta before with a little bit of pasta 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.039
 amount you want to mix is ​​in a 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.530
 plastic cup with a little paint 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.140
 pre move well 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.260
 and assemble in a pastry bag to 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.860
 apply like this we need to protect the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.840
 surface where we are going to write with 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.930
 transparent anointing of normal kitchen 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.390
 for those then I have this table that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.250
 is covered with the transparent film and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.320
 here I will write then in this case 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.009
 I'm going to write my name but it can be 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.009
 anything 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.069
 then I'm applying little by little 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.069
 squeezing 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.060
 pretty strong 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.840
 and I write very slowly 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.090
 and you can write 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.310
 what he wants is 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:37.190
 Now we have to wait about 24 hours 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.770
 or better for it to dry completely 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.740
 careful because it is humid we have to 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.740
 wait 24 hours before removing the 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.810
 plastic after waiting a day already 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.810
 we can detach it from the transparent film 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.840
 As you can see, it takes off super easy and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.840
 totally dry 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.080
 make sure it is well dried by both 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.660
 sides 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.960
 and now we 're going to decorate it with the syrup 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.960
 of chocolate 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.990
 to give the effect of chocolate drops 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.440
 that fall for this I use the syrup of 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.440
 chocolate color 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.099
 and I'm applying it 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.430
 directly drawing with one's own 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.349
 tip drawing the drops as if they were 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.290
 the chocolate drops we have to 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.720
 also wait about 24 hours for 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.760
 dry completely before mounting it as 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.150
 a necklace before mounting it as a 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.280
 necklace we have to make sure that the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.920
 the pastas that we have used are 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.439
 completely dry those that mimic the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.680
 molten chocolate those that imitate the cream 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.909
 of 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.400
 pink everything and now when it's 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.609
 completely dry we can mount it 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.960
 we take a jewelery hook is more 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.480
 comfortable to catch it with 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.760
 pliers 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.079
 we apply a little bit of 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:23.340
 strong glue of any type 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.340
 and we put it directly in the letter 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.330
 where we want 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.859
 the sky 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:35.949
 we have to wait a little bit 

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:38.379
 a few minutes it is completely dry 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.039
 glue and we can assemble it with the 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.039
 chain 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.460
 for this there will be a hook 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.460
 the method of the hips 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.389
 we close on the hook the same thing we repeat 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.169
 on the other side we already have our 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.669
 necklace mounted remember that they are pasta 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.880
 that are air- dried and are resistant 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.880
 to water, so if it gets dirty it can be 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.270
 wash perfectly with a little soap 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.400
 and water and will be like new always with 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.250
 the stars that we have done before 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.670
 we can mount some earrings for this 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.670
 we apply a little bit of 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.670
 strong glue on the back 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.900
 and we give you the base for the earrings 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.870
 nothing 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.180
 so we already have our earrings 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.639
