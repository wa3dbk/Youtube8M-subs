 so how to make money with this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 race which is a total down but 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.549
 if we do it's having a maximum of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 players so the goal is to fill the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.460
 goals yesterday but it's done you have this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.430
 same thing but only really it will be worth 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.869
 not work so if you're going to do 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.640
 invite people but not just anyone 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.140
 the moves the goal is to invite people 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.229
 from the raw forces and join them blow 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.490
 to Saturday production and as you know 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.170
 that he wants to join the group 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 you live invite you to invite you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.590
 his will be plenty of locals who go 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.180
 to join you and also invite you 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 friends because apparently when one 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.400
 invite local people and friends and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 bonuses 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.740
 choosing the bonus is 15% by 5907 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.500
 actions of your neck he says and 15% be 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.579
 to consider this 10% end for me the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 description here by have not the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.509
 exact percentage one creates a percentage 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 more attacks friends and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.320
 local people so that's what light up 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.159
 is to join the group is healthy 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.729
 sieved dg of the nut and 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.630
 for evenman more bonuses 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.520
 world race even if it's not the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 blow anyhow not bad you 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.360
 just have to have a lot of people in 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.040
 the race on six to eight people and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.170
 put a maximum of turns possible 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.910
 do not put 40 years are serious and the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.470
 to tire of getting tired once you're ok 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.720
 pay the costs but I would rather say 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.519
 to be told where they will start 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.390
 many times because also mostly 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.870
 the first earn the most money 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.160
 not the last ones even if you put 40 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.569
 turns the dany he'll leave it's clear 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.670
 that they had won it's going to fetch 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.890
 Africa one turn for nothing and that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.379
 takes a maximum of time you submit 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.489
 what says aloud 5 rounds is a party 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.079
 many times it's really going to our 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.430
 study it's true that it can not be learned 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.720
 many you chose goes on to ten rounds 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.099
 While it pays anyway 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.920
 not bad so we are a bit like 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.620
 earn about 50 miles on over broken 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.780
 touches 3 to 8 people do not have 15 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.129
 a thousand and fifty thousand that breaks everything so 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.379
 it crushes tourÃ© access that people 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.840
 knowing that the trick is done in just 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.920
 two minutes do not like me so that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.239
 depends on driving is a powerful jet 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.200
 ski so it's really they make 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.220
 to do this race which I hope in 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.290
 all kinds the group to be able 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.639
 participate in this activity up 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.750
 and here is also invites you to share the 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.870
 video for as many people as possible 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.950
 can take advantage of this trick that me 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.769
 will make a maximum of money 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.049
 very easily without service tomorrow the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.549
 boars not in selling cars nor 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.160
 nothing and then like that even if you are 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.750
 poor did not make any money base for 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.459
 sell mega expensive cars you have 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.049
 just other than that it's very simple and it 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.220
 could make a good money base 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.220
 to buy an apartment 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.299
 the shutters too that's cap see my 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.829
 Youtube channel 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.730
 if you liked it and share it with a 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.349
 accident because he is sure that 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.480
