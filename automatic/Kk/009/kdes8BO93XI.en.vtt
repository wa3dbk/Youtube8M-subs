delete some of the indexes out of it so
we<00:03:38.739> will<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.190> picking<00:03:39.730> up<00:03:39.880> this<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:42.060> starter

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
we will be picking up this and starter

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.500 
we will be picking up this and starter
home<00:03:43.329> basic<00:03:44.069> we<00:03:45.069> have<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.340> remove<00:03:45.579> out<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.910> it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.600 

so<00:03:50.110> once<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.590> deleted<00:03:50.860> all<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.340> indexes

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
so once we have deleted all the indexes

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.270 
so once we have deleted all the indexes
let<00:03:52.269> us<00:03:52.360> see<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.810> information<00:03:53.349> again<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.159> we

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
let us see the information again so we

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.339 
let us see the information again so we
have<00:03:54.430> professional<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.540> ultimate<00:03:55.959> available

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.610 
have professional and ultimate available
here<00:04:00.060> now<00:04:01.060> we<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.480> import<00:04:01.780> indexes<00:04:02.500> from

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
here now we have to import indexes from

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.900 
here now we have to import indexes from
64-bit<00:04:04.230> image<00:04:05.230> for<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.459> will<00:04:06.640> be<00:04:06.790> using

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
64-bit image for that we will be using

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.270
