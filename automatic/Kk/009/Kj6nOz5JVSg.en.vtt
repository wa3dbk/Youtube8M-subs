worked on that how to make a monster
stood<00:01:10.810> out<00:01:10.930> because<00:01:11.439> of<00:01:11.770> its<00:01:11.979> qualities

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
stood out because of its qualities

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.160 
stood out because of its qualities
because<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.090> embraces<00:01:13.299> both<00:01:13.720> science

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
because it embraces both science

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.859 
because it embraces both science
technology<00:01:14.830> engineering<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.790> art<00:01:16.420> as<00:01:16.630> well

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
technology engineering and art as well

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.050 
technology engineering and art as well
it<00:01:17.020> fuses<00:01:17.530> all<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.860> these<00:01:17.979> together<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.909> way

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
it fuses all of these together in a way

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.730 
it fuses all of these together in a way
that<00:01:19.270> is<00:01:19.390> very<00:01:19.450> complementary<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.530> types

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
that is very complementary to the types

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.289 
that is very complementary to the types
of<00:01:20.890> things<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.189> we<00:01:21.250> do<00:01:21.369> here<00:01:21.580> at<00:01:21.670> Sparky

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
of things that we do here at Sparky

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.149 
of things that we do here at Sparky
well<00:01:22.780> this<00:01:23.049> is<00:01:23.200> one<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.380> my<00:01:23.530> favorites<00:01:23.979> because

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
well this is one of my favorites because

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.830 
well this is one of my favorites because
it<00:01:24.400> really<00:01:24.820> reveals<00:01:25.150> some<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.630> inner

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
it really reveals some of the inner

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.310 
it really reveals some of the inner
workings<00:01:26.439> that<00:01:26.799> go<00:01:27.040> into<00:01:27.250> making<00:01:28.090> movies<00:01:29.079> in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
workings that go into making movies in

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.240 
workings that go into making movies in
animatronics

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
animatronics

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280 
animatronics
for<00:01:30.610> example<00:01:30.939> baby<00:01:31.210> here<00:01:31.600> had<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> be<00:01:31.930> put<00:01:32.140> in

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
for example baby here had to be put in

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.740 
for example baby here had to be put in
water<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:33.040> couldn't<00:01:33.640> have<00:01:33.820> any<00:01:34.000> motors<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.600> it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
water it couldn't have any motors in it

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.350 
water it couldn't have any motors in it
so<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.290> entirely<00:01:35.710> controlled<00:01:36.340> by<00:01:36.909> gears

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
so it's entirely controlled by gears

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.600 
so it's entirely controlled by gears
pulleys<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:38.110> Springs<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:39.250> people<00:01:39.520> who

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
pulleys and Springs and the people who

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.920 
pulleys and Springs and the people who
would<00:01:39.730> operate<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.210> would<00:01:40.360> actually<00:01:40.659> work<00:01:40.780> as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
would operate it would actually work as

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.080 
would operate it would actually work as
a<00:01:40.990> team<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.440> puppeteers<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.460> try<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.880> give<00:01:43.060> it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
a team of puppeteers to try and give it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.240 
a team of puppeteers to try and give it
that<00:01:43.210> natural<00:01:43.570> fluid<00:01:44.290> motion<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:44.979> they

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
that natural fluid motion that you they

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.010 
that natural fluid motion that you they
needed<00:01:45.580> for<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.850> movie<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.870> is<00:01:46.990> a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
needed for the movie and this is a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.830 
needed for the movie and this is a
really<00:01:47.380> great<00:01:47.830> example<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:49.390> techniques

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
really great example of the techniques

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.110 
really great example of the techniques
of<00:01:49.990> both<00:01:50.200> collaboration<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.250> creativity<00:01:51.580> and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
of both collaboration and creativity and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.730 
of both collaboration and creativity and
solving<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.780> problem<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.110> how<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.260> make<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.500> a

that to solving problems that are

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.040 
that to solving problems that are
related<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.670> engineering<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.690> things<00:02:41.080> like

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
related to engineering so things like

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
that an engineer has to go through when
