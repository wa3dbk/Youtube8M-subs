00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.370 
the background which is almost white it
probably<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.899> coming<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> little

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
probably is coming out a little

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
probably is coming out a little
different<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.850> almost<00:01:57.000> white

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
different on that but it's almost white

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.550 
different on that but it's almost white
and<00:01:57.509> then<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.259> dark

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and then it I was like a really dark

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.690 
and then it I was like a really dark
navy<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.070> is<00:02:00.320> pretty<00:02:01.320> pretty<00:02:02.130> dark<00:02:02.460> like

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
navy that is pretty pretty dark like

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.929 
navy that is pretty pretty dark like
it's<00:02:02.850> close<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> block<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.990> um<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.700> like

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it's close to block so um I really like

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910 
it's close to block so um I really like
this<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.409> fraying<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this I like it because the fraying and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.290 
this I like it because the fraying and
everything<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.640> looks<00:02:08.789> really<00:02:08.849> cool

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
everything I think it looks really cool

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.000 
everything I think it looks really cool
so<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.129> I'm<00:02:11.250> gonna<00:02:11.400> wear<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
so I don't know when I'm gonna wear the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.970 
so I don't know when I'm gonna wear the
because<00:02:12.159> I've<00:02:12.310> never<00:02:12.519> been<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.819> huge<00:02:13.560> huge<00:02:14.560> fan

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
because I've never been a huge huge fan

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.490 
because I've never been a huge huge fan
of<00:02:15.010> blue<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:18.090> guess<00:02:19.090> I'll<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.540> figure

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
of blue and so I guess I'll just figure

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.929 
of blue and so I guess I'll just figure
something<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:21.099> i'll<00:02:21.310> probably<00:02:21.519> work<00:02:21.760> for

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
something out i'll probably work for

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.229 
something out i'll probably work for
summertime<00:02:22.299> or<00:02:22.480> something<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.290> um<00:02:23.939> got<00:02:24.939> that

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
summertime or something so um got that

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.690 
summertime or something so um got that
and<00:02:25.540> then<00:02:25.599> my<00:02:26.579> last<00:02:27.579> purchase<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.540> guess<00:02:28.750> is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and then my last purchase I guess is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.770 
and then my last purchase I guess is
going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.819> be<00:02:30.940> something<00:02:31.120> I've<00:02:31.360> really<00:02:31.540> wanted

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780

a mother-of-pearl and late in like a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.330 
a mother-of-pearl and late in like a
would<00:04:13.419> know<00:04:14.260> if<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.590> can<00:04:14.739> see<00:04:14.919> that<00:04:14.949> if<00:04:15.220> it's

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
would know if you can see that if it's

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.099 
would know if you can see that if it's
going<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.549> focus<00:04:15.940> but<00:04:16.150> looks<00:04:16.720> really<00:04:16.959> cool

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
going to focus but looks really cool

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.449

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
when it catches the light and I feel

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.719 
when it catches the light and I feel
like<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.760> lens<00:04:19.030> part<00:04:19.479> isn't<00:04:19.720> too<00:04:20.500> feminine<00:04:20.769> so

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
