clinically<00:02:33.239> dead<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.629> these<00:02:33.780> drugs<00:02:34.310> when

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
clinically dead on these drugs when

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.520 
clinically dead on these drugs when
we're<00:02:35.430> talking<00:02:35.670> about<00:02:36.180> our<00:02:36.569> children<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.440> I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
we're talking about our children and I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.780 
we're talking about our children and I
think<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.400> brought<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.269> point<00:02:39.629> up<00:02:40.790> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
think that you brought this point up it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.259 
think that you brought this point up it
really<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:43.140> question<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.940> children

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
really is a question because children

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.830 
really is a question because children
don't<00:02:45.630> have<00:02:45.989> any<00:02:46.920> choice<00:02:47.250> here<00:02:47.940> right<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.569> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
don't have any choice here right this is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.759 
don't have any choice here right this is
the<00:02:49.530> parent<00:02:50.120> giving<00:02:51.120> them<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.360> drug<00:02:51.630> or<00:02:51.989> if

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
the parent giving them the drug or if

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.890 
the parent giving them the drug or if
they're<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.190> foster<00:02:53.430> care<00:02:53.610> system

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
they're in the foster care system

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.430 
they're in the foster care system
perhaps<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.880> system<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.290> they're<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
perhaps that system is they're the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.559

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
people to think about this logically if

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.660 
people to think about this logically if
you<00:03:27.660> were<00:03:27.810> out<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.290> mind<00:03:28.470> hearing<00:03:29.400> voices

you were out of your mind hearing voices
seeing<00:03:30.389> things<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.870> didn't<00:03:31.200> exist<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.889> you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
seeing things that didn't exist if you

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.069 
seeing things that didn't exist if you
were<00:03:32.190> crazy<00:03:32.609> quote-unquote<00:03:33.450> crazy<00:03:33.720> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
were crazy quote-unquote crazy and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.170 
were crazy quote-unquote crazy and
someone<00:03:34.829> was<00:03:34.950> giving<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.459> drug<00:03:35.849> that<00:03:36.030> was

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
someone was giving you a drug that was

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.960 
someone was giving you a drug that was
making<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.630> feel<00:03:36.930> normal<00:03:37.319> why<00:03:38.280> would<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.760> not

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
making you feel normal why would you not

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.199 
making you feel normal why would you not
want<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.599> take<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:41.609> doesn't<00:03:42.030> make<00:03:42.150> any

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
want to take it it doesn't make any

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.349 
want to take it it doesn't make any
sense<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.799> at<00:03:43.950> some<00:03:44.190> point<00:03:44.359> the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
sense it's because at some point the

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.159 
sense it's because at some point the
person<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.319> patient<00:03:47.299> determines<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.720> drugs

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
person the patient determines the drugs

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.409 
person the patient determines the drugs
are<00:03:49.380> causing<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:49.980> problem<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.609> they<00:03:51.120> feel

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
are causing the problem and they feel

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.210 
are causing the problem and they feel
worse<00:03:51.690> when<00:03:52.019> they're<00:03:52.139> taking<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> drugs<00:03:52.950> and

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
worse when they're taking the drugs and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.729 
worse when they're taking the drugs and
so<00:03:53.669> they<00:03:53.849> try<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> stop<00:03:54.750> taking<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.470> drugs

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
so they try to stop taking the drugs

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.129 
so they try to stop taking the drugs
because<00:03:56.250> they<00:03:56.549> recognize<00:03:57.389> they<00:03:57.900> get<00:03:58.109> a

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
because they recognize they get a

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.770 
because they recognize they get a
spiritual<00:03:58.859> innate<00:03:59.340> message<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.480> these

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
spiritual innate message that these

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.870 
spiritual innate message that these
drugs<00:04:01.109> are<00:04:01.260> causing<00:04:01.680> damage<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.250> they<00:04:02.549> try<00:04:02.819> to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
drugs are causing damage and they try to

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.300 
drugs are causing damage and they try to
stop<00:04:03.299> taking<00:04:03.720> them<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.829> that's<00:04:05.069> because

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
stop taking them and that's because

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.479 
stop taking them and that's because
they're<00:04:05.669> so<00:04:05.819> highly<00:04:06.120> toxic<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:07.069> then<00:04:08.069> we<00:04:08.310> look

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
they're so highly toxic and then we look

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.150 
they're so highly toxic and then we look
at<00:04:08.669> children<00:04:09.180> as<00:04:09.389> a<00:04:09.419> potential<00:04:09.930> drug<00:04:10.680> market

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
at children as a potential drug market

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.400 
at children as a potential drug market
you're<00:04:11.760> talking<00:04:12.180> about<00:04:12.419> a<00:04:12.630> very<00:04:12.989> compliant

patient and the reason being their

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.819 
patient and the reason being their
parents<00:04:15.780> tell<00:04:15.959> them<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.229> take<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> drugs
