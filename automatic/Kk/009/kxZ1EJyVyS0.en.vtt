before I give it a legit review so I
went<00:00:16.109> through<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.529> bottle<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.490> now

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
bottle and the reason i waited is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.840

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
because i wanted to see if it would lose

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
because i wanted to see if it would lose
its<00:00:23.880> power<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:24.990> i<00:00:25.080> would<00:00:25.260> gain<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> tolerance

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
its power or if i would gain a tolerance

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.099 
its power or if i would gain a tolerance
to<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.430> or<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.510> three<00:00:27.750> or<00:00:27.869> four
