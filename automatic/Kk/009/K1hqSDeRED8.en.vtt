color<00:01:04.120> right<00:01:04.330> there<00:01:04.360> but<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:04.809> can't<00:01:05.080> really

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
color right there but I can't really

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.900

figure<00:01:05.500> out<00:01:05.650> they<00:01:05.860> do<00:01:06.010> them<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.460> I<00:01:06.520> just<00:01:06.730> left
