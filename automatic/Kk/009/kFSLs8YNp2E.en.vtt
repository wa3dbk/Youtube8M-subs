00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.770
 already have it at home will not need 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.390

 TV let's say so here it is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.570
 Looks like on a laptop 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:57.260
 It looks like here and so that from them, and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:02.010
 cable I showed you with a finger in general 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.360
 before you connect 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:12.030
 laptop to tv and tv and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:18.180
 I recommend turning off the laptop and only 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.480
 then c connect but laptop with 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.620
 TV so God forbid you 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.100
 nothing burned out the laptop is not yours 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:39.540
 favorite plasma after 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:43.340
 that's how this one's take off either or 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.940
 how they look on the diagram is all already 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.570
 clean and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:57.560
 or individually looking what you have 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.820
 tv general after you 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.440
 connected 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:08.670
 this laptop with tv is affordable 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:18.290
 by means by means of permissible on the wall 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:18.290
 cable and turn on the TV and choose 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.670
 choose a number in your settings 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.360
 TV the number of land cable there will be 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.910
 from land and take off two and so on 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.100
 it depends how much money there is 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.820
 the abundance of the pass and the families of the connectors you have 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:46.890
 provided on televisions 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:52.020
 after you have chosen this desired 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.010
 port if miacca was given in those TVs 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:01.209
 should you 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:04.480
 get out your picture and picture and 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:10.060
 your laptop picture on TV 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:16.289
 will have to match if you have this 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:22.889
 film and for example launched on a laptop 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:26.560
 the sound will go through the TV too 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:33.550
 sound and picture will go 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:40.360
 TV is another way of using 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:45.880
 which can connect the laptop to 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.750
 to your tv about through vag 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.260
 cable 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:57.550
 that's what it looks like this 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:01.210
 enemy cable but if you would be by 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:06.400
 before the cable let's connect your 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.260
 TV then you will not have sound 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.199
 only go through the laptop 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:18.520
 she tv will be displayed only 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:23.669
 only the picture in the TV settings 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:28.800
 my case on the subject was when I 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:33.880
 connected the laptop to the TV using 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:37.389
 Bug to for I chose the setting there 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.610
 I was written on sony bravia because 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:46.389
 and only then did my picture spill out 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.060
 but the sound was only that at 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.820
 a laptop 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:58.050
 there was no sound on the TV because 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:06:01.050
 this is it you proved transfers only 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.050
 the picture 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.940
 and here on the diagram 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:23.400
 It looks like this here in the diagram look 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:28.440
 enemy vaga connector so here you have it 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:33.389
 here if tabaga cable it will only 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:38.160
 sound is generally the most preferred 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:42.190
 option is hdmi cable 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.400
 dad means driving the cable you will have 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:49.620
 and sound 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.620
 transferred and the picture is generally 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:07:01.380
 will be fine 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:04.050
 In general, there is nothing difficult to use 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:09.370
 plug in your laptop 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:13.620
 play games and watch ethereal on 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.620

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.530
