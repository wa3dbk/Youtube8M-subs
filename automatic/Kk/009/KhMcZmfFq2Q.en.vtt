00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello guys, my name is Lena and already 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 four years I am on my youtube channel 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.389
 under the name elena864 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.260
 and today i want to offer a hairstyle for 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.120
 lazy 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.650
 This option always helps me out when 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.929
 he has absolutely no fantasy for me 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.850
 more complicated it is very simple in 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.400
 performance styling but it is perfect 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.289
 suitable for any occasion the most important thing 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 in this tab is the volume from the roots and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 also light sloppy curls immediately 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.529
 make a reservation and I am missing any 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 the volume on the hair is therefore what i have 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 now on the head is the maximum effect 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.559
 which I can achieve because he 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 immediately after washing the hair and this is an hour later 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 he does not volume completely disappears hair 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 become flat in general you eat 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 I wonder how to make this simple 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 careless styling then stay with me 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 and look further well and since absolutely 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 any hairstyle or styling begins with 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.129
 clean washed your hair already in advance 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.600
 washed therefore they are not such a engine 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.610
 state today took advantage 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 line and clean line is shampoo 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.149
 birch and also balsam conditioner 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.710
 I really like this shampoo 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.260
 absolutely not expensive it contains 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 80 percent birch decoction he's good 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.489
 washes hair and most importantly he 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.979
 it doesnâ€™t dry them at all 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.170
 so to create this styling for us 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.840
 I need the logic here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.330
 bad but the larger diameter who 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.909
 really better round comb then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 Some kind of comb necessarily foam for 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.060
 hair 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.250
 and of course I lived for hair label 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.150
 by the way, too, from the clean line and put it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.150
 on the hair roots 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.550
 in fact it all happens very 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.370
 quickly literally a few movements and you 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.740
 distribute all the foam over your head 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.630
 but only on the roots on the tip not 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.820
 need to wear and after we put 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.680
 pulling our foam upwards 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.630
 help hair dryer and also you are so round 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.350
 brushes so we have to create 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.350
 air volume 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 Further we will choose our curling iron and we wind 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.380
 curls strands on the face I wind 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.330
 all the way from start to finish well and locks 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.860
 throughout the rest of the hair i 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.930
 I twist only at the ends I try 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.060
 do not make clear and literal curls 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.450
 because everything should be maximally 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.450
 naturally and naturally 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.780
 without you finish winding up 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.370
 comb your hair 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.370
 strand with your fingers 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.800
 and of course for fixing your 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.930
 sprinkle with hair lacquer I Tomoko 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.880
 clean line fixation 12 hours 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.720
 so our hairstyle will last 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.740
 whole evening 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.290
 and voila your careless curls finished a 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.540
