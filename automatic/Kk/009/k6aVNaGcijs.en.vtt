it<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.500> was

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.240 

because<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.790> get<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.940> meet<00:02:10.150> people<00:02:10.390> from

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.420 

especially<00:02:17.990> here<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.560> are<00:02:18.590> five

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
especially here because you are five

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.700 
especially here because you are five
minutes

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.440 

like<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.280> was

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.080 

and<00:02:26.540> if<00:02:26.780> there<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.200> any<00:02:27.739> advice<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.370> into

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
and if there is any advice you into

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.740 
and if there is any advice you into
perspective<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.500> stuff<00:02:31.060> degree<00:02:32.060> water

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
perspective to that stuff degree water

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.910 
perspective to that stuff degree water
fast

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
fast

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
fast
make<00:02:35.520> sure<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> program<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.720> want

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
make sure that it's the program you want

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.500 
make sure that it's the program you want
to<00:02:37.020> do

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
to do

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.300 
to do
because<00:02:38.810> every<00:02:39.260> degree<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.890> slightly

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
because every degree is slightly

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.500 
because every degree is slightly
different

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
different

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.600 
different
this<00:02:41.659> will<00:02:41.840> tailor<00:02:42.080> towards<00:02:42.470> do

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
this will tailor towards do

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.960 
this will tailor towards do
but<00:02:44.150> maintain<00:02:44.660> than<00:02:44.840> mine

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
but maintain than mine

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.010 
but maintain than mine
when<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> started<00:02:48.390> my<00:02:48.450> degree<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> was

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
when I started my degree I was

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.690 
when I started my degree I was
interested

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:09.910 

so<00:02:58.599> maintaining<00:03:01.050> itself

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920 

I<00:03:10.920> didn't<00:03:11.610> run<00:03:11.730> any<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> sport<00:03:12.420> societies

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930

two<00:03:16.769> years<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:18.120> was

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.870 

yeah<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.130> was<00:03:23.280> different<00:03:23.460> from<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
yeah it was different from what I
