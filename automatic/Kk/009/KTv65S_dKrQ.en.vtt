00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.699
 free all girls boys well 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.600
 found on smart work cars this time is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.800
 cohesive 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 I made a file first while I'm at it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.019
 recording my beta channel talk 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 anyway, no guys, let's say that today 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.119
 you will see a game that is my first 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.009
 part with the sniper then excuse me 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.989
 very much if I click dr I don't know how to do it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.719
 either all of them at first adults 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 however a swarm with xpr now not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.020
 tell me it's not just clicks pr 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.430
 also called rewards for that with xp 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.690
 it remained very scarce and I also had 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.850
 age than in this match 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 so let's say the idea itself why 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.809
 don't break me for this reason 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 here we say that this part water is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.770
 life as much as 22 and I would like to talk to you about 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 useless team mates I had 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.500
 I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 or what 18 happens to us on 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 coop 2 or that I am not able to do 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.730
 a kill now the one in progress of 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.049
 armaments here the maximum 75 and in fact 42 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.270
 here he has already done more than half of it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.240
 team work so let's say that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.880
 I felt quite gassed here 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.880
 any case we say this game 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 let's say it's the emblem let's say if I have to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 say so to speak a part that happens to us of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.650
 usually no type where we have to do 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.450
 everything is our moment 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.390
 capable on and do nothing while four 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 the ports of attention however nothing 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.070
 we say that every time we are alone among 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.659
 parentheses when I was n't playing in a group 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.150
 in the sense that no one does his job 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.250
 true companions who don't even call us 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.439
 a web when he had served with that yes 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.329
 I am another escort to call a 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.820
 man was too much trouble from you I do 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.990
 then nothing I didn't put my face into 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 between place in this match for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.030
 protest this is this of theory 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.860
 this is the uselessness of the companions 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 in the meantime, almost of Iran 's 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 stock however we say that in my opinion i 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.869
 comrades that happen on the coop 2 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.579
 we say that they are really the most useless 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.520
 of all the ropes practically because 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.590
 because we start with the fact that the web is 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 a bloodthirsty per customer on the fans for 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.020
 make one so let's say most 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.840
 part 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.130
 coach players are as head of 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 fuck I'm not even able to make you 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.440
 move 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.710
 let's say that doing five pounds is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.080
 difficult boys but he could not do 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.570
 two something hallucinating and therefore already 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.460
 for this to say that the players of two 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.880
 they are the most useless of ati out 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.860
 from the group 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.250
 maybe you played in a group you managed to 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.950
 do even a little bit but let's say that in 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.110
 general this cod here to the comrades p 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.600
 nut of be never stop of 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.170
 repeat it as it is true 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.390
 and we say that this drives a lot 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.770
 camper as it is sometimes in 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.170
 some campers who don't know how to win in 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.170
 earth or type a double with sim 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.760
 betti electric shock claim and others 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.110
 positive things never happened to a jacket 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.600
 which was something incredible 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.900
 own camper with the anti shield 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.540
 revolt that has everything on the ground and sup1 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.730
 in corners 1 in the other is that the morbid 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.290
 puts anywhere is also trophy system 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.480
 census just of uuci and boys 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 I really threw up in that game 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.200
 there because it is the copy of unplayable 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.850
 just meanwhile they almost see my two 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.220
 notches how beautiful they are but also said 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.630
 after two and a half hours and we say that i 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.040
 guys call a swarm with two 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.410
 notches xpr is not exactly the best 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.390
 of life I could try you now 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.700
 we can expect a little bit 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.920
 let's say I'm on this channel 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.540
 today to recover that part of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.160
 public me with outros network that there 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.950
 he had collaborated so much 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.570
 that is, there is a period where present that 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.100
 to trucks only my video and type that 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.610
 came out of her eyes and when we tomb of 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.050
 the dead 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.940
 we have made this kind of agreement 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.100
 let's say and then let's say he gave me 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.320
 very good is a very large number of members 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.150
 Also from me so here's to say 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.400
 practically on my dropped channel 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.750
 reopen because I was hacked 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.490
 let's say I'm dealing with if I choose 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.280
 another time there is another channel 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.650
 or gameplay and sometimes zombie gleeks 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.690
 and other things so in short things in 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.380
 general sometimes from something else but 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.660
 are details 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.910
 meanwhile, the usual thing is a few fields 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.930
 so guys to the next video and not 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.930
