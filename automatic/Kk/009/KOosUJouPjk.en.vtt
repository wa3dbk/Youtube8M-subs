light bulb on the top glass up here it's

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.609 
light bulb on the top glass up here it's
a<00:01:31.090> little<00:01:31.300> tricky<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:31.810> not<00:01:32.259> too<00:01:32.410> difficult

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
a little tricky but not too difficult

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.859

of it so it doesn't fall you got to take

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.219 
of it so it doesn't fall you got to take
this<00:01:39.340> lexan<00:01:39.759> piece<00:01:39.940> up<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.509> out<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.840> just<00:01:40.990> pops
