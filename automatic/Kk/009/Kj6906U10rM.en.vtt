 [Music] 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.119
 today we are going to prepare cocacola chicken 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.590
 this is cooking step by step and these 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.770
 are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.770
 use 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.880
 then we can buy it as there was 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.850
 bought in this case in rooms we can 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.760
 chop 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.160
 [Music] 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.339
 or we can also use some steaks 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.339
 chicken 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.950
 as you like what we are going to do 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.950
 the first thing is going to be seasoning the chicken 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.220
 and we'll put it in a pot 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:03.130
 [Music] 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:09.519
 a can of cola 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.519
 [Music] 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.939
 then we put the tomato 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.740
 fried or tomato puree a little box 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:24.890
 approximately 300 grams 350 grams and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 then we will put 4 tablespoons of sauce 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:37.010
 barbecue 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:41.480
 [Music] 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.630
 We will put it over high heat until covered 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.789
 start to boil 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.920
 and once it's boiling already what 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.850
 we will leave uncovered so that the sauce 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.590
 reduce 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.830
 a very low fire that continues to boil 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.330
 approximately 30 minutes 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.159
 [Music] 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.429
 and wait for the sauce to reduce 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.490
 We will mix every so often so that 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:14.470
 it sticks 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:16.540
 [Music] 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.200
 and when we see that the sauce of neither 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.200
 thicker 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 we will remove from the fire 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.579
 you know if he wants it thicker the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.579
 sauce can leave 10-15 minutes more 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.800
 we will serve the chicken with some potatoes 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.680
 segments in this case but it can be with 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.540
 white rice is also very good and the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.540
