anyway here we go okay so I've been over

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.819 
anyway here we go okay so I've been over
linear<00:00:46.120> pans<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.450> few<00:00:46.630> times<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.170> my<00:00:47.290> videos<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
linear pans a few times on my videos and

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.130 
linear pans a few times on my videos and
basically<00:00:48.760> what<00:00:48.880> you've<00:00:49.030> got<00:00:49.270> is<00:00:49.450> a<00:00:49.780> line<00:00:50.110> of

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140

basically what you've got is a line of
notes<00:00:50.560> okay<00:00:50.860> linear<00:00:51.190> meaning<00:00:51.370> line<00:00:51.700> and<00:00:51.940> then

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
notes okay linear meaning line and then

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.550 
notes okay linear meaning line and then
when<00:00:52.390> it's<00:00:52.510> when<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:52.900> written<00:00:53.079> out<00:00:53.350> you've

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
when it's when it's written out you've

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.290 
when it's when it's written out you've
got<00:00:53.770> like<00:00:53.950> you<00:00:54.220> know<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.640> have<00:00:54.790> a<00:00:54.820> kick<00:00:55.090> than<00:00:55.270> a

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
got like you know we have a kick than a

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.030 
got like you know we have a kick than a
snare<00:00:55.570> than<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.900> hi-hat<00:00:56.230> but<00:00:56.710> they're<00:00:56.829> never

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
snare than a hi-hat but they're never

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.470 
snare than a hi-hat but they're never
sort<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.280> layered<00:00:57.520> on<00:00:57.640> top<00:00:57.670> of<00:00:57.880> each<00:00:57.970> other<00:00:58.150> so

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
sort of layered on top of each other so

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.900 
sort of layered on top of each other so
it's<00:00:58.570> just<00:00:58.630> one<00:00:58.930> at<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.110> time<00:00:59.290> so<00:01:00.010> really<00:01:00.790> easy

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
it's just one at a time so really easy

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's just one at a time so really easy
to<00:01:01.120> learn<00:01:01.290> quite<00:01:02.290> tricky<00:01:02.560> to<00:01:02.680> master<00:01:03.190> but<00:01:03.340> once

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
to learn quite tricky to master but once

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.950 
to learn quite tricky to master but once
you've<00:01:03.610> internalized<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.299> pant<00:01:04.509> it<00:01:04.659> gets<00:01:04.869> a

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
you've internalized the pant it gets a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.230 
you've internalized the pant it gets a
little<00:01:05.079> bit<00:01:05.259> easier<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.550> we<00:01:06.670> take<00:01:06.850> this

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
little bit easier so if we take this

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.700 
little bit easier so if we take this
little<00:01:07.300> pattern<00:01:07.720> which<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.320> like<00:01:08.560> from

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
little pattern which is like from

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.770 
little pattern which is like from
section<00:01:09.010> three<00:01:09.280> from<00:01:09.430> my<00:01:09.520> book<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:10.540> can<00:01:10.659> look

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
section three from my book we can look

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.899 
section three from my book we can look
at<00:01:10.870> this<00:01:10.960> little<00:01:11.170> right<00:01:11.680> left<00:01:11.950> kick<00:01:12.250> pan<00:01:12.580> which

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
at this little right left kick pan which

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.520 
at this little right left kick pan which
we<00:01:13.090> do<00:01:13.240> three<00:01:13.600> groups<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.960> three<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.200> we've<00:01:14.409> got

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
we do three groups of three so we've got

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.070 
we do three groups of three so we've got
one<00:01:14.860> two<00:01:15.220> three<00:01:15.250> one<00:01:15.909> two<00:01:16.090> three<00:01:16.240> one<00:01:16.600> two

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.960 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:17.620> they<00:01:18.100> were<00:01:18.159> right<00:01:18.490> left<00:01:18.729> kick<00:01:18.940> right

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
three they were right left kick right

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.820 
three they were right left kick right
left<00:01:19.360> kick<00:01:19.570> left<00:01:19.659> kick<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.380> then<00:01:20.560> we've<00:01:20.680> got<00:01:20.770> a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
left kick left kick and then we've got a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.190 
left kick left kick and then we've got a
group<00:01:20.979> of<00:01:21.100> four<00:01:21.310> right<00:01:21.820> left<00:01:22.180> kick<00:01:22.600> kick<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
group of four right left kick kick and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.920 
group of four right left kick kick and
we've<00:01:23.620> got<00:01:23.770> right<00:01:24.159> left<00:01:24.580> kick<00:01:24.909> at<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.090> end<00:01:25.150> so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
we've got right left kick at the end so

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.440 
we've got right left kick at the end so
if<00:01:25.990> we<00:01:26.080> skip<00:01:26.620> we've<00:01:26.740> got<00:01:26.890> sixteen<00:01:27.880> sixteenth

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
if we skip we've got sixteen sixteenth

00:01:28.450 --> 00:02:03.240 
if we skip we've got sixteen sixteenth

of standard ones I'll give you a few
examples<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.709> both<00:02:46.720> now<00:02:47.720> what<00:02:47.840> you're<00:02:47.959> going

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
examples of both now what you're going

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.870 
examples of both now what you're going
to<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.230> those<00:02:48.350> first<00:02:48.560> few<00:02:48.769> ideas<00:02:48.920> what<00:02:49.850> we

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
to have those first few ideas what we

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.520 
to have those first few ideas what we
can<00:02:50.060> then<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.660> can<00:02:51.019> start<00:02:51.260> rearranging

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
can then do is you can start rearranging

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.380 
can then do is you can start rearranging
and<00:02:51.980> voicing<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.370> how<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.549> like<00:02:52.820> still<00:02:53.180> stick

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and voicing it how you like still stick

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.640 
and voicing it how you like still stick
to<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> right<00:02:53.720> left<00:02:53.900> kick<00:02:54.110> bite<00:02:54.290> left<00:02:54.500> kick

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
to the right left kick bite left kick

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.150 
to the right left kick bite left kick
right<00:02:54.680> left<00:02:56.320> crash

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
right left crash

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.890 
right left crash
try<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.880> stick<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.390> but<00:02:59.780> this

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
try and stick to that but this

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.360 
try and stick to that but this
rearranged<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:00.470> already<00:03:00.620> hit<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.830> hi<00:03:01.010> hat<00:03:01.220> or

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
rearranged for already hit the hi hat or

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.800 
rearranged for already hit the hi hat or
the<00:03:01.400> snare<00:03:01.700> drum<00:03:01.910> basically<00:03:02.269> sees<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.660> couple

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the snare drum basically sees a couple

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.830 
the snare drum basically sees a couple
of<00:03:02.930> ideas<00:03:03.080> from<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.739> workbook<00:03:04.840> which

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
of ideas from the workbook which

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.449 
of ideas from the workbook which
hopefully<00:03:06.140> you'll<00:03:06.440> go<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.070> purchase<00:03:07.220> a

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
hopefully you'll go and purchase a

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.330 
hopefully you'll go and purchase a
little<00:03:07.790> look<00:03:07.910> at<00:03:08.060> there's<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.900> lot<00:03:09.019> more<00:03:09.340> here

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
