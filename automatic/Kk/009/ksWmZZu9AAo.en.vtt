not<00:01:52.200> having<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> extra<00:01:52.680> card<00:01:53.070> makes<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
not having that extra card makes a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.950 
not having that extra card makes a
difference<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.479> extra<00:01:54.689> card<00:01:54.869> could

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
be the difference between you going off

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.020 
be the difference between you going off
a<00:01:57.630> ton<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.369> off<00:01:59.460> or<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.729> really

a ton or kind of going off or not really

doing anything spectacular but going

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.450 
doing anything spectacular but going
second<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.290> bad<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.770> it'sit's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
second it's not as bad but it'sit's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.100 
second it's not as bad but it'sit's
stole<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:05.969> people<00:02:06.329> who<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.600> still<00:02:06.810> opt<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
stole thing people who will still opt to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.869 
stole thing people who will still opt to
go<00:02:07.200> first<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.310> every<00:02:08.489> single<00:02:08.640> match

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
go first I know in every single match

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.020 
go first I know in every single match
that<00:02:09.060> I've<00:02:09.149> played<00:02:09.390> oh<00:02:10.670> I've<00:02:11.670> always<00:02:11.910> wanted

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that I've played oh I've always wanted

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.400 
that I've played oh I've always wanted
to<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:12.390> first<00:02:12.599> I've<00:02:12.870> never<00:02:13.020> had<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> problem

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
to go first I've never had a problem

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
to go first I've never had a problem
with<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
with that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.600 
with that
I<00:02:13.920> mean<00:02:14.040> obviously<00:02:14.130> there's<00:02:14.430> situations

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I mean obviously there's situations

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.250 
I mean obviously there's situations
where<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.180> six<00:02:15.390> cried<00:02:15.540> would<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:15.990> helped

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
where that six cried would have helped

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
where that six cried would have helped
if<00:02:16.380> i<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.160> second<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.880> would<00:02:17.970> have

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
if i was going second and it would have

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.620 
if i was going second and it would have
been<00:02:18.150> better<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:20.370> that's<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.090> guess

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
been better but that's that's I guess

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.150 
been better but that's that's I guess
that's<00:02:21.930> why<00:02:22.140> they<00:02:22.260> implemented<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.770> new<00:02:22.800> role

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that's why they implemented the new role

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.340 
that's why they implemented the new role
I<00:02:23.480> want<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.630> how<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.780> guys<00:02:24.930> felt<00:02:25.170> about

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
I want to know how you guys felt about

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.170 
I want to know how you guys felt about
it<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:26.069> thing<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.310> also<00:02:26.430> really<00:02:26.730> noticed<00:02:27.030> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
it one thing I also really noticed is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.130 
it one thing I also really noticed is
hand<00:02:27.360> traps<00:02:27.569> are<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.930> mediocre

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
hand traps are kind of mediocre

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.960 
hand traps are kind of mediocre
especially<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> lot<00:02:29.130> more<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.520> now<00:02:29.670> than<00:02:29.700> before

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
especially a lot more so now than before

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.440 
especially a lot more so now than before
so<00:02:30.780> sure<00:02:30.930> you're<00:02:31.080> going<00:02:31.230> first<00:02:31.440> typically

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so sure you're going first typically

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.510 
so sure you're going first typically
mostly<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> main<00:02:33.780> deck<00:02:34.130> not<00:02:35.130> going<00:02:35.340> first

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
mostly in the main deck not going first

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.710 
mostly in the main deck not going first
rather<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.940> said<00:02:36.150> stay<00:02:36.270> in<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> main<00:02:36.570> deck

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
rather I said stay in the main deck

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.390 
rather I said stay in the main deck
because<00:02:36.990> if<00:02:37.110> you're<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.320> first<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> then

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
because if you're going first and then

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.570 
because if you're going first and then
your<00:02:38.580> main<00:02:38.730> deck<00:02:38.970> hand<00:02:39.900> traps<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.580> instant

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
your main deck hand traps are instant

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.660 
your main deck hand traps are instant
instantaneously<00:02:42.540> another<00:02:42.959> minus<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.530> you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
instantaneously another minus for you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.949 
instantaneously another minus for you
and<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.760> you're<00:02:44.910> running<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:45.300> than<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.720> hand

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and if you're running more than one hand

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:46.880 
and if you're running more than one hand
trap<00:02:46.140> which<00:02:46.320> typically<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.739> you're<00:02:46.830> running

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
five general I'd say um I think you kind

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.020 
five general I'd say um I think you kind
of<00:03:49.019> start<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> see<00:03:49.650> where<00:03:49.980> some<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> decks

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
of start to see where some of the decks

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.180 
of start to see where some of the decks
are<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.329> peeking<00:03:51.660> off<00:03:51.840> right<00:03:52.470> now<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.829> not

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
are just peeking off right now and not

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.590 
are just peeking off right now and not
mostly<00:03:53.489> because<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.850> rule<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.360> way<00:03:54.450> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
mostly because the rule just the way the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600 
mostly because the rule just the way the
format<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.200> going<00:03:55.560> right<00:03:55.860> as<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.400> right<00:03:56.549> now

format is going right as it is right now
I<00:03:57.000> mean<00:03:57.480> obviously<00:03:57.570> we<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:58.049> move<00:03:58.380> honestly

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
I mean obviously we just move honestly

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.259 
I mean obviously we just move honestly
just<00:03:58.980> made<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> transition<00:03:59.640> from<00:03:59.820> the<00:04:00.060> same

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
just made the transition from the same

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.000 
just made the transition from the same
format<00:04:00.690> minus<00:04:01.019> gear<00:04:01.230> years<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> same

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
format minus gear years to the same

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.000 
format minus gear years to the same
format<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.360> mean<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.959> mean<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.709> know<00:04:04.769> some
