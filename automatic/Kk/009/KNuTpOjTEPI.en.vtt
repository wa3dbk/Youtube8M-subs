know there's a ton of them I've had
about<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:35.940> 10<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> last<00:00:36.600> month

about what about 10 in the last month
I've<00:00:36.989> reviewed<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.090> on

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
I've reviewed so as you see the one on

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
I've reviewed so as you see the one on
the<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.570> which<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.140> white<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.770> on

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the right which is the white one is on

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
the right which is the white one is on
art<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> new<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> left<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.079> black

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
art the new one on the left is the black

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.139 
art the new one on the left is the black
one<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.890> dalvik<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.850> we're<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
one which is on dalvik so we're going to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.779 
one which is on dalvik so we're going to
check<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.600> some<00:00:45.629> stuff<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.789> first

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
check out some stuff with this and first

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.860 
check out some stuff with this and first
we're<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> jump<00:00:48.270> into<00:00:48.420> settings<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
we're going to jump into settings and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.040 
we're going to jump into settings and
see<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.710> faster<00:00:51.050> almost

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
see which one is faster almost

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.430 
see which one is faster almost
simultaneously<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:54.629> stateís<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.230> goes

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
simultaneously so our stateís which goes

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.670 
simultaneously so our stateís which goes
looks<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.980> art<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.670> faster

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
looks like art was a little bit faster

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
looks like art was a little bit faster
now<00:00:58.680> let's<00:00:59.070> jump<00:00:59.399> into<00:00:59.840> Google+<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.240> almost

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
now let's jump into Google+ so almost

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.580 
now let's jump into Google+ so almost
the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.659> art<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> tiny<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.700> faster

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
the same art with a tiny bit faster

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.760 
the same art with a tiny bit faster
let's<00:01:13.590> check<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.890> Twitter<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.290> will<00:01:19.409> spot

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
let's check out Twitter and it will spot

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.570 
let's check out Twitter and it will spot
the<00:01:19.920> same<00:01:20.479> same<00:01:21.479> speed<00:01:21.810> almost<00:01:22.250> let's<00:01:23.250> try<00:01:23.430> out

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the same same speed almost let's try out

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.620 
the same same speed almost let's try out
your<00:01:23.880> PI<00:01:24.090> GP<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:29.850> about<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.180> things<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
your PI GP now just about two things for

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
your PI GP now just about two things for
you<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:32.810> yeah<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> huge

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
you and then yeah so it's not a huge

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
you and then yeah so it's not a huge
difference<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.259> where<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> differences<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
difference but where the differences is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.300 
difference but where the differences is
battery<00:01:38.939> life<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.350> post<00:01:40.770> that'll<00:01:41.220> be

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
you're watching this on YouTube I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.340 
you're watching this on YouTube I
actually<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.210> battery<00:01:45.540> status<00:01:45.780> from<00:01:45.930> dalvik

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
actually have battery status from dalvik

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.310 
actually have battery status from dalvik
and<00:01:46.560> art<00:01:46.950> both<00:01:47.790> cycles<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.720> Wi-Fi<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and art both cycles are all on Wi-Fi and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.760 
and art both cycles are all on Wi-Fi and
art<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> whole<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.399> better<00:01:50.820> um<00:01:51.590> next<00:01:52.590> we're

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
art was a whole lot better um next we're

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
art was a whole lot better um next we're
going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> check<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> camera<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.420> I'm

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
going to check out the camera which I'm

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.709 
going to check out the camera which I'm
going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> move<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.020> box<00:01:55.259> into<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.570> have

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
going to move this box into you we have

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.990 
going to move this box into you we have
helped<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> picture<00:01:58.590> of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.370 

and<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.350> bond<00:02:04.620> hdr+<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.820> both<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.120> them

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
and this is bond hdr+ for both of them

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.080 
and this is bond hdr+ for both of them
so<00:02:07.380> let's<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.680> ahead<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.610> which<00:02:08.790> one<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
so let's go ahead and see which one is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:17.510 
so let's go ahead and see which one is
faster<00:02:14.690> almost<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> same<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.800> art<00:02:17.190> was<00:02:17.490> a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
faster almost the same but art was a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.230 
faster almost the same but art was a
little<00:02:17.820> bit<00:02:17.910> faster<00:02:18.300> now<00:02:22.910> let's<00:02:23.910> try<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.180> on

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
little bit faster now let's try it on

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.420 
little bit faster now let's try it on
auto<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.930> which<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.710> faster<00:02:25.920> let<00:02:26.340> me

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
auto and see which one is faster let me

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:37.850 
auto and see which one is faster let me
zoom<00:02:26.580> out<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.790> little<00:02:26.880> bit<00:02:27.030> more<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.420> you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.680 

hang<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.490> just<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> little<00:02:38.730> guy<00:02:39.090> hit<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
shutter button on the art so it's a tiny

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.870 
shutter button on the art so it's a tiny

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
bit faster um it's definitely noticeable

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.260 
bit faster um it's definitely noticeable
but<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:49.670> mean<00:02:51.140> some<00:02:52.140> apps<00:02:52.380> are<00:02:52.620> compatible

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
but I mean some apps are compatible

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.030
