not<00:03:28.750> always<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.049> good<00:03:29.170> thing<00:03:29.349> right<00:03:29.560> because

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
not always a good thing right because

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.459 
not always a good thing right because
with<00:03:30.189> with<00:03:30.489> variable<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.450> variable<00:03:32.230> zoom
