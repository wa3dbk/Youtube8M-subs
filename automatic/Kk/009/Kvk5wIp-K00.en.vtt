this one in a time when no one really

industry would have on the environment
now<00:01:03.670> however<00:01:03.999> we're<00:01:04.540> all<00:01:04.750> aware<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.170> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
now however we're all aware of the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.800 
now however we're all aware of the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.260 
impact we are having on the world around
us<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.200> how<00:01:08.590> important<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.550> to<00:01:09.820> minimize

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
us and how important it is to minimize

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.109 
us and how important it is to minimize
the<00:01:10.570> energy<00:01:10.990> we<00:01:11.170> use<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:12.189> Science<00:01:12.579> Museum<00:01:12.640> is

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
the energy we use the Science Museum is

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.149 
the energy we use the Science Museum is
a<00:01:13.149> great<00:01:13.540> place<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:14.110> learn<00:01:14.229> about<00:01:14.290> energy<00:01:14.950> and

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
a great place to learn about energy and

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.670 
a great place to learn about energy and
the<00:01:15.340> environment<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.600> one<00:01:16.930> man<00:01:17.200> has<00:01:17.470> been

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
the environment but one man has been

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.889 
the environment but one man has been
really<00:01:18.070> active<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.759> saving<00:01:19.240> energy<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.750> his

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
really active in saving energy in his

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.970 
really active in saving energy in his
own<00:01:20.140> home<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.920> I'm<00:01:21.220> off<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.549> meet<00:01:21.729> him<00:01:21.880> now

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.920 

so<00:01:27.980> it<00:01:28.040> Martin<00:01:28.430> your<00:01:28.610> house<00:01:28.790> wasn't<00:01:29.300> built<00:01:29.660> in

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
so it Martin your house wasn't built in

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.110 
so it Martin your house wasn't built in
the<00:01:30.020> age<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.590> energy<00:01:31.010> conservation<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.970> what

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
the age of energy conservation so what

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.910 
the age of energy conservation so what
have<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.330> managed<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:32.720> do<00:01:32.930> about<00:01:33.230> that<00:01:33.410> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
have you managed to do about that and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.230 
have you managed to do about that and
how<00:01:34.070> do<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.190> go<00:01:34.340> about<00:01:34.460> saving<00:01:35.000> on<00:01:35.090> your

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
how do you go about saving on your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.540 
how do you go about saving on your
heating<00:01:35.630> bills<00:01:35.840> that's<00:01:36.590> true<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.220> leaks

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
heating bills that's true it leaks

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.830 
heating bills that's true it leaks
energy<00:01:38.060> like<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.240> sieve

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
energy like a sieve

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680 
energy like a sieve
so<00:01:39.230> I've<00:01:39.470> installed<00:01:40.220> some<00:01:40.700> secondary<00:01:41.540> glazing

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
so I've installed some secondary glazing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.950 
so I've installed some secondary glazing
over<00:01:42.500> my<00:01:42.620> windows<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.340> blocked<00:01:44.300> up<00:01:44.540> my<00:01:44.690> big

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
over my windows I blocked up my big

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.780 
over my windows I blocked up my big
inglenook<00:01:45.500> fires<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.250> put<00:01:46.430> in<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
inglenook fires and put in a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.120 
inglenook fires and put in a
wood-burning<00:01:47.300> stove<00:01:47.540> which<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:48.620> much<00:01:48.890> more

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
wood-burning stove which is much more

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.780 
wood-burning stove which is much more
efficient<00:01:49.640> I've<00:01:50.390> also<00:01:50.750> installed<00:01:51.610> an<00:01:52.610> air

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
efficient I've also installed an air

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.330 
efficient I've also installed an air
source<00:01:53.090> heat<00:01:53.180> pump<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.080> takes<00:01:54.680> energy<00:01:54.950> from

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
source heat pump that takes energy from

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.790 
source heat pump that takes energy from
the<00:01:55.460> air<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:56.300> my<00:01:56.390> central<00:01:56.840> heating<00:01:57.260> it's<00:01:57.500> very

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
the air for my central heating it's very

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.460 
the air for my central heating it's very
efficient<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.210> about<00:01:59.450> four<00:02:00.140> times

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
efficient it you get about four times

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.490 
efficient it you get about four times
out<00:02:01.810> compared<00:02:02.810> with<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:02.960> energy<00:02:03.230> that<00:02:03.260> you

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
out compared with the energy that you

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.310 
out compared with the energy that you
put<00:02:03.710> in<00:02:03.860> I've<00:02:04.670> also<00:02:04.880> put<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.540> some<00:02:05.570> solar

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
put in I've also put on some solar

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.090 
put in I've also put on some solar
panels<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:07.610> generate<00:02:08.090> electricity<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.590> I've

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
panels that generate electricity so I've

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.310 
panels that generate electricity so I've
actually<00:02:10.280> made<00:02:10.760> quite<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.030> big<00:02:11.300> saving<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.140> my

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
actually made quite a big saving on my

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.870 
actually made quite a big saving on my
energy<00:02:12.650> bills<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.280> how<00:02:13.460> do<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.640> go<00:02:13.760> about

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
energy bills so how do you go about

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.750 
energy bills so how do you go about
checking<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> energy<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.070> use<00:02:16.100> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
checking on the energy that you use and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.940 
checking on the energy that you use and
save<00:02:17.090> our<00:02:17.510> we<00:02:17.750> have<00:02:17.900> all<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.290> controls<00:02:18.680> here

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
save our we have all the controls here

actually selling that back to the to the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.350 
actually selling that back to the to the
energy<00:03:54.370> supplier<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:54.940> if<00:03:55.030> they<00:03:55.090> aren't<00:03:55.240> using

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
energy supplier so if they aren't using

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.450 
energy supplier so if they aren't using
all<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.930> energy<00:03:56.020> generated<00:03:56.980> they<00:03:57.070> can<00:03:57.220> sell

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
all the energy generated they can sell

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.490 
all the energy generated they can sell
that<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.240> additional<00:03:58.480> money<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.470> a

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
that and get additional money so it is a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.860 
that and get additional money so it is a
way<00:03:59.710> that<00:03:59.950> not<00:04:00.760> only<00:04:00.820> do<00:04:01.090> they<00:04:01.240> reduce<00:04:01.750> their

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
way that not only do they reduce their

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.810 
way that not only do they reduce their
fuel<00:04:02.110> bills<00:04:02.290> but<00:04:02.890> they<00:04:02.980> can<00:04:03.130> also<00:04:03.280> get<00:04:03.610> money
