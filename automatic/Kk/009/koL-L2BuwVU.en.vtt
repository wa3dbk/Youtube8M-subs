thing I'm just gonna you guys know what
I'm<00:00:40.890> thinking<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.429> moment<00:00:41.639> right<00:00:41.909> now

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
I'm thinking at this moment right now

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.430 
I'm thinking at this moment right now
I've<00:00:43.649> always<00:00:43.979> tried<00:00:44.339> to<00:00:44.399> wonder<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.289> we<00:00:46.289> will

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
I've always tried to wonder this we will

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
I've always tried to wonder this we will
not<00:00:46.589> try<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.859> wonder<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.550> pondered<00:00:48.179> that

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
not try to wonder but I pondered that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.950 
not try to wonder but I pondered that
this<00:00:48.719> thing<00:00:49.129> how<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.190> girls<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.909> huge<00:00:51.389> asses

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
this thing how do girls we huge asses

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.919 
this thing how do girls we huge asses
clean<00:00:52.350> their<00:00:52.559> butthole<00:00:52.920> properly<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.839> to

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
clean their butthole properly you got to

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.479 
clean their butthole properly you got to
think<00:00:55.049> is<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> science<00:00:56.100> behind<00:00:56.339> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
think is there a science behind it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.219 
think is there a science behind it
because<00:00:56.609> when<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.079> way

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
because when you think about the way

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.209 
because when you think about the way
masses<00:00:58.889> and<00:00:59.299> huge<00:01:00.299> ass<00:01:00.510> cheeks<00:01:00.959> and<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.069> way

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
masses and huge ass cheeks and the way

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.800 
masses and huge ass cheeks and the way
it<00:01:02.399> closes<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.999> a<00:01:03.420> stinky<00:01:04.199> hole<00:01:05.540> how<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.690> they

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it closes up a stinky hole how are they

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
it closes up a stinky hole how are they
able<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.800> there<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.520> I'm

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
able to get in there do you know I'm

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
able to get in there do you know I'm
saying<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:10.230> think<00:01:10.410> about<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
saying like it just think about the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.840 
saying like it just think about the
circle<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.220> circumference<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.730> a<00:01:11.820> circle

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
circle in the circumference of a circle

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
circle in the circumference of a circle
let's<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.810> about<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.230> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.800> I'm

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
let's just think about that you know I'm

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.830 
let's just think about that you know I'm
saying<00:01:14.070> C<00:01:14.700> equals<00:01:15.030> PI<00:01:15.090> D<00:01:15.300> or<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.660> like

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
saying C equals PI D or something like

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.010 
saying C equals PI D or something like
that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.040 
that
you<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:16.860> say<00:01:16.980> pi<00:01:17.220> times<00:01:17.490> diameter<00:01:18.050> think

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
you don't say pi times diameter think

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.470 
you don't say pi times diameter think
think<00:01:19.410> about<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.370> half<00:01:20.670> circles<00:01:20.970> two

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
think about two two half circles two

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.010 
think about two two half circles two
full<00:01:21.780> semi<00:01:22.110> circles<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.980> that<00:01:23.160> weight<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
full semi circles with that weight and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
full semi circles with that weight and
they<00:01:25.020> gotta<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> middle<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> every

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
they gotta get in the middle of it every

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.010 
they gotta get in the middle of it every
time<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:28.050> properly<00:01:28.770> clean<00:01:29.100> their<00:01:29.340> asshole<00:01:29.820> out

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
time to properly clean their asshole out

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.790 
time to properly clean their asshole out
how<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.080> they<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:33.500> don't<00:01:34.500> I'm

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
how do they get in there I don't I'm

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.830 
how do they get in there I don't I'm
trying<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.610> saying<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.630> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
