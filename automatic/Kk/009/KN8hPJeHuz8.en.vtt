bring<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.590> Holocaust<00:00:47.220> survivors<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.540> speak<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
bring in Holocaust survivors to speak to

bring in Holocaust survivors to speak to
our<00:00:49.140> children<00:00:50.059> we<00:00:51.059> realized<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.230> won't

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
our children we realized that it won't

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.140 
our children we realized that it won't
be<00:00:52.590> very<00:00:52.620> long<00:00:52.860> before<00:00:53.040> we<00:00:53.730> don't<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150

be very long before we don't have that
opportunity<00:00:54.600> anymore<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.589> so<00:00:56.040> we<00:00:56.190> take

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
opportunity anymore and so we take

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
opportunity anymore and so we take

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.490 
with having them go to the Holocaust

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
Museum and so they experience that and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.560 
Museum and so they experience that and
we<00:02:11.100> link<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.550> up<00:02:11.580> collaboratively<00:02:12.330> with

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
we link that up collaboratively with

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.000 
we link that up collaboratively with
their<00:02:12.720> studies<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.200> English<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.800> Diary

of Anne Frank

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360

and<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.110> they've<00:02:16.349> got<00:02:16.530> two<00:02:16.770> different<00:02:16.980> ways

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and so they've got two different ways

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.790 
and so they've got two different ways
two<00:02:17.760> different<00:02:18.060> kind<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.540> guess<00:02:18.800> windows

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
two different kind of I guess windows

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.350 
two different kind of I guess windows
that<00:02:20.069> they<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.340> look<00:02:20.459> through<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:20.940> what's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
that they can look through to see what's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.510
