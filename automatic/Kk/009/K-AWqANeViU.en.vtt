00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
fairly effectively as a camo scythe if

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
fairly effectively as a camo scythe if
you<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.250> mix<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.210> camos<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> little

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you want to mix up your camos a little

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
you want to mix up your camos a little
bit<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.220> sort<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.430> leopard

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
bit and go for that sort of leopard

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.870 
bit and go for that sort of leopard
theme<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.350> does<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> very<00:01:56.700> good

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
theme then this does that to a very good

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.389 
theme then this does that to a very good
extended<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.570> would<00:01:57.689> expect<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.189> looks

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
extended you would expect and it looks

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.800 
extended you would expect and it looks
very<00:01:59.579> decent<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> camera<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> comes

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
very decent on the camera as it comes

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.749 
very decent on the camera as it comes
out<00:02:00.930> well<00:02:01.110> I'd<00:02:01.380> always<00:02:01.740> say<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
out well I'd always say this but the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
out well I'd always say this but the
black<00:02:03.060> ops<00:02:03.240> 2<00:02:03.329> cameras<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.930> opinions<00:02:04.290> have

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
black ops 2 cameras my opinions have

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.170 
black ops 2 cameras my opinions have
always<00:02:04.500> been<00:02:04.680> better<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
always been better just because of the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.359 
always been better just because of the
very<00:02:06.420> cool<00:02:06.689> effects<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.259> managed<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:08.069> on

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
very cool effects they managed to get on

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.040 
very cool effects they managed to get on
the<00:02:08.520> weapons<00:02:08.910> obviously<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> way<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the weapons obviously the way that the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
the weapons obviously the way that the
cameras<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.560> implemented<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.190> black

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
cameras have been implemented in black

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370 
cameras have been implemented in black
ops<00:02:11.550> 2<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.940> very<00:02:12.420> difference<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> ways

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
ops 2 a very difference the ways

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890 
ops 2 a very difference the ways
the<00:02:13.790> cameras<00:02:14.790> been<00:02:14.940> implemented<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.660> ghosts

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the cameras been implemented into ghosts

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540 
the cameras been implemented into ghosts
because<00:02:16.170> obviously<00:02:16.470> ghosts<00:02:16.980> can't<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.400> that

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
because obviously ghosts can't do that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
because obviously ghosts can't do that
for<00:02:17.730> whatever<00:02:17.880> reason<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:18.690> next<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.380> do

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
for whatever reason but next up we do

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.750 
for whatever reason but next up we do
indeed<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.520> abstract<00:02:22.250> which<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.430> quite

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
indeed have the abstract which I quite

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.940 
indeed have the abstract which I quite
like<00:02:24.030> because<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.260> fact<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> colors

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
like because of the fact that the colors

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.830 
like because of the fact that the colors
really<00:02:26.100> pop<00:02:26.190> out<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> ones<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.660> are

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
really pop out I like the ones that are

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.920 
really pop out I like the ones that are
more<00:02:27.960> colorful<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.180> designs<00:02:30.180> actually<00:02:30.480> work

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
more colorful and designs actually work

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.750 
more colorful and designs actually work
well<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> weapons<00:02:31.920> concern<00:02:32.220> over<00:02:32.310> designs

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
well on the weapons concern over designs

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.040 
well on the weapons concern over designs
are<00:02:32.970> cool<00:02:33.210> when<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> see<00:02:33.600> them<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> flat

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
are cool when you see them on a flat

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.110 
are cool when you see them on a flat
surface<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.800> when<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.430> applied<00:02:35.850> some

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
surface but when I actually applied some

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.820 
surface but when I actually applied some
of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> weapons<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:37.020> don't<00:02:37.170> always<00:02:37.380> come<00:02:37.800> out

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
of the weapons but don't always come out

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.340 
of the weapons but don't always come out
and<00:02:38.280> work<00:02:38.490> quite<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.000> well<00:02:39.030> because<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.110> 3d

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and work quite as well because of the 3d

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
and work quite as well because of the 3d
surfaces<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.010> that's<00:02:41.130> what<00:02:41.280> black<00:02:41.460> ops<00:02:41.640> 2<00:02:41.820> did

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
surfaces and that's what black ops 2 did

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.750 
surfaces and that's what black ops 2 did
really<00:02:42.150> well<00:02:42.360> whatever<00:02:42.900> reason<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.400> way

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
really well whatever reason and the way

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.310 
really well whatever reason and the way
that<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:44.970> cameras<00:02:45.330> applied<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.960> weapons

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
that the cameras applied to the weapons

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.500 
that the cameras applied to the weapons
look<00:02:46.830> too<00:02:47.010> awesome<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.820> far<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.150> haven't<00:02:48.300> had

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
look too awesome so far we haven't had

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
look too awesome so far we haven't had
any<00:02:48.570> additional<00:02:49.050> additional<00:02:49.740> news<00:02:50.160> as<00:02:50.370> to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
any additional additional news as to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040 
any additional additional news as to
whether<00:02:50.670> or<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.850> we'll<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.000> getting<00:02:51.540> any<00:02:51.780> more

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
whether or not we'll be getting any more

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.710 
whether or not we'll be getting any more
black<00:02:52.350> ops<00:02:52.500> 2<00:02:52.710> camo<00:02:53.040> plaques<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.520> assume<00:02:54.180> not

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
black ops 2 camo plaques I assume not

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.570 
black ops 2 camo plaques I assume not
because<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.380> haven't<00:02:55.890> had<00:02:55.950> anything<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
because we just haven't had anything in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.410 
because we just haven't had anything in
a<00:02:56.670> long<00:02:56.850> long<00:02:57.060> time

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
a long long time

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.480 
a long long time
I<00:02:57.660> think<00:02:58.080> we<00:02:58.200> may<00:02:58.380> have<00:02:58.410> gotten<00:02:58.500> all<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
I think we may have gotten all of the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.100 
I think we may have gotten all of the
additional<00:02:59.730> DLC<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.780> wouldn't<00:03:00.990> be

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
additional DLC that we wouldn't be

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.500 
additional DLC that we wouldn't be
getting<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.620> black<00:03:01.770> ops<00:03:01.980> 2<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.970> still<00:03:03.210> rumors

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
getting for black ops 2 the still rumors

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.760 
getting for black ops 2 the still rumors
going<00:03:03.690> around<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.110> still<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.470> people<00:03:04.680> that

going around and still on people that

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
it indeed when it comes to the reticle

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.800 
it indeed when it comes to the reticle
it<00:03:55.980> sort<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.400> goes<00:03:56.550> for<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.850> idea<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.390> having<00:03:57.630> a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
it sort of goes for the idea of having a

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.350 
it sort of goes for the idea of having a
space<00:03:58.320> or<00:03:58.680> gap<00:03:59.130> as<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.850> where<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> bullets

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
space or gap as to where the bullets

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.550 
space or gap as to where the bullets
gonna<00:04:00.450> be<00:04:00.570> going<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.050> then<00:04:01.170> like<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.350> little

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
gonna be going and then like a little

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
gonna be going and then like a little
circle<00:04:02.130> around<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.580> i<00:04:02.610> think<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:02.880> meant<00:04:03.000> to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
circle around it i think it's meant to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.540 
circle around it i think it's meant to
be<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.360> eye<00:04:03.770> but<00:04:04.770> i<00:04:04.830> generally<00:04:05.160> don't<00:04:05.459> like

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
be in the eye but i generally don't like

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.040 
be in the eye but i generally don't like
those<00:04:05.820> sides<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.270> prefer<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.660> sites<00:04:06.900> where

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
those sides I prefer the sites where

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.140 
those sides I prefer the sites where
it's<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.320> small<00:04:07.680> dot<00:04:08.040> exactly<00:04:08.730> where<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
it's like a small dot exactly where the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.850 
it's like a small dot exactly where the
weapons<00:04:09.450> gonna<00:04:09.630> be<00:04:09.720> shooting<00:04:10.110> rather<00:04:10.470> than

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
weapons gonna be shooting rather than

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.680 
weapons gonna be shooting rather than
than<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.220> space<00:04:11.610> but<00:04:11.850> if<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.030> do<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.300> space

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
than a space but if you do like space

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.690 
than a space but if you do like space
around<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.709> area<00:04:14.010> you're<00:04:14.100> gonna<00:04:14.160> be<00:04:14.340> shooting

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
around the area you're gonna be shooting

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.280 
around the area you're gonna be shooting
them<00:04:14.820> you'll<00:04:15.240> probably<00:04:15.420> like<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.720> reticule

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
them you'll probably like this reticule

cameras you're only gonna get a few
camos<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.800> definitely<00:05:39.159> recommend<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.729> nebula

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
camos I definitely recommend a nebula

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.029 
camos I definitely recommend a nebula
and<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.870> abstract<00:05:41.349> ones<00:05:41.530> just<00:05:41.680> because<00:05:41.770> of

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
and the abstract ones just because of

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.010 
and the abstract ones just because of
how<00:05:42.159> nice<00:05:42.430> they<00:05:42.610> look<00:05:42.639> generally<00:05:43.270> on<00:05:43.419> all<00:05:43.900> of

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
how nice they look generally on all of

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.510 
how nice they look generally on all of
the<00:05:44.110> weapons<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.590> how<00:05:44.740> well<00:05:44.979> they<00:05:45.190> apply

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
the weapons and how well they apply

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.370 
the weapons and how well they apply
apply<00:05:46.180> onto<00:05:46.360> them<00:05:46.690> and<00:05:46.840> here<00:05:47.050> we're<00:05:47.199> going<00:05:47.229> to

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
apply onto them and here we're going to

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.140 
apply onto them and here we're going to
be<00:05:47.469> getting<00:05:47.770> a<00:05:47.830> look<00:05:47.979> at<00:05:48.159> everything<00:05:48.669> included

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
be getting a look at everything included

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.050 
be getting a look at everything included
within<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.810> final<00:05:50.380> micro<00:05:50.830> DLC<00:05:51.370> item<00:05:51.759> that<00:05:51.880> was

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
within the final micro DLC item that was

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.659 
within the final micro DLC item that was
launched<00:05:52.509> today<00:05:52.719> which<00:05:53.409> is<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:54.039> nebula<00:05:54.460> pack

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
launched today which is the nebula pack

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.219 
launched today which is the nebula pack
and<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.880> reason<00:05:55.120> I<00:05:55.210> do<00:05:55.270> like<00:05:55.570> it<00:05:55.780> as<00:05:55.870> well<00:05:55.900> is

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
and the reason I do like it as well is

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.930 
and the reason I do like it as well is
because<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.710> reticle<00:05:57.039> works<00:05:57.340> very<00:05:57.610> very<00:05:57.699> well

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
because the reticle works very very well

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.420 
because the reticle works very very well
it's<00:05:58.599> like<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:58.900> cross<00:05:59.289> with<00:05:59.680> like<00:05:59.860> a<00:05:59.889> small<00:06:00.219> dot

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
it's like a cross with like a small dot

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.939 
it's like a cross with like a small dot
in<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.729> center<00:06:01.150> and<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.870> like<00:06:02.199> those<00:06:02.409> kind<00:06:02.740> of

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
in the center and I like those kind of

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.580 
in the center and I like those kind of
reticles<00:06:03.699> very<00:06:03.940> much<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:04.479> maybe<00:06:05.289> I'll<00:06:05.500> be

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
reticles very much and maybe I'll be

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.560 
reticles very much and maybe I'll be
giving<00:06:05.889> one<00:06:05.919> of<00:06:06.070> these<00:06:06.280> camels<00:06:06.849> a<00:06:07.150> go<00:06:07.389> with<00:06:07.539> a

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
giving one of these camels a go with a

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.469 
giving one of these camels a go with a
live<00:06:07.810> commentary<00:06:08.259> later<00:06:08.830> this<00:06:09.280> week<00:06:09.759> I<00:06:10.060> think

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
live commentary later this week I think

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.939 
live commentary later this week I think
I<00:06:10.539> won't<00:06:10.719> be<00:06:10.810> coming<00:06:10.960> organs<00:06:11.380> because<00:06:11.620> not<00:06:11.830> all

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
I won't be coming organs because not all

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.800 
I won't be coming organs because not all
who<00:06:12.070> stand<00:06:12.370> out<00:06:12.550> enough<00:06:12.669> but<00:06:13.120> the<00:06:13.270> nebula<00:06:13.690> one
