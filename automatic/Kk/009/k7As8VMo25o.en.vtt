kind of the center of our universe you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.010 
kind of the center of our universe you
know<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.910> doesn't<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.300> matter<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.809> you're

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
know it doesn't really matter if you're

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450 
know it doesn't really matter if you're

you're out pirating and hunting them or
if<00:00:46.770> nothing<00:00:47.129> else<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
if nothing else it's going to be just a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
if nothing else it's going to be just a
really<00:00:48.420> common<00:00:48.690> ship<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
really common ship so there's a lot to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
really common ship so there's a lot to
be<00:00:50.370> excited<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.449> because

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
be excited about with these because

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
be excited about with these because
you're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.469> everywhere<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you're going to see them everywhere that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
you're going to see them everywhere that
you<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.570> personally<00:00:55.140> most<00:00:55.350> excited

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you go what I'm personally most excited

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.840 
you go what I'm personally most excited
to<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.370> they<00:00:56.520> decide<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to see is how they decide to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
to see is how they decide to
differentiate<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.870> ships<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:58.680> current

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
differentiate these ships from current

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.709 
differentiate these ships from current
ships<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> already<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.329> because

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
ships that we already know about because

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
ships that we already know about because
there's<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.620> big<00:01:02.010> opportunity<00:01:02.789> here

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
there's a really big opportunity here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960 
there's a really big opportunity here
for<00:01:03.030> overlapping<00:01:03.899> roles<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.739> maybe<00:01:05.580> running

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
for overlapping roles and maybe running

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
for overlapping roles and maybe running
the<00:01:06.150> risk<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> making<00:01:06.750> other<00:01:07.080> ships<00:01:07.439> obsolete

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the risk of making other ships obsolete

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
the risk of making other ships obsolete
if<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.580> isn't<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.060> done<00:01:09.360> carefully<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
if this isn't really done carefully so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
if this isn't really done carefully so
let's<00:01:11.189> take<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> whole<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
let's take a look at the whole see a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
let's take a look at the whole see a
little<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.570> closer<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
little bit closer because that's the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170 
little bit closer because that's the
variant<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> most<00:01:14.909> about

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
variant that we know the most about

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
variant that we know the most about
right<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.439> whole<00:01:16.619> sea<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
right now and the whole sea is going to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
right now and the whole sea is going to
be<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:17.759> hundred<00:01:17.939> dollars<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
be going for two hundred dollars so the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
be going for two hundred dollars so the
Connie<00:01:19.470> Taurus<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> probably<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> closest

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
Connie Taurus is probably the closest

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.730 
Connie Taurus is probably the closest
comparison<00:01:21.479> based<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> role<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
comparison based on the role in the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700 
comparison based on the role in the
price<00:01:22.979> however<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> ship<00:01:24.810> stats<00:01:25.200> page<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
price however if the ship stats page is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.510 
price however if the ship stats page is
accurate<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.729> big<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.080> ?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
accurate and that's a big you know ?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
accurate and that's a big you know ?
there's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.790> differences<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.990> whole

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
there's a lot of differences the whole

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.800 
there's a lot of differences the whole
sea<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.740> five<00:01:32.100> times<00:01:32.400> longer<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.240> four<00:01:33.540> times

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
sea is five times longer it's four times

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.380 
sea is five times longer it's four times
wider<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.710> carries<00:01:35.159> almost<00:01:35.340> five<00:01:35.759> times<00:01:35.790> more

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
wider it carries almost five times more

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.200 
wider it carries almost five times more
cargo<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.470> only<00:01:37.590> 50<00:01:37.950> bucks<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
cargo and it's only 50 bucks more you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.969 
cargo and it's only 50 bucks more you
know<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.200> probably<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.799> ahead

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
know so I think we can probably go ahead

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
know so I think we can probably go ahead
and<00:01:41.130> start<00:01:41.430> making<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:41.909> assumptions<00:01:42.270> based

differences in potential speed I'm also

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.310 
differences in potential speed I'm also

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
on the stats page you know we kind of

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
start looking at the you know defenses

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.290 
start looking at the you know defenses
and<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.829> whole<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.310> only<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.819> appears<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and the whole see only really appears to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.089 
and the whole see only really appears to
have<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.750> man<00:02:10.020> turret<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:10.890> point

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.220 
have one man turret and one point
defense<00:02:11.489> turn<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:12.300> isn't<00:02:12.720> much

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
defense turn which isn't much

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.930 
defense turn which isn't much
at<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.500> based<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.220> ship<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.670> size

at all based on the ship of that size

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.119 
at all based on the ship of that size
you<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:15.989> I'm<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.379> speculating<00:02:16.620> that's

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
you know and I'm just speculating that's

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.320 
you know and I'm just speculating that's
a<00:02:17.220> point<00:02:17.430> defense<00:02:17.700> heard<00:02:17.879> who<00:02:18.030> knows<00:02:18.180> maybe

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
a point defense heard who knows maybe

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.850 
a point defense heard who knows maybe
that<00:02:18.540> ends<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.780> being<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> tractor<00:02:19.680> beam

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
that ends up being like a tractor beam

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460 
that ends up being like a tractor beam
or<00:02:20.040> something<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:21.049> top<00:02:22.049> of<00:02:22.290> all<00:02:22.440> of

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
or something like that on top of all of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.229 
or something like that on top of all of
that<00:02:22.650> both<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.129> these<00:02:23.370> ships<00:02:23.640> only<00:02:23.909> have<00:02:24.060> eight

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
that both of these ships only have eight

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.729 
that both of these ships only have eight
maneuvering<00:02:24.840> thrusters<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.470> when<00:02:25.650> you

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
maneuvering thrusters and when you

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.130 
maneuvering thrusters and when you
compare<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.220> ship<00:02:26.430> sizes<00:02:26.879> again<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.900> not

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
compare the ship sizes again that's not

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.170 
compare the ship sizes again that's not

whole sea and at least at its ability to
defend<00:02:32.310> itself<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:34.260> we're

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
defend itself so I think what we're

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.199 
defend itself so I think what we're
seeing<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:35.190> how<00:02:35.400> they're<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> avoid

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
seeing is how they're going to avoid

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.449 
seeing is how they're going to avoid
obsolescence<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.260> would<00:02:37.890> expect<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> whole

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
obsolescence I would expect the whole

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.119 
obsolescence I would expect the whole
series<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.690> them<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.349> be<00:02:40.500> big<00:02:40.799> for<00:02:40.980> their

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
series all of them to be big for their

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.280 
series all of them to be big for their
price<00:02:41.400> point<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.879> really<00:02:42.629> have<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> ability

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
price point and really have the ability

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.289 
price point and really have the ability
to<00:02:43.319> carry<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> crap<00:02:44.129> load<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.400> cargo<00:02:44.670> but

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
to carry a crap load of cargo but

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.699 
to carry a crap load of cargo but
they're<00:02:45.450> likely<00:02:45.900> going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.470> some

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
they're likely going to have some

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.380 
they're likely going to have some
downsides<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.549> think<00:02:48.000> they're<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.269> be

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
downsides I think they're going to be

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
downsides I think they're going to be
slow<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.079> think<00:02:49.410> they're<00:02:49.530> going<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.890> hard<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
slow I think they're going to be hard to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.099 
slow I think they're going to be hard to
steer<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.120> don't<00:02:51.420> expect<00:02:51.599> them<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> have

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
steer and I don't expect them to have

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.410 
steer and I don't expect them to have
much<00:02:52.319> teeth<00:02:52.760> now<00:02:53.760> they<00:02:53.910> may<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.180> good

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
much teeth now they may have good

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.229 
much teeth now they may have good
shields<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.049> they<00:02:55.109> may<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.319> kind<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.769> tanki

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
shields and they may be kind of tanki

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.610 
shields and they may be kind of tanki
but<00:02:57.239> they're<00:02:57.420> likely<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.170> really<00:02:58.410> have

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
but they're likely going to really have

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
but they're likely going to really have
to<00:02:58.680> rely<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.099> escorts<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.940> ensure<00:03:00.209> their

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
target overall isn't always a good thing

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.849 
target overall isn't always a good thing
so<00:03:21.329> while<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.750> opportunity<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:22.530> higher

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
so while the opportunity for higher

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.500 
so while the opportunity for higher
profits<00:03:23.459> may<00:03:23.609> be<00:03:23.669> there<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.150> think<00:03:24.359> there's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
profits may be there I think there's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.539 
profits may be there I think there's
some<00:03:24.660> really<00:03:24.810> good<00:03:25.079> risks<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.919> may<00:03:26.160> kind<00:03:26.430> of

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
some really good risks that may kind of

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.370 
some really good risks that may kind of
way<00:03:26.760> into<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.180> equation<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.840> which<00:03:27.989> ship<00:03:28.260> you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
way into that equation on which ship you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.470 
way into that equation on which ship you
decide<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.889> want<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.099> go<00:03:29.160> for<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.209> it's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
decide that you want to go for so it's

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.089 
decide that you want to go for so it's
really<00:03:30.780> hard<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.260> kind<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.500> speculate<00:03:31.980> about

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
really hard to kind of speculate about

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.440 
really hard to kind of speculate about
what<00:03:32.370> we're<00:03:32.549> going<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:32.910> from<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> others

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
what we're going to see from the others

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.819 
what we're going to see from the others
because<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:33.750> don't<00:03:34.109> have<00:03:34.200> as<00:03:34.590> much

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
because we don't have as much

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.259 
because we don't have as much
information<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.730> them<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.209> to

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
information on them but I'm going to

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.610 
information on them but I'm going to
take<00:03:36.359> some<00:03:36.510> wild<00:03:36.780> guesses<00:03:37.019> here<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.440> let<00:03:37.530> me

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
take some wild guesses here and let me

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.960 
take some wild guesses here and let me
know<00:03:37.650> what<00:03:37.859> you<00:03:37.980> think<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.519> far<00:03:38.549> as<00:03:38.819> where

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
know what you think as far as where

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.909 
know what you think as far as where
these<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.299> going<00:03:39.419> to<00:03:39.480> land<00:03:39.690> I'm<00:03:40.500> sort<00:03:40.859> of

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
these are going to land I'm sort of

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:41.960 
these are going to land I'm sort of
thinking<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.310> we're<00:03:41.459> going<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.609> see<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
thinking that we're going to see the a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.300 
thinking that we're going to see the a
variant<00:03:42.780> caring<00:03:43.410> about<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.829> much<00:03:44.099> as<00:03:44.160> a

variant caring about as much as a

variant caring about as much as a

freelancer somewhere in the 200 300
frightened<00:03:47.220> unit<00:03:47.430> category<00:03:48.049> maybe<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.230> B<00:03:49.470> is

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
frightened unit category maybe the B is

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.280 
frightened unit category maybe the B is
carrying<00:03:50.069> around<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:51.269> know<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.389> thousand<00:03:52.079> 48

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
carrying around you know a thousand 48

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.809 
carrying around you know a thousand 48
units<00:03:52.530> like<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.859> Andromeda<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.389> D<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.819> 1.7

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
units like in Andromeda now the D is 1.7

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.059 
units like in Andromeda now the D is 1.7
times<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.239> price<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> sea<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.470> if<00:03:58.739> we<00:03:58.769> kind

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
times the price of the sea so if we kind

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.650 
times the price of the sea so if we kind
of<00:03:59.099> extrapolate<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.879> look<00:04:00.209> at<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.389> cargo

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
of extrapolate that look at the cargo

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.420 
of extrapolate that look at the cargo
then<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.440> would<00:04:01.590> mean<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.010> D<00:04:02.190> could

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
then that would mean that the D could

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.789 
then that would mean that the D could
then<00:04:02.549> potentially<00:04:03.060> carry<00:04:03.319> 15,000<00:04:04.319> 48<00:04:04.530> units

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
then potentially carry 15,000 48 units

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.979 
then potentially carry 15,000 48 units
and<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.579> E<00:04:05.609> which<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.269> two<00:04:06.389> point<00:04:06.629> seven<00:04:06.810> five

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
and the E which is two point seven five

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.559 
and the E which is two point seven five
times<00:04:07.500> more<00:04:07.709> expensive<00:04:07.799> than<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.280> sea<00:04:08.639> you

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
times more expensive than the sea you

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.909 
times more expensive than the sea you
know<00:04:09.660> if<00:04:09.720> we<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.079> for<00:04:10.260> cargo<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.859> a

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
know if we do that for cargo all of a

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.830 
know if we do that for cargo all of a
sudden<00:04:11.129> we're<00:04:11.220> looking<00:04:11.430> at<00:04:11.519> about<00:04:11.840> 25,000

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
sudden we're looking at about 25,000

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.289 
sudden we're looking at about 25,000
Freight<00:04:13.109> units<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.829> now<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.730> doubt<00:04:15.030> that

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
Freight units on that now I doubt that

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.670 
Freight units on that now I doubt that
it's<00:04:15.449> going<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.599> be<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.959> simple<00:04:16.199> so<00:04:16.530> maybe

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
it's going to be that simple so maybe

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.650 
it's going to be that simple so maybe
we're<00:04:16.919> looking<00:04:17.220> at<00:04:17.340> cargo<00:04:17.729> numbers<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:18.299> you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
we're looking at cargo numbers on you

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.060 
we're looking at cargo numbers on you
know<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.780> these<00:04:19.169> aren't<00:04:19.410> really<00:04:19.620> dead<00:04:19.829> on

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
know that these aren't really dead on

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.649 
know that these aren't really dead on
but<00:04:20.370> maybe<00:04:20.519> we<00:04:20.729> start<00:04:20.880> seeing<00:04:21.120> other<00:04:21.269> things

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
but maybe we start seeing other things

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.420 
but maybe we start seeing other things
like<00:04:21.900> maybe<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.349> larger<00:04:22.800> variance<00:04:23.010> have<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
like maybe the larger variance have the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.000 
like maybe the larger variance have the
ability<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.820> carry<00:04:24.210> those<00:04:24.419> gigantic<00:04:25.169> spider

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
ability to carry those gigantic spider

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.080 
ability to carry those gigantic spider
mining<00:04:26.550> drones

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
mining drones

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.240 
mining drones
or<00:04:27.870> maybe<00:04:28.050> they<00:04:28.260> can<00:04:28.440> fill<00:04:28.620> somewhat<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.160> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
or maybe they can fill somewhat of the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.100 
or maybe they can fill somewhat of the
starfarers<00:04:29.880> role<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.240> carry<00:04:30.449> fuel<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:30.990> do

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
starfarers role and carry fuel and do

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.560 
starfarers role and carry fuel and do
mid<00:04:31.350> flight<00:04:31.620> operations<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.520> don't<00:04:33.180> know<00:04:33.330> but

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
mid flight operations I don't know but

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.180 
mid flight operations I don't know but
Friday's<00:04:34.230> coming<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.860> think<00:04:35.010> we're<00:04:35.100> going

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
Friday's coming and I think we're going

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.890 
Friday's coming and I think we're going
to<00:04:35.310> get<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.460> better<00:04:35.669> idea<00:04:35.760> soon<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.600> would

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
to get a better idea soon but I would

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.750 
to get a better idea soon but I would
expect<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.500> see<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.040> general<00:04:38.430> idea

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
expect to see that the general idea

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760 
expect to see that the general idea
behind<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.180> whole<00:04:39.330> series<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.750> it's<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.560> good

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
behind the whole series is it's a good

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.469 
behind the whole series is it's a good
point<00:04:40.949> A<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.160> point<00:04:41.310> B<00:04:41.580> transporter<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:42.389> you

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
point A to point B transporter but you

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.909 
point A to point B transporter but you
probably<00:04:42.750> don't<00:04:43.020> want<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.410> do<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.620> on<00:04:43.710> your<00:04:43.740> own

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
probably don't want to do it on your own

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.710 
probably don't want to do it on your own
if<00:04:44.190> you're<00:04:44.729> running<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.120> more<00:04:45.330> dangerous

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
if you're running in more dangerous
