00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.550 
quite interesting but anyways I guess
the<00:01:30.299> saddle<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> maybe<00:01:31.229> even<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.530> bit

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the saddle up and maybe even a bit

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
the saddle up and maybe even a bit
tuning<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> quantum<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.579> these<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
tuning of the quantum all these and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.990 
tuning of the quantum all these and
farmington<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.900> continent<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.820> joint<00:01:35.820> ones

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
farmington to continent the joint ones

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.130 
farmington to continent the joint ones
it's<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.509> being<00:01:36.600> pretty<00:01:36.780> much<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.020> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it's just being pretty much if this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's just being pretty much if this
episode<00:01:37.500> guys<00:01:37.740> obviously<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.579> next<00:01:38.939> time

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
episode guys obviously will next time

00:01:39.180 --> 00:02:52.550 
episode guys obviously will next time
and<00:01:39.390> enjoy<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.409> outro<00:01:41.250> music

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.620
