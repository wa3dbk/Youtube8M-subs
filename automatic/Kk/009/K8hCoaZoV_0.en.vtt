 read more the types are now solid again and thus another July 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.859
 We can get to the small screen project 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.189
 No said 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.220
 Mr Bear the bears are once on the iPhone stick on it 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.909
 so a merit of our house business is not yet clear 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.289
 sda 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.759
 As I said at the time of t both thanks for the great time 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.280
 Ellen year 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.510
 first step it would be 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.530
 Alphonse 1 1 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.310
 Helen Yu I have always been the most successful girl 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 to fix the said his first bets 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.060
 a year 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.040
 So everything is quiet 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.270
 spick and span 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.390
 on the other hand, you can do something 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.620
 launched 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.580
 still dry down 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.410
 Plettenberg 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.520
 and then he wants to be from the project 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.210
 something to it 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 Rampage Tina a huge gaynor 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.610
 and also here in the first quarter 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.260
 Scalo what we expect 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.410
 or even the claim to stay so I'm here wants to give it all 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.090
 Jérôme pulls it on it almost only briefly 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.990
 then there's the at &amp; t-share Dallas is always pretty afterward 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.620
 badly cleared 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.460
 since one year the front four years later comes 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.390
 Sio now 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 it's just that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.060
 where they are us 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.720
 he is one of them 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.160
 and 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 that's how it must be 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.830
 really taken seriously 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.790
 a bit more time in the league than a bit too little 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.260
 his successor in office will not be 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.880
 "Every time, of course, the critics watch it said 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.260
 once briefly under 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.109
 to pursue something further 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.109
 top left 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 now it is necessary to stand very low 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.199
 Let's have a look » 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.469
 as much as possible to look more than too little as planned 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.849
 Jan determines the tempo ounces and quite well 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.429
 as long as nobody is under here 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.059
 maybe that's not enough 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.669
 that so he must first be that the complaint made Mitterer's child 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.959
 nothing new 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.549
 I can not easily remember 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.549
 so and Noranda does not respect that you can pull off 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.399
 My fish in the pond has been painted in the middle 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.019
 you can not go that far for a long time 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.969
 and always from one side of the edge 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.269
 to the other side of the edge, both sides start making music 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.839
 Appointment at 8 the page

 in Bissingen Wolski to the bubble 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.489
 then you can meet another one 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.829
 szo 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.389
 «Now I have the 'three' on the rails to agree 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.669
 around 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.669
 Nied to the page Dinnebier 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.679
 below in the description 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.059
 so tall 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.930
 now I do not go I do not always go well not sucked out 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.339
 once more 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:04.449
 Everything looks perfect in her, he fits the program quite well 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.169
 de Castro declared not to picture I say 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.829
 Win en suite 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.109
 and now take sort of processed as said again beware that Kolumba 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.109
 Knee for example still sticks on the place 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.299
 if we are there by the way 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.710
 Ruud 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.710
 Just give set too high 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.210
 Traud 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.900
 we did not succeed 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.900
 sigh 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.100
 About a year ago without "Harry Potter" teenagers figure something out 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.789
 this is also on it again 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.569
 Supports Master Trimet Reform Course Rome 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.569

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.749
 Compass is he Mr. Schmitz took prize 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.339
 I give that to crying and super fast reminds 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.160
 RN 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.419
 Blackstone is then 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.259
 approximately 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.889
 Head a little less 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.409
 the ancient story from the gig 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.520
 front and back 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.670
 and everything is hidden 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.389
 on the pages of the yen 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.349
 from yes, yes, the third layer 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.659
 when she said Bye Bye 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.770
