that<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.770> already<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> flat<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.730> they're

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that are already in the flat so they're

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.549 
that are already in the flat so they're
all<00:00:44.969> placed<00:00:45.239> where<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> I

all placed where you want them to be I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.869 
all placed where you want them to be I
actually<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> where<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> furniture<00:00:47.670> was

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
actually like to where the furniture was

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.279 
actually like to where the furniture was
placed<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.270> my<00:00:48.360> room<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.899> didn't<00:00:49.110> change

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
placed in my room so it didn't change

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.260 
placed in my room so it didn't change
that<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.860> thing<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.190> did<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.670> was

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that but one thing I did do was

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
that but one thing I did do was
rearrange<00:00:51.660> where<00:00:51.750> everything<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.350> kept<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
rearrange where everything was kept in

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.860 
rearrange where everything was kept in
the<00:00:52.920> kitchen<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.910> possibly<00:00:54.300> sounds<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.750> little

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the kitchen it possibly sounds a little

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
the kitchen it possibly sounds a little
silly<00:00:55.170> perhaps<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.039> basically<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
silly perhaps but basically you need to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
silly perhaps but basically you need to
take<00:00:57.120> ownership<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> space<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
take ownership of the space and if you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
take ownership of the space and if you
don't<00:00:58.739> rearrange<00:00:59.010> things<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> put<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
don't rearrange things and put them in a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
don't rearrange things and put them in a
place<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.510> feels<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.320> you
