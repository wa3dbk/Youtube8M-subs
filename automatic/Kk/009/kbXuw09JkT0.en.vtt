00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.520
 Puntonet of friends here we are with the 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.790
 samsung galaxy s 4 for a fast 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.440
 unboxing before going to perform 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.050
 a more in-depth review of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.970
 this smartphone 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.980
 meanwhile we immediately see from the box that 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.289
 it's different than that of the galaxy s 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.940
 iii the samsung smartphone tools up to 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.760
 today recycled cardboard and therefore between 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:42.829
 also eco-sustainable quotes let's go 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:45.040
 to remove the seals and we have 2 1 e 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.040
 2 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.670
 we raise the lid and in the foreground the 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.800
 galaxy s 4 you don't call me but aside 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.899
 my see we could inside the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.280
 package of manuals then there 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.680
 will be warranty information 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.610
 as well as the use of micro usb cable 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.110
 whites because in this case of one 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.140
 the strips also white 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.810
 they are in recycled paper charger 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:25.610
 typical of samsung involves covered le 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:29.360
 2600 milan usb battery for we will do 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.159
 then a focus later on headphones a di 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.409
 these near like 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.719
 in the predecessor s3 and we will try the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.159
 quality hd these headphones with connector 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.670
 and gilded and finally some municipalities of 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.590
 replacement of the headphones 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.659
 inside we find only paper 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.530
 character s4 to take only 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.299
 very light because it has no battery 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:11.269
 we open we remove the film in this 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:13.970
 case is black we remove the whole plastic 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.989
 well wrapped we have other practices that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.540
 but we are not taking away from this 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.760
 moment and let's make a quick comparison 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.650
 with andrea as of messina as a network 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.430
 we have almost the same dimensions 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:33.620
 after the thinner shot than the 3 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.709
 the height is practically identical and the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.599
 width maybe even slightly 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:45.739
 minor on s4 as I would do it 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.889
 a bit to oval let's say while the always 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.680
 more at the arena piedrita mo button 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.060
 slightly longer but the differences 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.819
 they are not so many starting 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.470
 display that is full hd 5 inch and that 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.919
 is the front camera which is of type 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.120
 which can record videos up to 1080p 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.750
 like the one on the back that in this case 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.069
 ds4 is 300 pixels 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.620
 however for the moment it is all there 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.870
 let's try here we will do as already mentioned 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 recession depth and between some 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.400
 day we will focus on the battery on 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.130
 functionality of this craxi s4 that I am 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.799
 really so many features 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.740
 software we have as many as eight sensors 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.970
 they are exploited to the maximum e 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.170
 so for the moment it's all from mine 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.170
 screaming at him
