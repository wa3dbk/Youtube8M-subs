that<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.340> only<00:02:02.549> problem<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.329> these<00:02:03.689> two

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that the only problem with these two

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
that the only problem with these two
clips<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.950> clip<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.610> twix<00:02:06.240> turd<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.600> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
clips are this clip is twix turd in this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.440 
clips are this clip is twix turd in this
clip<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.710> he's<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.520> spinning<00:02:09.000> his<00:02:09.090> ass<00:02:09.209> off

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
effects flow better is you're going to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.960 
effects flow better is you're going to
want<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.800> second<00:02:19.130> clip<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.550> twix<00:02:19.790> surd

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
want this second clip to be twix surd

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.580 
want this second clip to be twix surd
but<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.360> took<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:20.810> wellies<00:02:21.050> amid<00:02:21.470> are

but if I took your wellies amid are

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.570 
but if I took your wellies amid are
spinning<00:02:22.040> won't<00:02:22.760> look<00:02:22.910> too<00:02:23.090> good<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:24.740> yeah<00:02:25.220> I'm

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
spinning won't look too good so yeah I'm

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.650 
spinning won't look too good so yeah I'm
just<00:02:25.700> going<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.910> keep<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.180> at<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.630> now

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
and name this transition so uh now we'll

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.970 
and name this transition so uh now we'll
split<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> layer<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.630> go<00:02:53.750> forward<00:02:54.110> 30

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
split the layer here and go forward 30

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.700 
split the layer here and go forward 30
frames<00:02:55.370> split<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.210> here<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.170> we're<00:02:57.650> gonna

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
frames split it here and we're gonna

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.650 
frames split it here and we're gonna
want<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.070> add<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.220> few<00:02:58.550> effects<00:02:58.940> on<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.270> this<00:02:59.420> now

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
want to add a few effects on to this now

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.210 
want to add a few effects on to this now
we're<00:03:00.020> gonna<00:03:00.110> win<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> headway<00:03:01.180> warp<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:03.220> dragged

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
we're gonna win a headway warp I dragged

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.220 
we're gonna win a headway warp I dragged
at<00:03:04.400> home<00:03:04.630> you're<00:03:05.630> gonna<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.050> have<00:03:06.260> noise

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
at home you're gonna want to have noise

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.170 
at home you're gonna want to have noise
noise<00:03:09.230> &amp;<00:03:09.380> Grain<00:03:09.740> noise<00:03:10.040> i'm<00:03:10.550> gonna<00:03:10.760> put<00:03:10.940> bring

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
noise &amp; Grain noise i'm gonna put bring

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.810 
noise &amp; Grain noise i'm gonna put bring
the<00:03:11.330> noise<00:03:11.480> at<00:03:11.750> six<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:13.280> we're<00:03:13.430> gonna<00:03:13.520> want<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
the noise at six and we're gonna want to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.930 
the noise at six and we're gonna want to
have<00:03:14.830> turbulent<00:03:16.000> displace<00:03:17.890> bring<00:03:18.890> down<00:03:19.100> so

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
have turbulent displace bring down so

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.540 
have turbulent displace bring down so
here<00:03:20.780> we're<00:03:21.650> going<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.860> want<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.280> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
here we're going to want to have the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.950 
here we're going to want to have the
wave<00:03:23.060> with<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.660> about<00:03:23.900> 500<00:03:24.830> ish<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.750> we're

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
wave with that about 500 ish and we're

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.390 
wave with that about 500 ish and we're
going<00:03:26.990> to<00:03:27.110> want<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.350> have<00:03:27.500> instead<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.100> sign

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
going to want to have instead of sign

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.210 
going to want to have instead of sign
we're<00:03:28.670> gonna<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:29.060> when<00:03:29.240> i<00:03:29.270> have<00:03:29.420> noise<00:03:29.720> and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
we're gonna have when i have noise and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.860 
we're gonna have when i have noise and
change<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.400> direction<00:03:31.550> of<00:03:31.940> 0<00:03:32.240> so<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:32.720> more

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
change the direction of 0 so it's more

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.650 
change the direction of 0 so it's more
like<00:03:33.020> a<00:03:33.050> TV<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.680> fact<00:03:33.890> bring<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.030> height<00:03:35.270> to

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
like a TV in fact bring the height to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.400 
like a TV in fact bring the height to
about<00:03:37.510> well<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.050> middle<00:03:39.170> it's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
about well actually in the middle it's

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.110 
about well actually in the middle it's
going<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.620> be<00:03:39.710> about<00:03:39.800> 50<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.550> can<00:03:40.700> start<00:03:40.970> off

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
going to be about 50 so we can start off

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.570 
going to be about 50 so we can start off
with<00:03:41.270> you<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:42.290> also<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.770> also<00:03:43.010> works<00:03:43.220> with<00:03:43.520> a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
with you and also this also works with a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.170 
with you and also this also works with a
smooth<00:03:44.180> noise<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:45.520> square<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.550> also<00:03:46.970> looks

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
smooth noise and square it also looks

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.510 
smooth noise and square it also looks
pretty<00:03:47.420> cool<00:03:47.660> um<00:03:47.930> i'm<00:03:48.560> not<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> lot<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.250> people

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
pretty cool um i'm not a lot of people

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.040 
pretty cool um i'm not a lot of people
use<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:49.910> square<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:53.690> might<00:03:53.870> need<00:03:53.990> to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
use it with square so you might need to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.710 
use it with square so you might need to
switch<00:03:54.290> around<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.590> numbers<00:03:54.860> 0<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.720> change

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
switch around the numbers 0 so change

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.740 
switch around the numbers 0 so change
the<00:03:56.780> wave<00:03:57.260> speed<00:03:57.440> 22<00:03:57.710> and<00:03:58.160> actually<00:03:59.120> yeah

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the wave speed 22 and actually yeah

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.590 
the wave speed 22 and actually yeah
change<00:04:00.110> too<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> guess<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.850> why<00:04:01.970> we<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.240> that<00:04:02.390> is

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
change too I guess and why we do that is

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.420 
change too I guess and why we do that is
I'll<00:04:02.840> Sharon<00:04:03.260> suck<00:04:04.210> go<00:04:05.210> forward<00:04:06.130> 15<00:04:07.130> frames

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
I'll Sharon suck go forward 15 frames

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.850 
I'll Sharon suck go forward 15 frames
bring<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.420> wave<00:04:08.630> height<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.880> 60<00:04:11.410> go<00:04:12.410> forward

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
bring the wave height to 60 go forward

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.880 
bring the wave height to 60 go forward
another<00:04:13.130> 15<00:04:13.670> frames<00:04:13.970> bring<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.050> back<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.500> zero

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
another 15 frames bring it back to zero

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
another 15 frames bring it back to zero
so<00:04:16.480> what<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.660> wave<00:04:18.130> speed<00:04:19.130> does<00:04:19.520> is<00:04:19.790> that

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
so what the wave speed does is that

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.440 
so what the wave speed does is that
moves<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:21.020> black<00:04:21.710> noise<00:04:22.700> stuff

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
moves the black noise stuff

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.150 
moves the black noise stuff
so<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.870> animates<00:04:25.290> it<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.920> looks<00:04:26.100> really

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
so it animates it and it looks really

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.720 
so it animates it and it looks really
cool<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:27.710> now<00:04:28.710> we've<00:04:29.160> finished<00:04:29.400> with<00:04:29.700> our

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
cool and now we've finished with our

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.280 
cool and now we've finished with our
wave<00:04:30.060> warp<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.540> don't<00:04:30.690> really<00:04:30.810> need<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.170> do

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
wave warp you don't really need to do

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.230 
wave warp you don't really need to do
much<00:04:31.470> else<00:04:31.770> make<00:04:32.640> sure<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:32.910> keep<00:04:33.090> the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
much else make sure you keep the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.380 
much else make sure you keep the
directions<00:04:33.660> your<00:04:33.930> wave<00:04:34.380> with<00:04:34.680> 500<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.700> you

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
directions your wave with 500 and you

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.860 
directions your wave with 500 and you
only<00:04:36.540> keyframe<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.170> height<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.870> noise

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
only keyframe the height and the noise

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.870 
only keyframe the height and the noise
you're<00:04:40.050> good<00:04:40.230> at<00:04:40.380> six<00:04:40.710> just<00:04:41.220> keep<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.550> six

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
you're good at six just keep it six

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.680 
you're good at six just keep it six
looks<00:04:42.330> pretty<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:45.390> don't<00:04:45.450> want<00:04:45.660> to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
looks pretty good and you don't want to

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.320 
looks pretty good and you don't want to
like<00:04:45.900> make<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.140> like<00:04:46.520> 40<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.970> if<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.210> do

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
like make it like 40 because if you do

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.910 
like make it like 40 because if you do
that<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.780> then<00:04:49.080> they<00:04:49.230> just<00:04:49.440> my<00:04:49.590> lady<00:04:49.770> just

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
that and then they just my lady just

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.130 
that and then they just my lady just
pops<00:04:49.980> up<00:04:50.460> like<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.760> don't<00:04:50.940> look<00:04:51.120> too<00:04:51.180> good<00:04:51.450> so

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
pops up like that don't look too good so

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.190 
pops up like that don't look too good so
you<00:04:52.200> want<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.680> keep<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.980> subtle<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:54.200> then

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
you want to keep it subtle and then

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.970 
you want to keep it subtle and then
turbulent<00:04:55.740> displace<00:04:56.070> put<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.430> about<00:04:56.700> 01<00:04:57.980> says

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
turbulent displace put it about 01 says

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.010 
turbulent displace put it about 01 says
that<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> hundred<00:04:59.490> it's<00:04:59.790> all<00:04:59.880> good<00:05:00.180> we're<00:05:00.900> going

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that a hundred it's all good we're going

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.950 
that a hundred it's all good we're going
to<00:05:01.080> keyframe<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.650> evolution<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.430> amount

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
to keyframe the evolution in the amount

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.370 
to keyframe the evolution in the amount
so<00:05:03.960> go<00:05:04.140> forward<00:05:05.120> 15<00:05:06.120> frames<00:05:06.300> again<00:05:06.690> bring<00:05:07.170> them

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
so go forward 15 frames again bring them

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.180 
so go forward 15 frames again bring them
up<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.800> 60<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:09.110> go<00:05:10.110> forward<00:05:10.440> another<00:05:10.710> 15

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
up to the 60 and go forward another 15

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.230 
up to the 60 and go forward another 15
frames<00:05:11.810> bring<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:13.530> Mount<00:05:13.890> 20<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.640> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
frames bring the Mount 20 and the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.470 
frames bring the Mount 20 and the
evolution<00:05:15.750> up<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:17.480> so<00:05:18.480> now<00:05:19.490> I'm<00:05:20.490> trying<00:05:21.240> to

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
evolution up to one so now I'm trying to

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.140 
evolution up to one so now I'm trying to
drag<00:05:21.750> this<00:05:21.870> over<00:05:22.670> so<00:05:23.670> now<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.180> we<00:05:24.210> Ram<00:05:24.960> preview

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
drag this over so now if we Ram preview

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.630 
drag this over so now if we Ram preview
he<00:05:27.150> scopes<00:05:27.510> in<00:05:27.720> he's<00:05:28.050> looking<00:05:28.410> oh<00:05:28.650> baby<00:05:29.490> a

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
he scopes in he's looking oh baby a

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:42.140 
he scopes in he's looking oh baby a
triple<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.480> then<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:36.500> will<00:05:37.500> pop<00:05:37.650> up<00:05:40.850> yeah<00:05:41.850> so

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
triple and then it will pop up yeah so

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.510 
triple and then it will pop up yeah so
we<00:05:42.420> just<00:05:42.660> remade<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.320> effect<00:05:43.680> I'm<00:05:44.010> real

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
we just remade that effect I'm real

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.630 
we just remade that effect I'm real
quick<00:05:44.730> in<00:05:44.910> a<00:05:45.030> couple<00:05:45.270> minutes<00:05:45.390> so<00:05:46.140> um<00:05:46.470> I<00:05:46.830> hope

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
quick in a couple minutes so um I hope

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.880 
quick in a couple minutes so um I hope

about<00:05:54.120> this<00:05:54.450> making<00:05:55.170> cinematics<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:56.010> motion

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
about this making cinematics in motion

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.270 
about this making cinematics in motion
tracks<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:57.390> giving<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.140> you<00:05:58.230> guys<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.680> think

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
tracks and giving it to you guys I think

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.010 
tracks and giving it to you guys I think
I<00:05:59.340> would<00:05:59.460> be<00:05:59.550> something<00:06:00.150> pretty<00:06:00.390> successful

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
I would be something pretty successful

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.520 
I would be something pretty successful
but<00:06:01.200> if<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:02.010> think<00:06:02.070> different<00:06:02.700> just<00:06:03.530> comment

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
but if you think different just comment

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.310 
but if you think different just comment
I<00:06:04.650> guess<00:06:04.980> so<00:06:05.670> uh<00:06:05.700> this<00:06:06.390> has<00:06:06.510> been<00:06:06.600> using<00:06:06.810> IE<00:06:07.020> i

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
I guess so uh this has been using IE i

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.620 
I guess so uh this has been using IE i
hope<00:06:07.500> you<00:06:07.590> guys<00:06:07.680> its<00:06:07.860> turret<00:06:08.250> i<00:06:08.460> hope<00:06:09.330> you<00:06:09.420> guys
