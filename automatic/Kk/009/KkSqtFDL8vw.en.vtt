the<00:02:40.320> iPod<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:41.870> still<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.110> I've<00:02:43.260> said<00:02:43.500> in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the iPod I still and I've said in

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.690 
the iPod I still and I've said in
another<00:02:43.800> video<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> still<00:02:44.580> don't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
another video but I still don't

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.780 
another video but I still don't
recommend<00:02:45.150> using<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.690> EQ<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.250> iPod<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
recommend using the EQ in the iPod to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.320 
recommend using the EQ in the iPod to
boost<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.239> bass<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.840> leave<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> flat<00:02:50.300> when<00:02:51.300> I

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
boost the bass just leave it flat when I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.120 
boost the bass just leave it flat when I
tried<00:02:51.840> boosting<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> base<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.709> tried<00:02:52.950> several

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
tried boosting the base I tried several

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.979 
tried boosting the base I tried several
different<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.610> acoustic<00:02:54.060> setting<00:02:54.360> even<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
different the acoustic setting even and

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.320 
different the acoustic setting even and
jazz<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.180> in<00:02:57.180> my<00:02:57.390> iPod<00:02:57.750> Classic<00:02:58.220> I

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
jazz and all that in my iPod Classic I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.840 
jazz and all that in my iPod Classic I
was<00:03:00.330> getting<00:03:00.660> some<00:03:01.140> bass<00:03:01.860> distortion<00:03:02.130> and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
was getting some bass distortion and

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.449 
was getting some bass distortion and
it's<00:03:03.330> very<00:03:03.540> noticeable<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.260> me<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.680> I'd

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
it's very noticeable to me and I'd

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.060 
it's very noticeable to me and I'd
prefer<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:06.750> has<00:03:06.900> good<00:03:07.140> bass<00:03:07.320> by<00:03:07.560> itself<00:03:07.830> these

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
prefer it has good bass by itself these

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.979 
prefer it has good bass by itself these
are<00:03:08.220> pretty<00:03:08.370> strong<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> bass<00:03:09.090> before<00:03:09.959> I

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
are pretty strong in the bass before I

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.600 
are pretty strong in the bass before I
heard<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.380> mine<00:03:10.500> didn't<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.100> didn't

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
heard of mine didn't think I didn't

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.090 
heard of mine didn't think I didn't
think<00:03:11.670> radios<00:03:12.030> would<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:12.450> would<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.320> very

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
think radios would have would have very

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.030 
think radios would have would have very
deep<00:03:14.340> bass<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:14.820> it's<00:03:15.150> deep<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:16.260> not<00:03:16.620> it's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
deep bass but it's deep it's not it's

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.410 
deep bass but it's deep it's not it's
not<00:03:17.250> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> give<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> impact<00:03:18.209> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
not going to give you the impact and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.620 
not going to give you the impact and
slam<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:19.170> like<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.310> dre<00:03:20.579> beats<00:03:20.610> or<00:03:21.150> something

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
slam of like the dre beats or something

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.390 
slam of like the dre beats or something
but<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:22.170> going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.500> much<00:03:22.680> more<00:03:22.860> accurate

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
but it's going to be much more accurate

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.050 
but it's going to be much more accurate
so<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.810> my<00:03:24.959> recommendation<00:03:25.170> for<00:03:25.829> that

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
so this is my recommendation for that

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750 
so this is my recommendation for that
now<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.690> thing<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.930> note<00:03:28.280> there<00:03:29.280> very<00:03:29.579> light
