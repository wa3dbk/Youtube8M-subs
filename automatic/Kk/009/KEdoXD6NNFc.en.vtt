palm okay if you take a look there's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.520 
palm okay if you take a look there's
actually<00:02:01.880> two<00:02:02.299> stretch<00:02:02.630> zones<00:02:02.960> on<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.229> inside

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
actually two stretch zones on the inside

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.410 
actually two stretch zones on the inside
of<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.770> palm<00:02:03.950> one<00:02:04.189> at<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> base<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.240> thumb

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
of the palm one at the base of the thumb

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.789 
of the palm one at the base of the thumb
one<00:02:05.630> at<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.840> base<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.259> knuckles<00:02:06.619> and

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
one at the base of the knuckles and

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.210 
one at the base of the knuckles and
again<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.909> addresses<00:02:08.329> comfort<00:02:08.689> and<00:02:08.810> feel

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
again that addresses comfort and feel

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.260 
again that addresses comfort and feel
interaction<00:02:10.220> between<00:02:10.549> glove<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:10.939> stick<00:02:11.150> you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
interaction between glove and stick you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.970 
interaction between glove and stick you
really<00:02:11.599> can<00:02:11.750> open<00:02:12.020> your<00:02:12.080> hand<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.620> close

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
really can open your hand you can close

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.460 
really can open your hand you can close
it<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.849> very<00:02:14.150> forgiving<00:02:14.690> with<00:02:15.290> this

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
it it's it's very forgiving with this

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.240 
it it's it's very forgiving with this
type<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.680> design

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
type of design

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.190 
type of design
so<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.670> get<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.850> nice<00:02:17.200> interaction

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
so you really get a nice interaction

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.350 
so you really get a nice interaction
between<00:02:18.620> 12<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:18.920> stick<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.880> definitely<00:02:20.270> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
between 12 and stick and definitely and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240 
between 12 and stick and definitely and
I<00:02:20.540> mean<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.960> guys<00:02:21.080> still<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:22.010> same

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
durability with using you know the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.410 
durability with using you know the
traditional<00:02:24.470> materials<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.460> no<00:02:25.940> base<00:02:26.180> of

the ball exactly we go with a pretty
high<00:02:28.520> profile<00:02:29.000> because<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.300> know<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> butt

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
high profile because you know the butt

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.840 
high profile because you know the butt
end<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.050> stick<00:02:30.290> usually<00:02:31.250> rubs<00:02:31.460> here<00:02:31.670> this

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
end of the stick usually rubs here this

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.120 
end of the stick usually rubs here this
is<00:02:31.940> where<00:02:32.060> gloves<00:02:32.390> tend<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.750> wear<00:02:32.900> prim<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
is where gloves tend to wear prim you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.830 
is where gloves tend to wear prim you
know<00:02:34.220> before<00:02:35.000> anywhere<00:02:35.240> else<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.600> glove

this is you know you guys are one of the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.880 
this is you know you guys are one of the
few<00:02:47.420> manufacturers<00:02:47.900> are<00:02:48.260> having<00:02:48.770> that

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
few manufacturers are having that

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.310 
few manufacturers are having that
feature<00:02:49.120> y/n<00:02:50.120> why'd<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.780> guys<00:02:50.930> go<00:02:51.080> ahead<00:02:51.110> and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
go with that on their club we found that

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.240 
go with that on their club we found that
when<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> consumer<00:02:54.050> puts<00:02:54.500> on<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.800> glove<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
when a consumer puts on the glove the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.979 
when a consumer puts on the glove the
first<00:02:55.459> question<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.270> comfortable<00:02:56.630> if

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
first question is is it comfortable if

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.020 
first question is is it comfortable if
it<00:02:57.350> passes<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.709> comfort<00:02:58.130> test<00:02:58.160> they<00:02:58.760> very

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it passes the comfort test they very

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.729 
it passes the comfort test they very
often<00:02:59.239> kind<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.750> try<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.020> move<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.260> around<00:03:00.350> and

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
often kind of try and move it around and

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.040 
often kind of try and move it around and
they'll<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.340> cuff<00:03:02.180> length<00:03:02.420> becomes<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.840> point

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
they'll the cuff length becomes a point

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.810 
they'll the cuff length becomes a point
of<00:03:03.110> contention<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.770> they<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.520> know<00:03:04.550> it's

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
of contention so they you know it's

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.610 
of contention so they you know it's
either<00:03:05.000> too<00:03:05.060> long<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.660> too<00:03:05.810> short<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.470> we're

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
either too long it's too short so we're

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.440 
either too long it's too short so we're
giving<00:03:06.890> them<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.100> option<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.760> about<00:03:08.060> one<00:03:08.270> inch
