anesthetics you realize it's a bit of a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.150 
anesthetics you realize it's a bit of a
problem<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.840> there's<00:04:45.050> propofol<00:04:45.830> which<00:04:46.040> is

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
problem so there's propofol which is

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.030 
problem so there's propofol which is
fairly<00:04:46.400> complex<00:04:47.620> molecule<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:48.919> the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
fairly complex molecule this is the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.430 
fairly complex molecule this is the
thing<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.250> most<00:04:49.640> this<00:04:50.540> is<00:04:50.720> how<00:04:50.900> anesthesia

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
thing that most this is how anesthesia

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.950 
thing that most this is how anesthesia
is<00:04:51.620> usually<00:04:52.090> induced<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:53.300> what<00:04:53.419> they<00:04:53.540> put<00:04:53.810> in

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
is usually induced it's what they put in

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.930 
is usually induced it's what they put in

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
complex then you've got sodium

which<00:05:03.560> was<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.160> kind<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.460> thing<00:05:04.700> that<00:05:04.730> used<00:05:05.060> to

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
which was the kind of thing that used to

which was the kind of thing that used to
be<00:05:05.390> used<00:05:05.570> before<00:05:05.840> propofol<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.890> it's<00:05:07.010> still

be used before propofol and it's still

administer the chemicals that kill you
it's<00:05:13.400> what<00:05:13.790> they<00:05:13.910> use<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.090> knock<00:05:14.420> you<00:05:14.570> out<00:05:14.630> this

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
it's what they use to knock you out this

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.750 
it's what they use to knock you out this
is<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.530> barbiturate<00:05:15.860> it's<00:05:16.340> even<00:05:16.580> more

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
is a barbiturate it's even more

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.590 
is a barbiturate it's even more
complicated<00:05:16.940> structure<00:05:18.760> chloroform<00:05:19.760> this

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
complicated structure chloroform this

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.300 
complicated structure chloroform this
one's<00:05:20.840> different<00:05:21.050> because<00:05:21.410> it's<00:05:21.560> inhales<00:05:21.950> and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
one's different because it's inhales and

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.990 
one's different because it's inhales and
it's<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.730> lot<00:05:22.880> simpler<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:25.310> you've<00:05:25.460> got<00:05:25.580> Zen<00:05:25.850> on

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
it's a lot simpler and you've got Zen on

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.820 
it's a lot simpler and you've got Zen on
which<00:05:26.300> isn't<00:05:26.570> even<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:26.810> molecule<00:05:27.050> it's<00:05:27.350> an<00:05:27.470> atom

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
which isn't even a molecule it's an atom

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.760 
which isn't even a molecule it's an atom
and<00:05:28.150> again<00:05:29.150> it's<00:05:29.570> inhales<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.320> it<00:05:30.440> triggers

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
and again it's inhales and it triggers

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.690 
and again it's inhales and it triggers
unconsciousness<00:05:31.810> so<00:05:32.810> it's<00:05:33.440> it's<00:05:34.130> kind<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.580> a

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
unconsciousness so it's it's kind of a

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.690 
unconsciousness so it's it's kind of a
mystery<00:05:35.060> how<00:05:35.419> can<00:05:35.660> it<00:05:35.750> be<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:35.960> all<00:05:36.700> these

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
mystery how can it be that all these

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.760 
mystery how can it be that all these
really<00:05:38.090> different<00:05:38.600> molecules<00:05:39.020> can<00:05:39.350> have<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
really different molecules can have the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.280 
really different molecules can have the
same<00:05:39.980> effect<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:41.150> seems<00:05:41.390> unlikely<00:05:41.750> that<00:05:41.930> some

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
same effect it seems unlikely that some

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.190 
same effect it seems unlikely that some
of<00:05:42.410> them<00:05:42.560> which<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.890> large<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:43.310> complex<00:05:43.669> are

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
of them which a large and complex are

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.230 
of them which a large and complex are

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
like them on one idea was that one of

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.840 
like them on one idea was that one of
the<00:05:53.390> one<00:05:53.540> of<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.720> early<00:05:53.930> ideas<00:05:54.230> was<00:05:54.500> that<00:05:54.850> they

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
the one of the early ideas was that they

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.030 
the one of the early ideas was that they
all<00:05:56.120> seemed<00:05:56.510> to<00:05:56.570> dissolve<00:05:56.990> in<00:05:57.230> olive<00:05:57.560> oil<00:05:57.680> so

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
all seemed to dissolve in olive oil so

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.680 
all seemed to dissolve in olive oil so
you<00:05:58.100> know<00:05:58.310> these<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.640> initial<00:05:59.180> tests<00:05:59.450> back<00:05:59.540> in

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
you know these the initial tests back in

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.930 
you know these the initial tests back in
the<00:05:59.780> 1850s<00:06:00.260> they<00:06:00.800> noticed<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.370> these<00:06:01.669> things

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
the 1850s they noticed that these things

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.420 
the 1850s they noticed that these things
all<00:06:02.090> seem<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.330> dissolve<00:06:02.750> in<00:06:02.980> Oliver<00:06:03.980> which<00:06:04.220> led

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
all seem to dissolve in Oliver which led

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.820 
all seem to dissolve in Oliver which led
to<00:06:04.460> this<00:06:04.640> idea<00:06:05.090> that<00:06:05.260> possibly<00:06:06.260> they<00:06:06.770> were

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
to this idea that possibly they were

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.670 
to this idea that possibly they were
doing<00:06:07.820> something<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.720> fatty<00:06:09.080> portion<00:06:09.590> of

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
doing something to the fatty portion of

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.200 
doing something to the fatty portion of
the<00:06:09.770> brain<00:06:09.950> so<00:06:10.310> that<00:06:10.340> some<00:06:10.580> of<00:06:10.669> the<00:06:10.760> bit<00:06:10.970> some

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
the brain so that some of the bit some

the brain so that some of the bit some
of<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.360> brain<00:06:11.540> is<00:06:11.720> quite<00:06:12.020> fatty<00:06:12.290> and<00:06:12.530> oily

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.740 
of the brain is quite fatty and oily
maybe<00:06:13.550> they<00:06:13.760> were<00:06:13.820> dissolving<00:06:14.330> in<00:06:14.479> this<00:06:14.600> bit

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
maybe they were dissolving in this bit

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.630 
maybe they were dissolving in this bit
of<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.900> brain<00:06:15.110> and<00:06:15.380> taking<00:06:16.100> something<00:06:16.370> away

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
of the brain and taking something away

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.570 
of the brain and taking something away
from<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:17.090> brain<00:06:17.300> and<00:06:17.570> causing<00:06:17.990> it's<00:06:18.950> a<00:06:19.160> knock

hypothesis developed and still people
were<00:06:32.060> thinking<00:06:32.210> maybe<00:06:32.419> they're<00:06:32.840> getting<00:06:33.140> into

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
were thinking maybe they're getting into

the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and
they're<00:06:35.419> doing<00:06:35.570> something<00:06:35.930> they're

they're doing something they're

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.990 
they're doing something they're
distorting<00:06:36.919> it<00:06:37.010> somehow<00:06:37.250> so<00:06:37.640> that<00:06:37.669> the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
distorting it somehow so that the

the 1980s and 90s people discovered that

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.940 
the 1980s and 90s people discovered that

actually these things do binds to

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
what conventional drugs do so they don't

distorting them in some way and actually
it's<00:07:07.280> still<00:07:07.460> a<00:07:07.490> bit<00:07:07.669> of<00:07:07.729> a<00:07:07.760> mystery<00:07:08.060> we<00:07:08.270> still

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
it's still a bit of a mystery we still

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.090 
it's still a bit of a mystery we still
don't<00:07:08.690> really<00:07:08.780> understand<00:07:09.440> how<00:07:09.650> it<00:07:09.800> can<00:07:09.919> be

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
don't really understand how it can be

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.920 
don't really understand how it can be
that<00:07:10.310> all<00:07:10.700> the

that all the

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.469 
that all the
things<00:07:11.250> affect<00:07:12.250> a<00:07:12.400> nerve<00:07:12.580> cell<00:07:12.610> firing<00:07:13.270> but

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 
things affect a nerve cell firing but

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.219 
things affect a nerve cell firing but
but<00:07:13.720> they<00:07:13.810> do<00:07:13.990> somehow<00:07:15.720> but<00:07:16.720> molecular

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
but they do somehow but molecular

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.080 
but they do somehow but molecular
mechanisms<00:07:17.710> aside<00:07:18.009> there<00:07:18.310> is<00:07:18.430> perhaps<00:07:18.669> a<00:07:18.940> more

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
mechanisms aside there is perhaps a more

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.990 
mechanisms aside there is perhaps a more
interesting<00:07:19.509> way<00:07:19.900> of<00:07:19.930> thinking<00:07:20.770> about<00:07:21.009> how

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
interesting way of thinking about how

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.879 
interesting way of thinking about how
anesthetics<00:07:22.720> cause<00:07:22.930> unconsciousness<00:07:23.289> and

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
anesthetics cause unconsciousness and

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.800 
anesthetics cause unconsciousness and
that<00:07:24.520> is<00:07:24.669> to<00:07:24.880> think<00:07:25.090> of<00:07:25.210> the<00:07:25.389> whole<00:07:25.539> brain

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
that is to think of the whole brain

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.390 
that is to think of the whole brain
levels<00:07:26.229> of<00:07:26.410> what<00:07:26.560> what<00:07:26.949> are<00:07:27.190> these<00:07:27.340> things

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
levels of what what are these things

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.290 
levels of what what are these things
doing<00:07:27.940> for<00:07:28.060> the<00:07:28.150> brain<00:07:28.360> and<00:07:30.000> how<00:07:31.000> does<00:07:31.060> that

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
doing for the brain and how does that

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.659 
doing for the brain and how does that
differ<00:07:31.720> from<00:07:31.930> normal<00:07:32.289> consciousness<00:07:32.949> me

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:33.669
