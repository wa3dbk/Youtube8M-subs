 authorities who can look at the clothes 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.400
 old 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.140
 skepticism it's a reflection on this 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.750
 she loves the new Hermès face

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.660
 place of life between the tea room the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.610
 library the florist and the la 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 possibility I have the impression in this

 shop to really be able to put in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.240

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.660
 decorative is chaos 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.010
 in fact it's a very very 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.940
 very nice and very beautiful but it's 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.500
 have a big empty 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.790
 so the idea of cause to build to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 inside to make boxes in the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.250
 box 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.080
 it was a way of simulating the house 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.290
 and to make a living room a dining room 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.600
 It was only symbolized by 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.690
 big wooden bubbles so we cross 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.550
 a space then another of a sensation 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.460
 of first in pieces and in this 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.460
 time to stay covered whole 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.350
 mythical to the world to have this true 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.780
