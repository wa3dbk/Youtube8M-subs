00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hello, you are watching the origami channel 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.450
 channel and today we will do here 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.269
 so here 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 crane is done it is not very difficult 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:20.150
 when you do it very well not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 give you difficulties let's get started 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.410
 take a sheet of square paper and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.840
 we combine from it the basic form double 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 square 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.400
 This video we have on the channel if 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.490
 who is interesting to see let's add 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.450
 too. half stinger opposite 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.450
 side of the other 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.200
 reveal we fold the other two 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.200
 opposite side of a friend pod 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.970
 we open the doctors for the other 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.130
 side and fold diagonally blue 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.130
 along the way of finding the angle with each other 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.430
 Now we disclose remove the two other pairs 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.330
 like your angle 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.330
 to each other 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.670
 reveal turn the other side 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.290
 click on the center and fold these two 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.100
 little corner here to this top of the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.100
 clap 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.060
 That turned out to be a basic form of double 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.040
 square 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.050
 double square doctors make the base 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.920
 forum bird 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:04.930
 for this we add these two sides 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.930
 center line on one side 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 and on the other hand 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.939
 then bend the upper triangle on 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.939
 us 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.950
 so that vershinka hit the central 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.610
 open the line open our little corner 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.000
 and now we hold a finger 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.599
 upper triangle and raise this 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.280
 corner up we fold our pages 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.280
 inward in his lenin way 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.690
 do not rush neatly 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.690
 on the one hand and the other 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 align all 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.910
 It turned out such a tiny form 1 Doctors 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.220
 you on the other side and with this country 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.360
 do the same thing we fold our 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.560
 corners of the price here are the sides and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.740
 the center line is waiting for this with one 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.740
 parties 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.379
 and on the other hand 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:42.299
 open finger hold 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.830
 I reveal a triangle 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:49.459
 we fold our side inwards with 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.459
 one side 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.810
 the other side 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.510
 here 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.860
 Received the basic forms of the bird this photo 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.300
 also reviewed in our channel pro 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.250
 body base form then by 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.419
 legs fold each side 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.459
 the price is this side and the center line 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:23.960
 the warrior's math case 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.560
 crooked in Iran in the corner of all with 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.560
 one side 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:43.770
 the other side pervach it on the thing. 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.520
 we go the same third party and with 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.520
 fourth party 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.820
 Here we have a basic bird forum 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.960
 only on the outside of thin legs like then 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.350
 open from this side and fold 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.350
 this part 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.730
 neatly collapsing in the middle 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.810
 and now adjust where so here 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.340
 on this side we do the same 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.870
 open fold inward 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.039
 fold in the middle 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:44.000
 in half and not adjustable as we need 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.000
 So 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.050
 study we will do 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:55.430
 when head and tail 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.699
 let's make this side head 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:04.960
 bend not in your mood with 9 3 4 1 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:06.639
 Chow corner on the side 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.440
 and then 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.440
 revealing 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.610
 this half is similar inside 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.070
 triangles 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.610
 move a little 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:21.270
 now got god exactly now 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.270
 let's open the Crimea 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.610
 one mug 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.429
 such a wing 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:37.930
 open mine 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.930
 straighten legs 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.410
 you got 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.410
 crane 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.539
