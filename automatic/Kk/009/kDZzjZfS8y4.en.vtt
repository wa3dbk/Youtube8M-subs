the evidence base for practice it is
very<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.200> critically

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
very much around how you will critically

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.400 
very much around how you will critically
analyze<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.729> evidence<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
analyze the evidence and then how you

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.889 
analyze the evidence and then how you
might<00:01:31.830> affect<00:01:32.009> change<00:01:32.610> within<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.479> area<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
practice there are opportunities within

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
practice there are opportunities within
both<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.800> second<00:01:38.250> years<00:01:38.580> where

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
both the first and second years where

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.170 
both the first and second years where
you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.630> analyze<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.619> evidence<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:41.520> then

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you can analyze that evidence and then

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
you can analyze that evidence and then
look<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.509> ways<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.990> applying<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:44.280> will

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
look at ways of applying that we will

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.639 
look at ways of applying that we will
undertake<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.910> dissertation<00:01:45.350> where<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> can

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
undertake a dissertation where you can

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.669 
undertake a dissertation where you can
actually<00:01:46.830> write<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> program<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.060> change<00:01:48.679> that

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
actually write a program of change that

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.609 
actually write a program of change that
you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> take<00:01:50.220> back<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:51.240> hospital<00:01:51.990> or

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
you can take back to your hospital or

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.529 
you can take back to your hospital or
community<00:01:53.550> environment<00:01:55.910> so<00:01:56.910> our<00:01:57.060> course<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539
