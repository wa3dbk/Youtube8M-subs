done<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.270> can<00:01:13.390> gain<00:01:13.540> enough<00:01:13.810> speed<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.410> jump<00:01:15.370> a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
done you can gain enough speed to jump a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.740 
done you can gain enough speed to jump a
gap<00:01:15.610> like<00:01:15.640> this<00:01:15.940> are<00:01:16.120> probably<00:01:16.390> even<00:01:16.480> longer

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
gap like this are probably even longer

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.190 
gap like this are probably even longer
for<00:01:17.760> intermediate<00:01:18.760> riders<00:01:19.060> they<00:01:19.300> can't<00:01:19.660> jump

as well aim for expert riders if you can

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.630 
as well aim for expert riders if you can
do<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.410> correctly<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:23.920> much<00:01:24.100> faster<00:01:24.310> than

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
do it correctly it's much faster than

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
do it correctly it's much faster than
jumping<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.120> want<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.390> roll<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.630> jump<00:01:25.990> so

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
jumping you want to roll the jump so

jumping you want to roll the jump so
when<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:26.950> approach<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.520> jump<00:01:27.760> we<00:01:28.330> stay<00:01:28.540> loose

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
when you approach the jump we stay loose

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.540 
when you approach the jump we stay loose
around<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.470> middle<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.070> know<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.220> center<00:01:30.520> of

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and you can't get a good pump so you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.640

the<00:02:57.930> speed<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.470> launch<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.920> next<00:02:59.130> one's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the speed to launch the next one's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400 
the speed to launch the next one's
movement<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.630> particular<00:03:00.840> course

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
movement and for this particular course

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.830 
movement and for this particular course
there's<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.489> corner<00:03:02.819> right<00:03:02.970> there<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.360> 180

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
there's a corner right there it's 180

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.330 
there's a corner right there it's 180
degrees<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.230> flat<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.860> you're<00:03:05.040> pretty<00:03:05.220> much

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
degrees and flat so you're pretty much

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.729 
degrees and flat so you're pretty much
coming<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.849> stop<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:06.959> starting<00:03:07.440> again

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
coming to a stop and then starting again

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.400 
coming to a stop and then starting again
so<00:03:08.370> I'm<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.239> kind<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.600> straight<00:03:09.840> away<00:03:10.050> you're

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
so I'm this kind of straight away you're

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.780 
so I'm this kind of straight away you're
gonna<00:03:10.500> want<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:10.830> much<00:03:11.040> speed<00:03:11.310> as<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.520> can

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
gonna want as much speed as you can

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.970 
gonna want as much speed as you can
coming<00:03:12.209> into<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.510> chain<00:03:13.200> carry<00:03:13.590> swinging

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
coming into it chain carry swinging

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.210 
coming into it chain carry swinging
through<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.250> finish<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.700> not<00:03:14.850> get<00:03:15.030> past<00:03:15.209> so

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
through the finish and not get past so

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.160 
through the finish and not get past so
the<00:03:17.220> professional<00:03:17.819> technique<00:03:18.180> would<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.080> to

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
the professional technique would be to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.470 
the professional technique would be to
come<00:03:19.380> through<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.650> turn<00:03:19.920> start<00:03:20.910> pedaling<00:03:21.060> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
come through the turn start pedaling and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.690 
come through the turn start pedaling and
then<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> few<00:03:22.050> feet<00:03:22.230> before<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.650> jump<00:03:22.860> get<00:03:23.459> into

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
then a few feet before the jump get into

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.000 
then a few feet before the jump get into
a<00:03:23.730> little<00:03:23.880> bit<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.269> pedo<00:03:24.810> wheelie<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.410> be

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
a little bit of a pedo wheelie and be

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.100 
a little bit of a pedo wheelie and be
able<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.430> continue<00:03:26.850> pedaling<00:03:27.390> all<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.019> way

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
able to continue pedaling all the way

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.110 
able to continue pedaling all the way
through<00:03:28.440> until<00:03:29.100> here<00:03:29.519> when<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.850> set<00:03:30.090> your

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
through until here when you set your

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.300 
through until here when you set your
tire<00:03:30.480> down<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.019> then<00:03:31.380> manual<00:03:31.769> out<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.160> way

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
tire down and then manual out that way

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.789 
tire down and then manual out that way
you've<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.150> gotten<00:03:33.720> another<00:03:34.140> three<00:03:34.500> petals

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
you've just gotten another three petals

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.860 
you've just gotten another three petals
into<00:03:35.040> your<00:03:35.340> competitor<00:03:35.850> he'll<00:03:36.299> probably<00:03:36.480> stop

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
into your competitor he'll probably stop

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.990 
into your competitor he'll probably stop
pedaling<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.350> few<00:03:37.560> feet<00:03:37.739> before<00:03:37.920> here<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.519> he's
