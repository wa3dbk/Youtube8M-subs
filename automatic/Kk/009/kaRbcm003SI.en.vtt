 [Music] 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.080
 the 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:18.710
 [Music]

 Alberto special will listen 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.760
 will be of the same place in the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.500
 transportation 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.530
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.270
 cut our strawberries dates 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.100
 we are going to cut in the pictures 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.100
 We are going to place them in a mold 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.330
 [Music] 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.429
 [Music] 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.690
 once we have our strawberries 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.860
 chopped what we are going to do is add 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.510
 the lemon juice 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.129
 of a lemon is fine 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.269
 and this we are going to do so that the 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.269
 express loose in your juice 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.810
 and we are going to add 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.790
 3 a third cup of sugar and the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.650
 let's let it rest 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.740
 well the next thing with being is going to be 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.920
 place the eggs in the blender 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.920
 [Music] 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.179
 two cups of flour for jÃ³ 3 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.369
 Y 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.270
 let's add a little vanilla 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.270
 approximately one tablespoon 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.919
 [Music] 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.900
 and we are going to add a banana 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.630
 [Music] 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.260
 we are going to take to liquefy and what 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.150
 We put in a good mold once 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.620
 we die all the ingredients that 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.660
 we incorporate to the blender we are left to 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.330
 mix in this way that is very 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.950
 similar to what it is for the flower case 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.850
 now let's add some strawberries 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.520
 chopped well now in a pan we're going to 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.910
 melt a little butter just 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.910
 a little 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.570
 and we're going to put it here hot a little 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.380
 and we're going to add our mix as if 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.380
 let's make hot cakes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.519
 and 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.060
 [Music] 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.129
 well we know that our hot cakes are 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.599
 when I 'm already coming back in this way 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.599
 and we are going to flip it 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.760
 as you see is a different way of 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.530
 do the hot cakes I hope you like it 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.330
 well the strawberries that we had put with 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.120
 sugar and a little lemon released their 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.660
 juice as you can see now let's 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.660
 liquefy 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.420
 well we were moved in this way I 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.580
 leave some strawberries to make it 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.260
 like jam style now what are we going 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.420
 to do is place our hot cakes 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.970
 you can place one or two that you 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.270
 you want and you're going to put a little bit of this 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.270
 sauce 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.830
 and I want to take 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:17.500
