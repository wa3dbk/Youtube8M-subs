first<00:00:06.600> thing<00:00:06.839> we'll<00:00:07.049> try<00:00:07.379> as<00:00:07.649> an<00:00:08.069> orchid<00:00:08.460> it's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
first thing we'll try as an orchid it's

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.669 
first thing we'll try as an orchid it's
a<00:00:09.389> little<00:00:09.630> simpler<00:00:09.990> than<00:00:10.170> motion<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.650> have

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
a little simpler than motion you have

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.910 
a little simpler than motion you have
five<00:00:11.070> petals<00:00:11.700> usually<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.300> these<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.809> kind<00:00:13.799> of

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
five petals usually on these I kind of

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.450 
five petals usually on these I kind of
have<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.690> their<00:00:15.690> own<00:00:15.719> shape<00:00:20.600> think<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.840> them

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
have a their own shape think about them

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.040 
have a their own shape think about them
they<00:00:23.460> also<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> stamen<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.960> comes<00:00:25.260> out

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
they also have a stamen that comes out

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:37.550 
they also have a stamen that comes out
kind<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.230> steps<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:29.130> on

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.420 

come<00:00:38.130> back<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
come back and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.150 
come back and
delineate<00:00:41.360> each<00:00:41.570> different<00:00:42.110> petals<00:00:42.649> remember

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
delineate each different petals remember

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.110 
delineate each different petals remember
it's<00:00:43.280> five-o<00:00:45.100> with<00:00:46.100> kind<00:00:46.370> of<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.520> crease<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:46.879> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
it's five-o with kind of a crease in the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.490 
it's five-o with kind of a crease in the
center

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.130 

and<00:00:51.610> there<00:00:52.610> are<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> million<00:00:53.090> ways<00:00:53.240> to<00:00:53.390> simplify

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
and there are a million ways to simplify

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.990 
and there are a million ways to simplify
these<00:00:54.200> things<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:56.210> this<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.630> little<00:00:58.000> more

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
these things and this is a little more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.140 
these things and this is a little more
detail<00:00:59.540> but<00:00:59.950> probably<00:01:00.950> you<00:01:01.070> need<00:01:02.860> okay<00:01:04.150> now

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
detail but probably you need okay now

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.320 
detail but probably you need okay now
with<00:01:05.330> its<00:01:05.540> pedals<00:01:05.960> my<00:01:06.860> or<00:01:07.040> its<00:01:07.220> leaves<00:01:07.910> might

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
with its pedals my or its leaves might

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.310 
with its pedals my or its leaves might
come<00:01:08.570> out<00:01:08.720> sides<00:01:09.110> like<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:11.020> darken<00:01:12.020> them<00:01:12.170> up

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
come out sides like that darken them up

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.840 
come out sides like that darken them up
a<00:01:12.440> little<00:01:12.560> bit<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.010> distinguish<00:01:13.610> them<00:01:13.820> from

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
a little bit to distinguish them from

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.280 
a little bit to distinguish them from
the<00:01:14.119> flower<00:01:15.610> itself<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.630> another<00:01:17.840> one<00:01:18.080> might

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
the flower itself and another one might

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.680 
the flower itself and another one might
be<00:01:18.320> some<00:01:18.800> little<00:01:19.010> exotics<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:20.330> can<00:01:20.510> get

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
be some little exotics and you can get

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:30.370 
be some little exotics and you can get
those<00:01:21.369> I'm<00:01:22.369> doing<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.640> little<00:01:22.759> starbursts

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.460 

almost<00:01:32.020> like<00:01:33.020> little<00:01:35.770> stars<00:01:36.770> there<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:39.350> you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
almost like little stars there and you

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.859 
almost like little stars there and you
can<00:01:39.650> bring<00:01:39.920> their<00:01:40.549> petals<00:01:40.850> down<00:01:41.270> into<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
can bring their petals down into the

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.480 
can bring their petals down into the
same<00:01:42.409> location<00:01:42.680> are<00:01:43.340> their<00:01:43.520> stems<00:01:44.090> excuse<00:01:44.869> me

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
same location are their stems excuse me

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.030 
same location are their stems excuse me
going<00:01:46.490> down<00:01:46.640> here<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.149> same<00:01:47.450> point<00:01:48.040> and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
going down here to the same point and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.940 
going down here to the same point and
you<00:01:49.220> get<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.549> look<00:01:50.530> alright<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
you get that look alright and then the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.600 
you get that look alright and then the
last<00:01:52.670> one<00:01:52.940> will<00:01:53.090> probably<00:01:53.299> try<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.130> bird<00:01:55.460> of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
last one will probably try as a bird of

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.050 
last one will probably try as a bird of
paradise<00:01:56.979> which<00:01:57.979> has<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.250> stem<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.820> kind<00:01:59.000> of

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
paradise which has a stem that kind of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.059 
paradise which has a stem that kind of
comes<00:01:59.299> in<00:01:59.509> from<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.780> side<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:02.710> then<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.830> has<00:02:04.039> a

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
comes in from the side and then it has a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.540 
comes in from the side and then it has a
yeah

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.249 

the<00:02:07.550> color<00:02:07.850> part<00:02:08.239> actually<00:02:08.600> comes<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:09.110> the

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
the color part actually comes out the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.759 
the color part actually comes out the
middle<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.810> guy<00:02:11.989> actually<00:02:12.380> comes<00:02:12.590> out<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
middle this guy actually comes out a

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.500 
middle this guy actually comes out a
little<00:02:12.890> farther<00:02:14.860> these<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.910> sides<00:02:17.209> are

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
little farther these on the sides are

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.580 
little farther these on the sides are
actually<00:02:17.840> leaves

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.750 

whereas<00:02:23.340> these<00:02:23.550> are<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.819> colored<00:02:25.640> part<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
whereas these are the colored part of

whereas these are the colored part of
this<00:02:26.849> one

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.620 

okay

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.910 

that<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.990> from<00:02:40.990> there

that what we get from there

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.960 
that what we get from there
and<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:43.580> how<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.790> draw<00:02:44.030> exotic<00:02:44.600> flowers
