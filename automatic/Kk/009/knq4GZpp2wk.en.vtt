00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.430
 I never installed it but space then 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.880

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.229
 download and download the app y 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.320
 the pulls the compressed rows then you can 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 bring it to the desktop like I did 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.270
 then first of all 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.140
 we open the porsche garden e 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.119
 we do in style install customers 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.119
 snapshots we do ok 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.970
 yes ok we have successfully installed 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:36.070

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:45.120
 minecraft 26 to see we do new 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:50.940
 profil and choose place 1.6.4 hands 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.940
 this one here if we do you are really the 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:06.670
 play and now there will be a brief 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:08.500
 heating of the fort not already done ok 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.850
 as you see we have installed strong in 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.350
 this way I thought I should 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.720
 we already have them installed 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.300
 install only who is true we have it 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.180
 first installed the jerks but still 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.240
 we have installed gates close 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.959
 minecraft now we go to smart 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:31.959
 let's write a hundred percent date 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:36.010
 let's go on the roaming folder then on the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.500
 never acute between acute folder we seek the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.360
 folder mgr 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.930
 where is the mon folder, so here it is 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.810
 you have created the feature I caducato 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.410
 if you have it eliminated anyway in the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:58.209
 mods folder let's drag our file 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.500
 compressed the pixel and move it here 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:06.280
 in the dead folder and then you can 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 in short, put 20 programs with a rush 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.019
