 the can is filled with cherries and which will 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.720

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.120
 which will 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.120
 Cecil 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.000
 winter uses such

 chisinau 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.510
 just tamping because 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.269
 what else 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.510
 pop 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.420
 put the pan 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.420
 100 to 1 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.300
 degrees away or 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.170
 further to minus 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:48.520
 they should then not walk around the city 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:51.150
 but we covered the cover put it beetle 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.150
 or what 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.540
 wasp 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.180
 dome 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.989
 fountains 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.989
 on it before sterilization 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.890
 adjuster 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.170
 hot 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.160
 my mind 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.530
 here you can 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.860
 banks 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.120
 I came to this question now 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.120
 close the handle 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.020
 we break half a turn 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.020
 subtle will give implementation will end 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.340
 and cool 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.340
 until 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.120
 open up 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.980
 2 which are used in a vicious circle 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.180
 we don't close them either 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.490
 by just covering up 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.890
 in order to 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.400
 got out 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.400
 too much 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.620
 okay all the berries are forgiven 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.800
 so mean 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.150
 we have a jar floor 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.150
 touched 4 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.990
 can 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.099
 start a presentation 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.909
 but soak up 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.909
 that is, you are up to it 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.160
 7 and tear off our cover that have become 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.230
 open our pan 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.730
 lid 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.730
 it was materialize eternal sleep 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.350
 shut down 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.550
 mugs 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.490
 since this product should be good 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.770
 warm up should be covered 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.810
 1 bank 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.810
 for better conservation winter 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.970
 can be stored without calories 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.790
 So 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.790
 today is over 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.610
 there is 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.470
 she banks 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.660
 after the hook rumble 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.660
 check the quality of cleaning 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.630
 juice that does not form should 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.650
 flow 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.650
 from under the covers 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.420
 one 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.420
 to scientists 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.760
 so leave them 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.120
 cool in the air 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.510
 our cherry on 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.630
 seed because 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.630
 this
