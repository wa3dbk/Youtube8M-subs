what I did first was I sliced up some

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.730 
what I did first was I sliced up some
cucumbers<00:00:07.830> into<00:00:08.550> thin<00:00:08.760> strips<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.740> if

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
cucumbers into thin strips like this if

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.049 
cucumbers into thin strips like this if
you<00:00:10.920> don't<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> do<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.849> you

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
can cut it any way you want but I like

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
can cut it any way you want but I like
to<00:00:13.920> approximate<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> shreds<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> crab

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
to approximate the shreds of the crab

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.330 
to approximate the shreds of the crab
and<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> type<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.560> cucumber<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and this is the type of cucumber that I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.800 
and this is the type of cucumber that I
used<00:00:17.550> again<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.270> use<00:00:18.420> any<00:00:18.570> other<00:00:18.660> kind

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
used again you can use any other kind

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.390 
used again you can use any other kind
but<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.380> don't<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.740> seeds<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> they're

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
but these don't have seeds and they're

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.740 
but these don't have seeds and they're
about<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.789> right<00:00:20.820> size<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.480> me

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
about the right size for me

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
about the right size for me
you<00:00:22.199> could<00:00:22.350> also<00:00:22.500> peel<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> cucumber<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.550 
you could also peel the cucumber if you
want<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.359> decided<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.930> leave<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> skin<00:00:25.529> on

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
then I'm going to use a Japanese

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.840 
then I'm going to use a Japanese
mayonnaise

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
mayonnaise

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
mayonnaise
it's<00:01:14.850> called<00:01:15.420> QP<00:01:15.869> I'll<00:01:16.049> show<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> package

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's called QP I'll show you the package

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.490 
it's called QP I'll show you the package
in<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> second<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.689> package<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in a second this is the package that it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
in a second this is the package that it
comes<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.490> shaped<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.030> teardrop

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
comes in and it's shaped like a teardrop

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
comes in and it's shaped like a teardrop
sort<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> could<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.400> regular<00:01:23.610> mayonnaise

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
sort of you could use regular mayonnaise

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
sort of you could use regular mayonnaise
but<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> Japanese<00:01:25.290> mayonnaise<00:01:25.500> works<00:01:25.890> better

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
but the Japanese mayonnaise works better

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
but the Japanese mayonnaise works better
in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.340> salad<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> add

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in the salad I think so I'm going to add

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.410 
in the salad I think so I'm going to add
some<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.009> taste<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.270> as

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
some to taste you know you can go as

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
some to taste you know you can go as
heavy<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.720> light<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.860> I'll

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
heavy or light as you like and then I'll

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:32.950 
heavy or light as you like and then I'll
show<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> next<00:01:32.520> step

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
show you the next step

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
show you the next step
so<00:01:33.960> once<00:01:34.110> you've<00:01:34.290> added<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.619> mayonnaise<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so once you've added your mayonnaise and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.010 
so once you've added your mayonnaise and
I've<00:01:35.520> added<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:36.390> about<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> quarter<00:01:36.840> cup

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I've added probably about a quarter cup
