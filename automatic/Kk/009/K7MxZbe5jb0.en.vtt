00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.070
 you already have sleepless nights and there 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.480
 of course, 12 turn cool now 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 then whistle then sing and sing 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 not too early and not the other 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.640
 to step on the feet 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 I say so I have mine 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.220
 have narrowed ass cheeks now 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 only by the number shows what he 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.410
 can and team spirit was very important 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 you have not come your own 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.870
 ding but must be synchronous as 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 Order very well I believe that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.670
 becomes the new boyband of the future 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 we were trained by dancing 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 mr. de point soest and raphael so 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 did it all right and now too 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.380
 to look forward again, whether or not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.860
 and the two made the effort 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 and really he misses the grill 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.939
 study begins at detlef dee soost 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.890
 of course hard authoritarian and us 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.330
 attacked and that would be me 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.680
 Dancing taught and that did not work 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
 i never thought and one works 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.670
 Berlin dialect for free has been going on 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.670
 and how moved you were 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.090
 and that went well 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.140
 this is a completely new novelty for 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.729
 me that I am under one 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.710
 choreographers must move and continue 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.549
 itself and always comes a little bit 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.170
 know better 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.310
 the movement was here for us today 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 bring that was great 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.390
 should be a mix out as a 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:14.440
 a bit amateurish but also quite 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:16.030
 to pro league dancing us because really that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.920
 ran that we were schooling 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:32.190
 sweat ran us the body the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:34.570
 this time a real effort only gave 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.640
 instructions that had to be followed 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:43.000
 otherwise there would be a strange 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:46.600
 atmosphere in the whole room a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.740
 problem with the rotation but now can 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.150
 I turn off the turn she is over 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.170
 she is done and she is as 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.170
 Rotation so not recognizable 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.440
 but it's okay it's gsm I'm glad 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.440
 the way 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.230
 st 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.409
 we trained very hard that's right 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 really because we are all no dancers 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.670
 and photographs mankell itself is it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.260
 really the highest level in the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.760
 Entertainment will be us too 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.959
 so far that we all now 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.250
 in the sleep I can and I do 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.110
 So do not worry that will happen to everyone 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.590
 case work and will be nice silly 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.970
 look and you may be curious if 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.930
 We'll cut it short in such a way 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.319
 Somehow they are panting over the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.319
 island hopping 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.599
 so
