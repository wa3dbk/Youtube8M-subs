00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.849
 hi all guys are zodiacs and well 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.799
 found on our channel today we are 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.449
 here with a really crazy double mob 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.090
 made by interested people has been 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.400
 performed in team deathmatch with use 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.690
 you are then seeing his companions 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.610
 I leave the team to that 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.490
 playing with the shield he was approving 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.650
 the triple pump shotgun mob in team 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.630
 deathmatch which however failed 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.559
 also because it is really very difficult that 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.239
 it would have never been seen has not gone out is 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.769
 output this double c we discussed 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.839
 a little blessed they are loaded which is 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.120
 very nice also because the second one 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.949
 moab is done in 97 seconds on a team 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.409
 pump shotgun deathmatch 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.329
 ok that we leave to kill but not seen 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.339
 they are quite random you have a rifle 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.019
 a pump so you can only kill from 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.760
 close because from a distance and then the pump 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.530
 it doesn't get there and so we have it 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.170
 rated with a lot of gameplay 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.089
 good and to vary a little I think can 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.109
 pure pleasure you leave us written 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.360
 in the comments 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.690
 and in case we bring others or if not 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.700
 like we don't do that anymore 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.500
 I believe in the game I said all for 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.990
 I don't know the class after I will tell you that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.330
 the why left written in the comments 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.580
 if you want to know it and will tell you why 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.430
 then he is not here to comment with me 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.200
 market always my fault because I in 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.150
 I do n't know if you 're hearing this time 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.250
 also from the voice I am very in a hurry 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.080
 I don't have much time so I can't 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.120
 organize them with another to make a 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.120
 commentaries is all because we lose ourselves 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.750
 enough time so I was n't in 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.430
 this period as I have already said and am 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.780
 forced to do so I am sorry for me 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.050
 sorry for yesterday that we don't have 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.700
 loaded the top five is because he didn't have 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.750
 own more time guys in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.300
 latter period 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.970
 it will be so unfortunately you have in Switzerland 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.280
 then school ends my 18 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.620
 June will end this week 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 maybe not the next the most and then 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.360
 I'm still very drawn then anyway 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.130
 school stops at a week e 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.510
 then I leave for three weeks in a row 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.250
 so however also in that 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.070
 week I will have to try to prepare the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.229
 video for how much 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.590
 he was on vacation when I'm on vacation if 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.880
 used etc. so I will be enough 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.350
 stressed maybe you'll see that in play 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.500
 maybe a little shorter and not too short 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.930
 long and maybe you'll hear the single 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 talk to me or another and not so much more 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.270
 dual commentaries as we did so much 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.090
 long ago of the author of the game and with 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.030
 me, however, will return later 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.380
 I hope you are happy for it anyway 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.060
 the gameplay we're bringing you 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.860
 anyway we are always looking for 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
 keep a rough one a day though me 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.959
 I'm really stressed and nothing 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.930
 this was a bit all that 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.090
 It regards the gameplay is all 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.310
 what turned around and mine 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.380
 time issues but now 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 I wanted to know study for a moment the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.060
 ears because it's really important 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.950
 if you are interested in the zodiac series and says 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.440
 I don't know how many will remember it 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.260
 I had already done two or three Mafai episodes 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.950
 the market is a triptych a year ago 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.930
 the series a long time ago and I wanted 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.140
 start it but I need 17 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.970
 so participants and would like to fix 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.519
 a date the game that will obviously be 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.530
 of co2 is however I would like to know if you are 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.470
 interested leave a paper on 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.340
 comments and only guys playing on 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.650
 xbox that have headphones of course 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.360
 because there will also be questions if 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.209
 you don't know what I'm talking about 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.840
 freeze zodiac art pussy thing 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.519
 gender 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.250
 find the series understand what it is 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.900
 treats that I would like to propose again so I have to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.250
 know if you will be there if you are 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.680
 interested, etc. 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.440
 I'm not saying dates like this because I have to 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.820
 see if you are there or not then sell it 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.769
 written in the comments 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.010
 and we will organize ourselves also because I believe 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.200
 both a really fun series and 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.329
 however it involves you so it can be 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.450
 a nice thing also because it can vary 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.760
 a bit from the usual gameplay is something that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.989
 we all go together 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.269
 no gameplay is coming to an end 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.910

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.380
