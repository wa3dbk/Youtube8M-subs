do not hold the iron down press and lift
like<00:01:14.000> this

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.430 

we<00:01:16.730> are<00:01:16.880> careful<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.690> this<00:01:17.840> edge<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.320> the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
we are careful so that this edge of the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.940 
we are careful so that this edge of the
fabric<00:01:18.680> remains<00:01:19.340> straight

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.280 

we<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.939> three<00:01:27.299> times<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.900> create<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
we do this three times to create a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.140 
we do this three times to create a
strong<00:01:28.710> bond

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.030 

you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.730 

now<00:01:39.700> we<00:01:39.760> want<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.180> fuse<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.780> interfacing<00:01:41.590> on

now we want to fuse the interfacing on

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.580 
now we want to fuse the interfacing on
the<00:01:41.950> abutted<00:01:42.400> slit<00:01:42.810> first<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.990> clip<00:01:44.230> a<00:01:44.260> notch

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
the abutted slit first we clip a notch

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.770 
the abutted slit first we clip a notch
here<00:01:45.160> so<00:01:45.910> that<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.240> know<00:01:46.420> where<00:01:46.630> the

here so that we know where the
interfacing<00:01:47.560> will<00:01:47.710> go

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.840 

now<00:01:57.170> remove<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.740> pattern<00:01:57.950> from<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.610> fabric

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
now remove the pattern from the fabric

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.510 
now remove the pattern from the fabric
mark<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.930> wrong<00:02:00.140> side<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.710> our<00:02:00.830> fabric<00:02:01.070> on

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
mark the wrong side of our fabric on

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.030 
mark the wrong side of our fabric on
this<00:02:01.729> side

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
