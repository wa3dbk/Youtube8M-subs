it's<00:02:56.120> nice<00:02:56.359> hand<00:02:56.690> roll<00:02:56.930> form<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.859> up

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.140 

as<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.739> goes<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.640> making<00:03:05.060> nice<00:03:05.680> circles

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
as it goes just at making nice circles

once<00:03:08.150> all<00:03:08.299> your<00:03:08.329> pops<00:03:08.750> are<00:03:08.989> rolled<00:03:09.260> cover<00:03:10.189> it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
once all your pops are rolled cover it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.869 
once all your pops are rolled cover it
with<00:03:10.549> your<00:03:10.819> wax<00:03:11.540> paper<00:03:11.750> put<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:12.439> in<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> fridge

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
with your wax paper put it in the fridge

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.390 
with your wax paper put it in the fridge
sometimes<00:03:14.719> the<00:03:14.930> bottoms<00:03:15.349> will<00:03:15.769> compress<00:03:16.340> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
sometimes the bottoms will compress a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.250 
sometimes the bottoms will compress a
little<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.000> by<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.209> weight<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.109> is

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
little just by the weight and this is

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.470 
little just by the weight and this is
what<00:03:18.439> I<00:03:18.469> usually<00:03:18.920> use<00:03:19.129> for<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.939> bottoms<00:03:20.299> of

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
what I usually use for the bottoms of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.440 
what I usually use for the bottoms of
the<00:03:20.599> cake<00:03:20.780> pops<00:03:21.019> where<00:03:21.260> I'll<00:03:21.379> stick<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.450> stick

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
the cake pops where I'll stick the stick

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.750 
the cake pops where I'll stick the stick
into<00:03:23.810> them<00:03:23.930> anyway<00:03:24.349> so<00:03:24.379> doesn't<00:03:25.280> really<00:03:25.430> make

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
into them anyway so doesn't really make

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.119 
into them anyway so doesn't really make
much<00:03:25.909> of<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.150> difference<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.799> that's<00:03:27.950> how<00:03:28.099> I

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
much of a difference and that's how I

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.280 
much of a difference and that's how I
make<00:03:28.370> my<00:03:28.579> cake<00:03:28.760> pops<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.359> hope<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:29.989> helps

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
make my cake pops I hope that helps

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.950 
make my cake pops I hope that helps
