00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 richard oh see for each is the newest 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 acquisition of ajax 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.860
 the 17-year-old attacker signed one 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.470
 contract for 3 years 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 sikowitz comes across from fc groningen where 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.700
 he already dismantled the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.199
 Every summer he makes the switch to 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.940
 Amsterdam 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.279
 because i like the ajax and it says too 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.279
 my top club was certainly in the netherlands 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 then I want to prove and I that this one 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.550
 good step is one 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
 my career and consciously that was over 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.160
 to stay within the Netherlands 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.650
 Certainly just not abroad 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 million than that I live do not choose 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.620
 then you might be alone 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.440
 retribution financially 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 yes i would sport a very good clean 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.299
 club certainly a step forward 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.449
 sikowitz has been known as 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.190
 great talent and ajax followed the striker 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.140
 for a long time he pointed the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 Dutch champion two years ago 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 then I still had nothing I was 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.210
 just a youth player then we have 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 another honor his debut in first 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 made and the cetera et cetera 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.799
 and now you'll have different inside 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 Experience taken from the FC 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.149
 Groningen what is the 7th st ge 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.579
 played a game and come differently 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.119
 inside of such a large club 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.119
 conscious choice 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.280
 the most important quality of peak 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.830
 of course that you score goals and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.230
 that that controls that will come but now 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.440
 of course another step another 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.670
 image is a higher color large club 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.300
 sees an important phase of you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.090
 career 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.820
 so frame starts the real thing 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.950
 maybe next year only then he must 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.590
 prove himself but of course he has 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.330
 it to make goals 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.490
 she wants me to play is just mostly 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.870
 model of opponent in you must often 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.979
 in the six and I am just a striker who just 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.110
 sixteenth 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.990
 they can and will be made important 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.830
 can be important for the team and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.140
 so important for that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 when we look at the past 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.979
 ajax never really had a striker like that for years 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.690
 the film makes the last players then 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.119
 say 25 30 I do it in season 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.000
 their were too long and amares am 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.410
 you play that it can become that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.660
 then certainly i have faith in it and me 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.480
 t is now going to come good 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.400
 So I entered the next thing is your 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.260
 achieve goals 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.880
 but a start first really not yet 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.940
 really set a goal because the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.400
 customize natural together wish 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.660
 so just agree yes try everything 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.310
 to address this and as much as possible 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.100
 play 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.230
 as much son as possible important 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.090
 are for team to what extent you can already 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.380
 say i'm the number 9 from it 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.030
 start of the season 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.470
 then you can say something else i'm fine 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.959
 competitors between 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.570
 such a feeling the battle and hope you 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.340
 must also give him time and that is 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.700
 perhaps the most important will if 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.130
 you are 17 18 then you should not have one 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.470
 create a large expectation pattern and 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.459
 give him time to calm down 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.840
 develop 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.640
 you know your shirt there were none 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.049
 number on a blog number by you please 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.870
 what comes up 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.510
 thirty flying I can say 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.250
 thirty was my site like i have 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.989
 rockanje just have a nines and 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.910
 of course one by one 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.750
 first switch so we have to go there 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.430
 working 9 give sure of course pressure 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.560
 i hope i can draw my 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.150
 sikowitz you have the opportunity and on 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.650
 to get yes that root of direction 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.640
 changed world with your defense 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.890
 is of course a fantastic stadium 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.450
 beautiful field and 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.030
 and if i just stand for this next to me 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.280
 nice club i used to be from little ones 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 us can likes and sleek and beautiful 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.850
 from the show 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.370
 click on the against ajax is ajax 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.150
 of course a great history 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.340
 and for the rest still 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.980
 title candidates this year probably 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.770
 so just champion for the rest 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.370
 tori is a beautiful club 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.600
 supporters and look forward to it 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.610
 to be part of it 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.209
 I hope so from next season 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.160
 Then I hope I am off 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.160
 until then he will focus entirely on it 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.390
 FC Groningen and at school than 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.950
 just great investment for 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.140
 housing market season from time to time 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.880
 can like they try every match 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.980
 and school must have diploma 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.340
 pick up and then I can too 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.900
 never actually a make-up and for the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.820
 rest just focus on 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.490
 groningen at school and i know after the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.890
 focus entirely on a house that summer 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.890
 certainly also to put it 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.670
 high places like that 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.390
 most over the past because from the middle
