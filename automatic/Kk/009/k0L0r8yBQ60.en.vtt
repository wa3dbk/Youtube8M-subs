00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
green Brian head and it looks a little

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.920 
green Brian head and it looks a little
crooked<00:00:32.700> because<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> heads<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:33.719> bit

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
crooked because the heads a little bit

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.319 
crooked because the heads a little bit
crooked<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.559> smoking<00:00:35.520> shacks<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.969> tried<00:00:36.210> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
crooked from smoking shacks I tried to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
crooked from smoking shacks I tried to
straighten<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:36.960> best<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.380> could<00:00:37.440> but

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
straighten it out as best as I could but

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
straighten it out as best as I could but
uh<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.600> simple<00:00:39.930> defensive<00:00:40.680> had

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
uh it's a really simple defensive had

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240 
uh it's a really simple defensive had
that<00:00:41.850> mid<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> low<00:00:42.480> pocket<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.770> looks<00:00:43.980> really

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that mid to low pocket it looks really

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
that mid to low pocket it looks really
shallow<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> head<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.870> wide

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
shallow just because the head so wide

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.119 
shallow just because the head so wide
and<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.590> thick<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:49.129> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and so thick if you can see all it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.720 
and so thick if you can see all it
actually<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.730> good<00:00:51.120> ball<00:00:51.539> placement<00:00:52.730> just

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
actually has good ball placement just

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.119 
actually has good ball placement just
needs<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.180> broken<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:55.489> and

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
needs to be broken in a little bit and

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.290 
needs to be broken in a little bit and
slew<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> release<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> any<00:01:00.090> sick

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
slew this release I think of any sick

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.770 
slew this release I think of any sick
I've<00:01:00.420> ever<00:01:00.570> strung<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.890> life<00:01:02.539> because<00:01:03.539> it's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I've ever strung in my life because it's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
I've ever strung in my life because it's
such<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> low<00:01:04.650> pocket<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.309> actually<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.670> even

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
such a low pocket it's actually not even

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
such a low pocket it's actually not even
offset<00:01:06.420> penance<00:01:07.320> before<00:01:08.040> they<00:01:08.220> invented

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
offset penance before they invented

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.560 
offset penance before they invented
offset<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.760> guys<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.299> know

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
offset which is this you guys don't know

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
offset which is this you guys don't know
see<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.380> head<00:01:13.619> curves<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.299> one's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
see how this head curves down this one's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
see how this head curves down this one's
straight<00:01:16.020> across<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
straight across this is one of the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.649 
straight across this is one of the
original<00:01:18.560> plastic<00:01:19.560> heads<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.920> believe<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.659> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
original plastic heads I believe and so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
original plastic heads I believe and so
he's<00:01:21.810> had<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> forever<00:01:22.229> since<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:23.040> played<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
he's had it forever since he played in

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
he's had it forever since he played in
college<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.330> 15<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> 20<00:01:25.140> years

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
college which had to be 15 to 20 years

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
college which had to be 15 to 20 years
ago<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.820> kreiling<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.479> if

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
ago and kreiling with it I don't know if

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
ago and kreiling with it I don't know if
you<00:01:27.630> ever<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.990> its<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.799> awkward

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you ever have its really really awkward

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
you ever have its really really awkward
because<00:01:29.909> when<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> ball<00:01:30.720> drops<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
because when the ball drops down it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
because when the ball drops down it
gives<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.430> weight<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.000> it's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
gives a little bit one weight so it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.469 
gives a little bit one weight so it's
easier<00:01:33.420> done<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.170> cradle<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.610> uh<00:01:35.640> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
easier done to cradle with but uh it's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
easier done to cradle with but uh it's
pretty<00:01:36.659> much<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.810> he<00:01:36.960> wanted<00:01:37.290> um<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.369> he

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
pretty much what he wanted um I think he

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
pretty much what he wanted um I think he
whited<00:01:38.880> went<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> Loyola<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.810> something<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.290> he

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
whited went to Loyola or something so he

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
whited went to Loyola or something so he
I<00:01:40.710> gave<00:01:41.100> him<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> gray<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.030> black<00:01:42.420> with

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I gave him the gray and the black with

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330 
I gave him the gray and the black with
the<00:01:42.750> white<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.380> forest<00:01:43.860> green<00:01:44.040> which<00:01:44.250> i

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the white on the forest green which i

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
the white on the forest green which i
think<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:45.090> awesome<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.570> was<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
think is really awesome I was going to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.980 
think is really awesome I was going to
put<00:01:46.079> poor<00:01:46.680> screen<00:01:47.009> shooters<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
put poor screen shooters in it but the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
put poor screen shooters in it but the
