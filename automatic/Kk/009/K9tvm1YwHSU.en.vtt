00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.330
 How am I in Seville? 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
 because there was an unprecedented dinner already 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.300
 I have told you on occasion that they are 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.000
 dinners where you first make a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 pairing with gels that directs enrique 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.730
 ferrer and then dinner is done 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 also paired with beer and in 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.370
 this time the truth is that the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.460
 chefs came together with the idea 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.410
 We were in Utrerera in a restaurant 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.720
 which is called versan a tapas 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.520
 and the truth is that they made a menu that 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.780
 It fit perfectly with beer and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.900
 In addition, the loaves that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.710
 they have a good relationship with a 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.040
 They made a bread baker Imedi 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.930
 really curious and I think that making a 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.570
 exitazo good dinner as always you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 I will teach the room I had already 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 been in an air what happens is that at 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.560
 next day I had to go very very 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.420
 soon and I had no chance to do 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.210
 to make the video 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.909
 They have several peculiarities that most 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.979
 I like it to me is that it has free wifi and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.229
 in this course the mind gives you a 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.420
 newspaper but open because having 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.920
 Wifi 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.750
 so I need a newspaper 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:36.280
 and then that the amenities do not have everything 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.430
 in many hotels they do not put you 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.500
 they do not put my toothbrush on me 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.200
 razor if you need it 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 they give it but they can not and that's fine 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.360
 because if you're going to put something that does not 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.390
 you need some other peculiarity is 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 who to whom in the toothbrush 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.110
 have 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.259
 the typical thing to do mouthwash 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.560
 the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.730
 and well as it is I am in Seville and for 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.070
 give you an idea of ​​the location 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 this state next to santa station 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.230
 just and these are the views 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.120
 and let's see the web 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.590
 let's get an idea of ​​the price 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.379
 although I insist that this is totally 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.989
 indicative because we do not know the dates 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.370
 and then there are usually good offers I hope 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.580
 that you have enjoyed a hug until 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.580
 then
