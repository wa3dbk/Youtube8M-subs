00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.010 

okay<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.380> that's<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.740> maximum<00:01:16.190> power<00:01:16.430> setter

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
okay so that's a maximum power setter

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:07.490 

okay<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.380> come<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.619> again

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 

there<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> fourth<00:02:08.640> sale<00:02:08.940> control<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
there is a fourth sale control and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:24.340 
there is a fourth sale control and
that's<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.080> out<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.619> mistake<00:02:11.370> rarely<00:02:12.360> anything

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.500 

when<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.500> breeze<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.460> we're<00:02:27.120> maxed

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
when the breeze is up and we're maxed

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090 
when the breeze is up and we're maxed
out<00:02:27.690> from<00:02:27.990> kicker<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.500> running<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.040> then

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
out from kicker and running and then

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.060 
out from kicker and running and then
even<00:02:29.280> out<00:02:29.750> we're<00:02:30.750> finding<00:02:31.290> we're<00:02:31.650> shooting

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
even out we're finding we're shooting

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.520 
even out we're finding we're shooting
the<00:02:32.160> boom<00:02:32.400> outside<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.240> quarter<00:02:33.690> simply

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the boom outside of the quarter simply

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.740 
the boom outside of the quarter simply
to<00:02:34.680> keep<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> focus<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.910> perhaps<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.540> should

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
to keep the focus and perhaps we should

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.840 
to keep the focus and perhaps we should
look<00:02:36.870> elsewhere<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.740> power<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
look elsewhere to think power and that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:03:06.740 
look elsewhere to think power and that
is<00:02:57.980> maybe<00:03:02.930> very<00:03:03.930> slow<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:06.300> help

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
is maybe very slow this will help

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
is maybe very slow this will help
balance<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.530> ring<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.250> make<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> little

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
balance the ring and make it a little

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.080 
balance the ring and make it a little
bit

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.960 

as<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:14.019> great<00:03:14.349> mass<00:03:14.800> back<00:03:15.160> with<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.760> kickoff

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
as we great mass back with the kickoff

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.979 
as we great mass back with the kickoff
of<00:03:16.690> course<00:03:16.959> we<00:03:17.170> have<00:03:17.349> got<00:03:17.560> some<00:03:17.920> fairly<00:03:18.310> no

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
of course we have got some fairly no

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.330 
of course we have got some fairly no
just<00:03:19.989> bear<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.500> mind<00:03:20.650> you've<00:03:21.069> got<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> ton
