think<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> good<00:00:28.859> idea<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> theory

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
think this is a good idea the theory

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.450 
think this is a good idea the theory
that<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> person<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.230> obese<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:32.160> spend

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
that if if a person is obese you spend

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
that if if a person is obese you spend
the<00:00:32.610> money<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.210> will<00:00:33.840> ultimately<00:00:34.380> spend

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the money now you will ultimately spend

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.420 
the money now you will ultimately spend
less<00:00:35.280> money<00:00:35.340> down<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> road<00:00:37.340> exactly<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
less money down the road exactly and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
less money down the road exactly and
it's<00:00:38.520> purely<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:39.059> economical<00:00:39.860> reasoning

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it's purely an economical reasoning

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's purely an economical reasoning
behind<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.640> mean<00:00:41.879> obese<00:00:42.360> people<00:00:42.570> spend

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
behind this I mean obese people spend

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
behind this I mean obese people spend

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
living

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.109 
living
if<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.500> person<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> surgery<00:01:11.760> does<00:01:11.970> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
if a person has the surgery does that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.710 
if a person has the surgery does that
then<00:01:13.020> change<00:01:13.380> their<00:01:13.590> life

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
then change their life

then change their life
well<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> certainly<00:01:16.950> people<00:01:17.880> have

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
well it can certainly people have

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.140 
well it can certainly people have
varying<00:01:19.560> results<00:01:20.340> following<00:01:20.939> these

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
varying results following these

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
varying results following these
procedures<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.310> opinion<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
procedures and it's my opinion that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.060 
procedures and it's my opinion that
patient<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:25.619> personal

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
patient has to take personal

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.780 
patient has to take personal
responsibility<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:27.150> some<00:01:27.360> degree<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.790> he's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
responsibility to some degree now he's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
responsibility to some degree now he's
correct<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.750> certainly<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.710> savings

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
correct in that certainly the savings

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.510 
correct in that certainly the savings
can<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.540> dramatic<00:01:33.590> but<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> savings<00:01:35.250> are

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
can be dramatic but the savings are

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.170 
can be dramatic but the savings are
really<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> patient<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> hue<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
really to the patient and the hue of

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
really to the patient and the hue of
less<00:01:39.180> food<00:01:39.450> costs<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.229> less<00:01:40.500> less<00:01:40.860> medication
