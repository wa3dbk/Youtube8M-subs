doing<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.319> was<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:02.300> kept<00:02:03.300> sticking<00:02:03.630> our<00:02:04.500> first<00:02:04.709> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
doing it was I kept sticking our first I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
doing it was I kept sticking our first I
kept<00:02:05.039> landing<00:02:05.190> up<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> round<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.940> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
kept landing up that round and that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.910 
kept landing up that round and that
usually<00:02:06.899> means<00:02:07.200> you're<00:02:07.319> not<00:02:07.380> flicking<00:02:07.679> hard

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
usually means you're not flicking hard

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.400 
usually means you're not flicking hard
enough<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.880> you're<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.179> popping<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> board

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
enough or you're not popping the board

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.710 
enough or you're not popping the board
hard<00:02:10.619> enough<00:02:10.819> which<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.030> easily<00:02:12.270> be<00:02:12.390> solved

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
hard enough which can easily be solved

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.520 
hard enough which can easily be solved
by<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.260> moving<00:02:14.069> your<00:02:14.160> feet<00:02:14.370> and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
by you know just moving your feet and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.410 
by you know just moving your feet and
ice<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:17.160> when<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.700> first<00:02:17.879> start<00:02:18.090> landing<00:02:18.209> them

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
ice like when I first start landing them

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.559 
ice like when I first start landing them
I<00:02:18.480> would<00:02:18.660> stick<00:02:18.959> them<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.500> um<00:02:20.090> I'd<00:02:21.090> land<00:02:21.390> them

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
I would stick them like um I'd land them

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.510 
I would stick them like um I'd land them
like<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.170> top<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> ribs<00:02:23.010> stick<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.340> this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
like on top of the ribs stick like this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.339 
like on top of the ribs stick like this
but<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.390> fall<00:02:24.690> because<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.170> there's

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
but not fall because you know there's

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.619 
but not fall because you know there's
two<00:02:25.470> wheels<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.790> looks<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> lot<00:02:27.239> harder<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
two wheels so it looks a lot harder to

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.910 
two wheels so it looks a lot harder to
roll<00:02:27.750> away<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.200> kickflipping<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.890> a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
roll away like kickflipping on a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.309 
roll away like kickflipping on a
skateboard<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.690> order<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:31.080> land

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
skateboard so in order to really land

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.360 
skateboard so in order to really land
this<00:02:31.440> you're<00:02:31.590> going<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.010> land<00:02:32.190> like

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
this you're going to have to land like

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.500 
this you're going to have to land like
your<00:02:32.640> feet<00:02:32.819> perfectly<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.750> all<00:02:35.060> both<00:02:36.060> ends<00:02:36.360> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
your feet perfectly on all both ends of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.750 
your feet perfectly on all both ends of
the<00:02:36.629> rip<00:02:36.810> stick

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the rip stick

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.390 
the rip stick
so<00:02:38.120> uh<00:02:38.769> you're<00:02:39.769> gonna<00:02:39.890> want<00:02:40.099> your<00:02:40.190> feet<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
so uh you're gonna want your feet to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.449 
so uh you're gonna want your feet to
land<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:42.709> how<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:42.890> want<00:02:43.099> your<00:02:43.159> feet<00:02:43.340> to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
try to learn if you can see it in midair

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.839 
try to learn if you can see it in midair
you<00:02:45.920> want<00:02:46.040> your<00:02:46.129> feet<00:02:46.220> aligned<00:02:46.430> like<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.700> so

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
you can easily right away because if I

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.729 
you can easily right away because if I
landed<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.159> many<00:02:49.280> times<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:50.110> this<00:02:51.110> or

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
landed so many times like this this or

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.680 
landed so many times like this this or
if<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.040> lean<00:02:52.190> too<00:02:52.340> far<00:02:52.519> forward<00:02:52.580> you're<00:02:53.540> going

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
if you lean too far forward you're going

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.759 
if you lean too far forward you're going
to<00:02:53.750> hit<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:53.989> ground<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:55.190> when<00:02:55.879> you<00:02:56.500> pop<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
to hit the ground so when you pop the

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.449 
to hit the ground so when you pop the
board<00:02:57.950> up<00:02:58.510> you're<00:02:59.510> gonna<00:03:00.010> want<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.069> make<00:03:01.129> sure

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
board up you're gonna want to make sure

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.430 
board up you're gonna want to make sure
you<00:03:02.269> have<00:03:02.390> your<00:03:02.480> shoulders<00:03:02.870> straight<00:03:03.019> with

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
you have your shoulders straight with

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.130 
you have your shoulders straight with
the<00:03:03.680> rip<00:03:04.010> stick<00:03:04.250> just<00:03:05.150> flick<00:03:05.540> off<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.959> while

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
the rip stick just flick off and while

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.470 
the rip stick just flick off and while
you're<00:03:06.260> flicking<00:03:06.410> off<00:03:06.640> keep<00:03:07.640> above<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.239> board

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you're flicking off keep above the board

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.050 
you're flicking off keep above the board
so<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:08.989> land<00:03:09.200> under<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.060> you're

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
so you can land under it and you're

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.940 
so you can land under it and you're
going<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.209> want<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:12.319> can<00:03:12.440> write<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.650> evenly

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
going to want to you can write it evenly

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.059 
going to want to you can write it evenly
let's<00:03:13.459> try<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.670> away<00:03:13.879> but<00:03:14.690> if<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.840> land<00:03:15.140> too

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
let's try it away but if you land too

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.890 
let's try it away but if you land too
much<00:03:16.250> board<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.790> can<00:03:16.910> easily<00:03:17.060> confiscate<00:03:17.720> by

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
much board you can easily confiscate by

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.440 
much board you can easily confiscate by
leaning<00:03:18.890> turning<00:03:19.700> your<00:03:19.790> front<00:03:20.060> panel

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
backwards even it out and then just

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.339 
backwards even it out and then just
right<00:03:23.120> away<00:03:23.239> um<00:03:25.599> like<00:03:26.599> I<00:03:26.720> said<00:03:26.750> before<00:03:27.109> you

and<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.609> fall

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.030 

alright<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.460> was<00:03:56.490> one<00:03:56.760> example<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:58.040> didn't

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
alright that was one example I didn't

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.140 
alright that was one example I didn't
flick<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.340> board<00:03:59.520> hard<00:03:59.730> enough<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.090> don't

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
flick the board hard enough and I don't

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.240 
flick the board hard enough and I don't
pop<00:04:00.420> hard<00:04:00.690> enough<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.770> landed<00:04:02.010> upside

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
pop hard enough so I just landed upside

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.880 
pop hard enough so I just landed upside
down<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.490> that<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.930> solve<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.830> problem

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
down like that so to solve that problem

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.640 
down like that so to solve that problem
make<00:04:05.760> sure<00:04:05.790> you're<00:04:06.060> hanging<00:04:06.510> your<00:04:07.320> foot<00:04:07.530> off

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
make sure you're hanging your foot off

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.140 
make sure you're hanging your foot off
the<00:04:07.800> back<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.190> tail<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.640> showed<00:04:08.820> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the back of the tail like I showed and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.030 
the back of the tail like I showed and
you<00:04:09.180> want<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.960> pop<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:10.290> hard<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.770> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
you want to pop as hard as you can and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.450 
you want to pop as hard as you can and
flick<00:04:11.640> off<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:12.120> hard<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.780> fast<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.460> it'll

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
flick off really hard and fast and it'll

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.760 
flick off really hard and fast and it'll
solve<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.790> problem<00:04:19.970> as<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.090> saw<00:04:21.270> there<00:04:21.480> i

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
solve that problem as you saw there i

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.950 
solve that problem as you saw there i
over<00:04:22.770> rotated<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.480> mentioned<00:04:24.480> me<00:04:24.540> not<00:04:24.720> flicked

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
over rotated it mentioned me not flicked

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.620 
over rotated it mentioned me not flicked
it<00:04:25.080> too<00:04:25.200> hard<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.430> solve<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.570> problem

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it too hard so to solve that problem

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.770 
it too hard so to solve that problem
either<00:04:28.050> put<00:04:28.320> more<00:04:28.560> foot<00:04:28.890> on<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.730> board<00:04:29.940> or

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
either put more foot on the board or

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.630 
either put more foot on the board or
have<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.960> slower<00:04:31.260> flick<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.950> slow<00:04:32.430> down<00:04:32.580> the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
have a slower flick and slow down the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:42.830 
have a slower flick and slow down the
rotation<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.300> board

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.740 

all<00:04:43.320> right<00:04:43.560> we<00:04:44.550> saw<00:04:44.730> there<00:04:44.940> was<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.300> stuck<00:04:45.600> it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
all right we saw there was I stuck it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.990 
all right we saw there was I stuck it
but<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:45.990> slipped<00:04:46.320> out<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:47.730> only<00:04:47.820> thing<00:04:47.940> I

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
but I slipped out and the only thing I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.310 
but I slipped out and the only thing I
did<00:04:48.120> wrong<00:04:48.240> there<00:04:48.450> was<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.720> just<00:04:48.900> leaned<00:04:49.080> back

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
did wrong there was I just leaned back

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.680 
did wrong there was I just leaned back
too<00:04:49.350> far<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.580> make<00:04:50.730> sure<00:04:50.760> when<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.060> land<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.510> it

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
too far so make sure when you land on it

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.020 
too far so make sure when you land on it
you<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.290> your<00:04:52.470> feet<00:04:52.680> centered<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.340> your

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
you have your feet centered and your

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.190 
you have your feet centered and your
weight<00:04:54.210> centered<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.750> don't<00:04:54.900> slip<00:04:55.080> out

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
weight centered so you don't slip out

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:08.540 
weight centered so you don't slip out
like<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.530> did

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.570 

so<00:05:09.300> that's<00:05:09.449> kickflips<00:05:09.870> for<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.430> they're<00:05:11.430> fun

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
so that's kickflips for you they're fun

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.909 
so that's kickflips for you they're fun
once<00:05:11.759> you<00:05:11.849> learn<00:05:12.360> them<00:05:12.509> just<00:05:13.470> make<00:05:13.620> sure<00:05:13.800> you

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
once you learn them just make sure you

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.159 
once you learn them just make sure you
practice<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.460> lot<00:05:14.490> because<00:05:14.910> they<00:05:15.750> are<00:05:15.900> harder

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
practice a lot because they are harder

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.779 
practice a lot because they are harder
than<00:05:16.289> kick<00:05:16.500> flips<00:05:16.710> on<00:05:16.860> skateboards<00:05:17.370> because

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
than kick flips on skateboards because

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.390 
than kick flips on skateboards because
the<00:05:17.940> rip<00:05:18.060> stick<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.389> obviously<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.750> lot<00:05:18.900> heavier

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
the rip stick is obviously a lot heavier

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.710 
the rip stick is obviously a lot heavier
so<00:05:20.400> just<00:05:20.849> keep<00:05:21.000> practicing<00:05:21.030> till<00:05:21.509> you<00:05:21.629> get

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
so just keep practicing till you get

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.790 
so just keep practicing till you get
them<00:05:21.860> make<00:05:22.860> sure<00:05:23.069> to<00:05:23.900> subscribe<00:05:24.900> thumbs<00:05:25.620> up
