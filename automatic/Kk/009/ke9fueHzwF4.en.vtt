00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.930
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.809
 I want to go bag with the br 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.879
 Hi, welcome to the picture, we started to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 study in the previous class 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.470
 the relationship between gas 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.470
 and greenhouse effect 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 we have until this moment that there is a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.670
 imbalance between the amount of gas 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.220
 carbon dioxide that is produced and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.680
 carbon dioxide that is consumed in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.219
 planet and we saw the factors that 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.159
 contribute to this imbalance is good 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.309
 in this class we will discuss how this 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:44.300
 imbalance between the production of gas 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.039
 consumption of carbon dioxide 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 contributes to the increased 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.960
 greenhouse 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 you must first consider that the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.489
 greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.659
 which means that the effect 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.229
 greenhouse is not harmful to the planet 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 quite the opposite controlled the effect 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.119
 maintenance of life in the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.399
 planet earth 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.000
 So I'm already representing the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.170
 planet earth ok and let's remember the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 following the atmosphere it forms a 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.719
 layer around planet earth layer 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 which is composed of a mixture of gases 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:38.700
 ok so here we have the atmosphere 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.140
 in fact all this space understood 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.909
 between the earth and the boundary of the atmosphere is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.189
 composed of gases by a mixture of 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.039
 gases and this is the only function of 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.200
 provide gases that are 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.649
 essential for life 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.560
 there is also heats the atmosphere 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.159
 surface of the planet it functions as 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.359
 kind of covered and why this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.690
 happens 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.510
 Good think. 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.270
 the entrance of the solar rays in the planet 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.730
 various solar rays enter the planet 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.200
 bringing energy 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.740
 a large part of this energy is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.510
 reflected back into the atmosphere and is 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.980
 reflected on the form of radiation 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.930
 infra red as we mentioned the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.310
 atmosphere is composed of a mixture of 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:46.870
 gas which types of gases eg steam 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:48.550
 of water methane gas carbon dioxide 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.140
 Their personal gases have a 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:57.070
 very interesting they can 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.240
 absorb some of this energy in France 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.980
 red 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:07.390
 part of this infrared radiation they 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:11.050
 not only absorb but also radiate 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:16.840
 this radiation in various directions 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.820
 including towards the planet earth and 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.050
 have a large part of the radiation 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.630
 infrared radiation that was reflected 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.810
 the sun's rays will affect the 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.640
 planet earth is absorbed by these 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.910
 gases in the atmosphere and again 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.410
 sent towards the planet earth is 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.780
 accumulation of energy in the form of 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.850
 infrared radiation that promote 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.459
 warming of the planet and this 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.519
 heating is very important for the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.100
 maintenance of life on Earth because it 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.650
 there was no such phenomenon 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.890
 the phenomenon of the greenhouse effect 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.410
 probably the land would be very cold and 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.050
 many living beings that exist here today 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.570
 could not exist 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.090
 so what is the problem that is 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.120
 related to the greenhouse effect 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.780
 well the problem is the following if we 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.639
 we increase the amount of carbon gas 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:27.700
 in the atmosphere will also increase the 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.070
 greenhouse gas emissions and if we 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.880
 greenhouse effect, what will happen to 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.070
 Earth 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.730
 It will get very hot and what 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.780
 means raising the temperature then 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:47.560
 temperatures have increased by more than 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.889
 account of the increase in greenhouse 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:55.690
 in turn have increased because of the 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.660
 accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.730
 we can mention some problems 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.990
 which are related to this increase in 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.970
 temperature 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:10.330
 for example a 4 to 5 degree increase 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:14.680
 can cause torrential storms in the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:19.090
 hottest dry weather 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:23.020
 in temperate regions melt 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.970
 polar ice caps, what is the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.290
 problems in these areas. 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.840
 polar 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:33.280
 melting ice will cause 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.800
 rise in sea level and this 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.820
 can generate problems such as 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.479
 flooding of coastal cities or 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.380
 the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.490
 essential for life when it is in 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.520
 balance 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.010
 but the imbalances caused by 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.560
 all those factors that we have seen in 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.860
 previous class has contributed to the 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.039
 increase in carbon dioxide and this increase 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.470
 greenhouse gas emissions will increase 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:09.130
 temperature of the planet which can 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.150
 various damages to the life of the 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.669
 planet 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.010
 good people, I hope you have 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.010
 understood keep studying
