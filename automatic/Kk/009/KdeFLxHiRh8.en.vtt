00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
more of my thoughts sweet so we got the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.419 
more of my thoughts sweet so we got the
actual<00:01:44.179> first<00:01:44.450> picture<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.800> series<00:01:46.250> right

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
actual first picture of the series right

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.260 
actual first picture of the series right
here<00:01:46.459> then<00:01:46.729> we'll<00:01:46.789> take<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.000> look<00:01:47.090> at<00:01:47.209> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
here then we'll take a look at the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.740 
here then we'll take a look at the
second<00:01:47.569> one<00:01:47.660> after<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:48.050> so<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.160> can<00:01:49.250> see

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
second one after this so as you can see

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350 
second one after this so as you can see
we<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.780> our<00:01:51.410> three<00:01:52.369> survivors<00:01:52.759> here<00:01:53.149> and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
we have our three survivors here and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.330 
we have our three survivors here and
then<00:01:53.450> what<00:01:53.810> appears<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.229> be<00:01:54.340> probably

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
then what appears to be probably

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.830 
then what appears to be probably
somebody<00:01:55.700> who's<00:01:55.849> just<00:01:55.910> recently<00:01:56.390> deceased

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
somebody who's just recently deceased

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.050 
somebody who's just recently deceased
and<00:01:57.170> looks<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.740> be<00:01:57.920> probably<00:01:58.429> beginning<00:01:58.849> to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
and looks to be probably beginning to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.359 
and looks to be probably beginning to
turn<00:01:59.209> into<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> zombie<00:01:59.539> or<00:02:00.140> navy<00:02:00.770> turning<00:02:01.190> into

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
turn into a zombie or navy turning into

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.940 
turn into a zombie or navy turning into
a<00:02:01.399> zombie<00:02:01.490> fairly<00:02:02.179> soon<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:03.349> this<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.740> first

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
a zombie fairly soon is this the first

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.559 
a zombie fairly soon is this the first
zombie<00:02:04.250> encounter<00:02:04.849> of<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:04.970> series<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.420> guess

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
zombie encounter of the series I guess

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.690 
zombie encounter of the series I guess
we'll<00:02:05.690> have<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.869> wait<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.050> see<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:07.190> explain<00:02:07.489> we

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
we'll have to wait and see to explain we

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.580 
we'll have to wait and see to explain we
have<00:02:07.880> at<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.270> top<00:02:08.509> left<00:02:08.780> cliff<00:02:09.080> Curtis<00:02:09.470> is

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
have at the top left cliff Curtis is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.380 
have at the top left cliff Curtis is
going<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.800> play<00:02:09.950> our<00:02:10.099> male<00:02:10.340> lead<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:11.030> have<00:02:11.180> Kim

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
going to play our male lead we have Kim

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.610 
going to play our male lead we have Kim
Dickens<00:02:11.660> who's<00:02:12.020> going<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.230> play<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.440> female

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.470 
Dickens who's going to play the female
lead<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.520> believe<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.239> Frank

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480

lead and then I believe this is Frank
Dillane<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.940> not<00:02:16.940> hundred<00:02:17.209> percent<00:02:17.450> sure

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
Dillane I think not hundred percent sure

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.500 
Dillane I think not hundred percent sure

and years of dead universe of walking
dead<00:02:48.530> world<00:02:48.769> like<00:02:49.400> Rick's<00:02:49.730> group<00:02:49.879> has<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.450> the

dead world like Rick's group has in the
original<00:02:51.109> walking<00:02:51.620> dead<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.189> this<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:52.670> not

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
going to sync up with it anyway it's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.569 
going to sync up with it anyway it's
going<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.319> be<00:02:54.409> totally<00:02:54.650> independent<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.189> it's

going to be totally independent and it's

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.130 
going to be totally independent and it's
going<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:55.849> running<00:02:56.060> its<00:02:56.269> own<00:02:56.420> time<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
going to be running its own time you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.259 
going to be running its own time you
know<00:02:57.500> time<00:02:57.739> frame<00:02:58.159> starting<00:02:58.819> from<00:02:58.849> what<00:02:59.150> looks

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
know time frame starting from what looks

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.460 
know time frame starting from what looks
to<00:02:59.390> be<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.599> very<00:02:59.810> beginning<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.379> the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
to be the very beginning of the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.050 
to be the very beginning of the
apocalypse<00:03:00.980> which<00:03:01.459> should<00:03:01.609> be<00:03:01.730> cool<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:02.000> see

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
apocalypse which should be cool to see

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.059 
apocalypse which should be cool to see
because<00:03:02.269> we<00:03:02.450> never<00:03:02.569> really<00:03:02.900> saw<00:03:03.109> much<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.829> a

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
because we never really saw much of a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.869 
because we never really saw much of a
breakout<00:03:04.639> type<00:03:06.129> sequence<00:03:07.129> in<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.549> walking

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
breakout type sequence in the walking

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.009 
breakout type sequence in the walking
dead<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.150> know<00:03:08.269> Rick<00:03:08.450> wakes<00:03:08.659> up<00:03:08.780> from<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
not too much so it looks like with this

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.160 
not too much so it looks like with this
one<00:03:14.359> we're<00:03:14.480> actually<00:03:14.569> going<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.870> see<00:03:14.989> that

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
hope we're going to get a lot of

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.039 
hope we're going to get a lot of
episodes<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.329> who<00:03:20.450> knows<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.659> mean<00:03:20.930> they

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
episodes but but who knows I mean they

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.319 
episodes but but who knows I mean they
could<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.379> they<00:03:21.620> can<00:03:22.040> do<00:03:22.129> six<00:03:22.400> legs<00:03:22.639> listed<00:03:23.090> or

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
could do they can do six legs listed or

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.030 
could do they can do six legs listed or
they<00:03:23.540> could<00:03:23.599> do<00:03:23.780> more<00:03:24.049> hopefully<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:24.889> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
they could do more hopefully with the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.679 
they could do more hopefully with the
second<00:03:25.340> season<00:03:25.489> they<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:25.909> even<00:03:26.090> even<00:03:26.599> do

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
second season they will even even do

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.659 
second season they will even even do
more<00:03:26.870> than<00:03:26.959> six<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.530> hope<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:27.829> that's<00:03:28.489> it

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
more than six I I hope so that's it

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.970 
more than six I I hope so that's it
looks<00:03:29.569> cool<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.810> terms<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.769> first

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
looks cool in terms of the the first

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.960 
looks cool in terms of the the first
picture<00:03:31.189> let's<00:03:31.310> take<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> look<00:03:31.549> at<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.669> second

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
picture let's take a look at the second

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.259 
picture let's take a look at the second
one<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.680> again<00:03:33.859> this<00:03:34.099> one<00:03:34.340> are<00:03:34.579> male<00:03:35.239> and

female lead of course with Kim Dickens

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.149 
female lead of course with Kim Dickens
standing<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:37.609> front<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.359> first<00:03:38.569> in<00:03:38.689> the<00:03:38.750> back

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
standing in front the first in the back

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.559 
standing in front the first in the back
not<00:03:40.159> sure<00:03:40.220> what<00:03:40.549> location<00:03:40.939> this<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.239> that<00:03:41.540> I

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
not sure what location this is that I

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.839 
not sure what location this is that I
can't<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.169> can't<00:03:42.199> quite<00:03:42.530> tell<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.370> almost<00:03:43.549> think

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
can't I can't quite tell I almost think

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.159 
can't I can't quite tell I almost think
like<00:03:44.000> at<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.329> back<00:03:44.479> right<00:03:44.690> there<00:03:44.930> there's

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
like at the back right there there's

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.349 
like at the back right there there's
like<00:03:45.199> a<00:03:45.290> barrel<00:03:45.889> and<00:03:46.310> some<00:03:46.519> kind<00:03:46.729> of<00:03:46.849> chemicals

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
like a barrel and some kind of chemicals

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.289 
like a barrel and some kind of chemicals
or<00:03:47.510> something<00:03:48.129> not<00:03:49.129> quite<00:03:49.489> sure<00:03:49.519> when<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.060> first

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
or something not quite sure when I first

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.149 
or something not quite sure when I first
saw<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:50.780> thought<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.959> was<00:03:51.079> a<00:03:51.139> church<00:03:51.440> then<00:03:52.129> I

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
saw it I thought it was a church then I

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.589 
saw it I thought it was a church then I
think<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.609> might<00:03:52.699> be<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.940> high<00:03:53.060> school<00:03:53.359> I'm

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
think it might be the high school I'm

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.619 
think it might be the high school I'm
just<00:03:54.229> not<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.769> hundred<00:03:54.949> percent<00:03:55.180> positive<00:03:56.180> on

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
just not a hundred percent positive on

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.539 
just not a hundred percent positive on
what<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.799> had<00:03:57.979> maybe<00:03:58.280> high<00:03:58.519> school

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
what this is I had maybe high school

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.059 
what this is I had maybe high school
will<00:03:58.849> be<00:03:58.879> your<00:03:59.060> best<00:03:59.329> bet<00:03:59.569> that's<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.650> looks

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
will be your best bet that's it looks

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.580 
will be your best bet that's it looks
well<00:04:01.879> not<00:04:02.299> much<00:04:02.479> to<00:04:02.720> say<00:04:02.870> really<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.409> looks

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
well not much to say really it looks

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.050 
well not much to say really it looks

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
couple quotes here that we can break

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.029 
couple quotes here that we can break
down<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.750> first<00:04:23.930> one<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.110> we<00:04:24.860> take

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
down and the first one is we take

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.189 
down and the first one is we take
incredibly<00:04:25.849> seriously<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.510> notion<00:04:26.720> of

incredibly seriously the notion of

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.670 
incredibly seriously the notion of
