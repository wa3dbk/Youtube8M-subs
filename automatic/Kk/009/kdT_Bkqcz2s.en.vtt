00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.950
 the rain arrives without warning and sometimes 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.020
 it does not matter nor look at meteorology 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.540
 if it falls it will interfere further in the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.370
 How do you drive a motorcycle? 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.650

 prefer synthetic fabrics since they are 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.590
 lighter and take up less space 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 remember to buy a larger size 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.970
 because you will watch over your clothes 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 the same goes for boots or leggings 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.730
 they need to get into their pet on the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.309
 your shoe 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.350
 Another tip is in the rain the visor can 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.550
 pass to carry no anti fog 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.410
 lose visibility 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 if you were caught by the rain 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.710
 on the street does not stop anywhere to 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.809
 put on the cover is better take a while 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.089
 who has suffered an accident when 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.570
 raining the worst difficulty is the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.210
 Helmet blurs amounted to us shall 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.710
 hand and 35 years will start the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.710
 send them have in visual 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.740
 the first moments of rain are the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.720
 more dangerous 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.090
 the water mixes with the dirt and leaves 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.649
 slippery asphalt the state of the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.149
 tire is crucial in the rain 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.310
 check for wear on indicators 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.580
 which are on the tire itself if 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.960
 too much expense can cause the bike to glide 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.090
 to vote for another in the rain is extremely 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.149
 very careful with the brakes 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.799
 To talk and when to leave, do not 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.299
 forget the lighthouse it needs to be 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.080
 connected at all times to 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.080
 improve visibility 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.530
 the damage does not make sudden movements 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.080
 that the floor is less adherent all that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.520
 to accelerate 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.509
 be done more carefully than the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.310
 conventional 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.530
 pay attention to spots on faults 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.479
 can be dripping oil or saying what 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.909
 makes the asphalt very slippery 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.489
 in rainy day use a good good cover 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.239
 helmet because safety is worth your 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.280
 life 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.049
 the bikes should not face the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.360
 floodwaters may exist 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.360
 open that are a danger underwater 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.060
 rain is only dangerous if you do not take 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.709
 careful attention in a good way 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.739
 a little water does not hurt the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.739
 nobody
