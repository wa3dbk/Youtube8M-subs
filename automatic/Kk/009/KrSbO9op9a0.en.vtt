mean i'd like to think so i say I've
been<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> around<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> squads<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.079> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
obviously you know it was the situation

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
obviously you know it was the situation
was<00:01:44.159> slightly<00:01:44.399> different<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> fortunately

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
was slightly different and fortunately

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
was slightly different and fortunately
you<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> changeover<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.040> manager

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you know the changeover of manager

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130

before<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> tournament<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.210> an<00:01:48.329> ideal<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
before the tournament was an ideal so I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
before the tournament was an ideal so I
think<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> starts<00:01:50.189> properly<00:01:50.549> Roy<00:01:50.700> he's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
think now it starts properly Roy he's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
think now it starts properly Roy he's
being<00:01:51.000> able<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.329> start<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> implement<00:01:52.140> his<00:01:52.590> own

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
being able to start to implement his own

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
being able to start to implement his own

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
across more and more I suppose one of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.580 
across more and more I suppose one of
the<00:02:02.399> real<00:02:02.520> benefits<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.149> winning<00:02:03.590> burn

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the real benefits of that winning burn

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.350 
the real benefits of that winning burn
