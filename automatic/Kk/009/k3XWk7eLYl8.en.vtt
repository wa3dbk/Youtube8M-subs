00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.230
 Bolt has started art more than other 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.480
 janabi mod for minecraft this way what 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.430
 what it brings are fireworks and let's go 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 to see the use of table postman to 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.340
 capture fuzz with gunpowder and with rope the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.989
 we put in this way and we have like 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.529
 we take a push and we put it here 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.509
 this assumes that it is wick now with paper 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.510
 we do this 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.800
 gunpowder in the middle and with ton balloons 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.809
 dust we do this with this a hanabi the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 we take and see the creative way 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.850
 to have infinities because they want to 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.460
 one then we spend and we will have to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.670
 do more and more then let's check 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.059
 how do you see the care for exploiting 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.940
 in this way and nothing more cerebral 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.359
 many things with this mode but one and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.720
 more in creative mode with the take 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.729
 items as you see we have many more but 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.789
 the crafter is unknown we're going to catch 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.600
 and we're going to see them all for 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.159
 finish well to show this you see 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.570
 is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 is 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.130
 how big is 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.480
 the reservations this is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.540
 pretty stable 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.490
 I liked the heroes a lot 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.200
 we like them 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:50.030
 pretty cool let's see the last 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.030
 and that knowledge god as faith 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.320
 for five times look 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.690
 but I hope you liked this mod 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.670
 and that I did a little fool and ranges 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.260
 I think you liked it and we'll see you in the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.330
 installation of the mod 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.130
 we are in the installation of annabi and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.950
 we go to these two pages in the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.980
 first page we go down to click 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.990
 janadi click 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 will take us to this page 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.260
 once here we wait for the option that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 we want 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.390
 in my case it will be this click 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.100
 to accept we go down a bit and with them 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.890

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.050
 mailmen you see here it's good we go 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.920
 to the second link we go down to moto to 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.900
 see once there all sticks click 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.090
 accept if we want the previous version 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.660
 of the motorcycle to see diverse and there the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.870
 we will have 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.150
 we passed these two files to the desktop 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.870
 once they are there we are going to start 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.750
 xp users will appear to execute and there 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.320
 we have to write percent app data 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.120
 percent comic we go to micro 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.910
 We enter bi click minecraft click 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.800
 right to open select a program 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.760
 from the list of installed programs click 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.030

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.930
 we closed the folder 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.750
 once in the winner file you click 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.550
 delete if we open mod loader 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.610
 we celebrate everything and we accept it 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.690
 we have engine we open ya nagy and we do 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.910
 the same 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.130
 we select everything and we pass it to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.410
 accept and close everything 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.390
 and we are going to open our micro for 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.760
 test if the motorcycle is installed 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.660
 correctly let's open it dongling 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 large screen that looks good and like 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.090
 you see is loading now it seems that yes 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.850
 that works but you have to be 100% 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.090
 sure so let's go into a mode 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.090
 creative 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.980
 as expected for the world to carry 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.799
 we are entering press the e in 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.650
 followed here we are and we will see 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.140
 first if it is around here and if we have 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.090
 that luck will be incredible but if 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.379
 not so 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.069
 it will not be lucky to have here as it is 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.549
 here is the mod 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.639
 janabi let's check now what was 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.770
 which I liked I think it was the last 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.680
 first let's see the original here 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.120
 is the original as is the mod works 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.760
 correctly let's try the one that I 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.340
 taste 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.560
 pum 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.150
 for this so before starting another 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.510
 way 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.110
 so clear that this is not different 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.400
 This was mine, this being and that I liked 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.190
