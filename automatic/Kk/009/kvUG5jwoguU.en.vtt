00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
is an area where they can actually

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.779 
is an area where they can actually

madden 13 and apply it to the line play
but<00:00:33.850> first<00:00:34.059> we're<00:00:34.270> going<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.420> take<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.660> look<00:00:34.840> at

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
but first we're going to take a look at

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.319 
but first we're going to take a look at
blocking<00:00:35.260> logic<00:00:35.829> look<00:00:36.219> at<00:00:36.309> my<00:00:36.460> fallback<00:00:36.730> here

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
blocking logic look at my fallback here

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.660 
blocking logic look at my fallback here
named<00:00:37.510> 85<00:00:38.020> and<00:00:38.289> on<00:00:38.410> this<00:00:38.590> is<00:00:38.770> an<00:00:38.949> older<00:00:39.219> roster

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
named 85 and on this is an older roster

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.600 
named 85 and on this is an older roster
because<00:00:40.270> this<00:00:40.540> is<00:00:40.750> an<00:00:40.930> offline<00:00:41.410> CCM<00:00:41.980> I<00:00:42.130> started

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
because this is an offline CCM I started

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.280 
because this is an offline CCM I started
before<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.239> updates<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:43.930> i<00:00:43.960> believe<00:00:44.170> the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
before the updates and i believe the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.080 
before the updates and i believe the
updates<00:00:44.590> come<00:00:44.829> out<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.460> know<00:00:45.489> later<00:00:45.910> this

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
week as far as CCM but take a look at

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.590 
week as far as CCM but take a look at
this<00:00:49.410> why<00:00:50.410> would<00:00:50.620> he<00:00:50.739> do<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.540> now<00:00:52.540> I<00:00:52.570> can

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
this why would he do that now I can

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.030 
this why would he do that now I can
understand<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:53.380> know<00:00:53.530> you're<00:00:53.710> trying<00:00:53.890> to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
understand you know you're trying to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.090 
understand you know you're trying to
decide<00:00:54.370> who's<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.730> best<00:00:54.940> guy<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.210> block<00:00:56.100> but

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
decide who's the best guy to block but

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.970 
decide who's the best guy to block but
why<00:00:57.250> would<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.640> stop<00:00:58.140> turn<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.170> lock<00:00:59.680> in<00:00:59.890> on

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
why would you stop turn and lock in on

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.620 
why would you stop turn and lock in on
somebody<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.640> inside<00:01:00.670> it's<00:01:01.210> almost<00:01:01.420> like

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
somebody on the inside it's almost like

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.959 
somebody on the inside it's almost like
he<00:01:01.809> was<00:01:01.930> locked<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.410> on<00:01:02.590> London<00:01:03.430> Fletcher<00:01:03.610> for

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
he was locked in on London Fletcher for

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.870 
he was locked in on London Fletcher for
a<00:01:04.059> moment<00:01:04.560> and<00:01:05.560> then<00:01:05.829> once<00:01:06.159> he<00:01:06.280> realizes<00:01:06.640> he

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
a moment and then once he realizes he

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.429 
a moment and then once he realizes he
can't<00:01:07.090> make<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.450> play<00:01:07.719> then<00:01:07.930> he<00:01:08.020> turns<00:01:08.290> back

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
can't make that play then he turns back

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.410 
can't make that play then he turns back
around<00:01:08.560> but<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.189> just<00:01:09.369> looks<00:01:09.460> bad<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.329> know

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:12.069 
this is something that has to be cleaned

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.309 
this is something that has to be cleaned
up<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.969> know<00:01:13.119> just<00:01:13.389> have<00:01:13.869> these<00:01:14.079> guys

up you know just have these guys
continue<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:14.979> go<00:01:15.219> forward<00:01:15.249> and<00:01:15.819> I've<00:01:16.179> seen<00:01:16.450> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
continue to go forward and I've seen it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.179 
continue to go forward and I've seen it
in<00:01:16.719> this<00:01:16.840> game<00:01:17.079> I<00:01:17.109> got<00:01:17.439> players<00:01:17.709> to<00:01:17.920> show<00:01:18.130> you

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
in this game I got players to show you

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.179 
in this game I got players to show you
I've<00:01:18.459> seen<00:01:18.759> great<00:01:19.060> blocking<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.799> right<00:01:20.979> here

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
I've seen great blocking but right here

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.859 
I've seen great blocking but right here
I'm<00:01:21.340> trying<00:01:21.609> to<00:01:21.700> set<00:01:21.880> up<00:01:21.999> this<00:01:22.149> run<00:01:22.450> i<00:01:22.479> was

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
I'm trying to set up this run i was

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.389 
I'm trying to set up this run i was
going<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.109> go<00:01:23.289> to<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.529> outside<00:01:23.950> but<00:01:24.130> as<00:01:24.279> you

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
going to go to the outside but as you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.249 
going to go to the outside but as you
see<00:01:24.609> right<00:01:24.639> there<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.509> looks<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.869> Wallace

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
see right there it looks like Wallace

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.859 
see right there it looks like Wallace
was<00:01:26.499> pushing<00:01:26.920> him<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.789> outside<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.539> cut

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
was pushing him to the outside so I cut

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.340 
was pushing him to the outside so I cut
on<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.109> inside<00:01:29.609> but<00:01:30.609> as<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.909> can<00:01:31.060> see<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.899> DB

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
on the inside but as you can see the DB

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.279 
on the inside but as you can see the DB
and<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:32.920> believe<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.340> some<00:01:33.579> DeAngelo<00:01:34.479> Hall<00:01:34.659> he

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
and I believe that some DeAngelo Hall he

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.639 
and I believe that some DeAngelo Hall he
spends<00:01:35.709> to<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.039> inside<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:37.929> know<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.469> kind

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
spends to the inside so you know it kind

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.230 
spends to the inside so you know it kind
of<00:01:38.679> closes<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.249> my<00:01:39.399> lane<00:01:39.639> a<00:01:39.670> little<00:01:39.999> bit<00:01:40.149> but

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
of closes up my lane a little bit but

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.879 
of closes up my lane a little bit but
what<00:01:40.389> I<00:01:40.420> want<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.749> showcase<00:01:40.959> his<00:01:41.349> look<00:01:41.619> at<00:01:41.740> how
