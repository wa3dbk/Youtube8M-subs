are<00:00:17.550> probably<00:00:17.670> familiar<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.470> is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
are probably familiar with it this is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.019 
are probably familiar with it this is
cell<00:00:19.980> mats<00:00:20.250> from<00:00:20.580> BSN<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.410> 2.0<00:00:23.029> I've

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
cell mats from BSN so that's 2.0 I've

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
cell mats from BSN so that's 2.0 I've
never<00:00:24.269> had<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.630> that's<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.019> point<00:00:25.230> oh<00:00:25.519> let

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
never had so that's one point oh let

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.830 
never had so that's one point oh let
alone<00:00:26.730> 2.0<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:28.320> BSN<00:00:29.390> always<00:00:30.390> makes<00:00:30.599> good

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
alone 2.0 but BSN always makes good

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
alone 2.0 but BSN always makes good
stuff<00:00:31.080> I've<00:00:31.560> never<00:00:31.800> been<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.160> point<00:00:32.460> by<00:00:32.640> them

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
stuff I've never been this point by them

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.299 
stuff I've never been this point by them
or<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.630> them<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.950> should<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.190> pretty

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
or from them so this should be pretty

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.630 
or from them so this should be pretty
good<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.620> send<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.980> out<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> us<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
good and they send this out to us to

I get from looking at this is you get a
little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> protein<00:00:49.039> glutamine

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
little bit of protein glutamine

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.290 
little bit of protein glutamine
glutamine<00:00:50.820> peptides<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> creatine<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> yeah

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
glutamine peptides and creatine so yeah

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.840

thing I don't know what it is bad about
extract<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.159> might<00:01:35.369> extract<00:01:36.259> whatever

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
extract but I might extract whatever

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
extract but I might extract whatever
that<00:01:37.439> has<00:01:37.939> yeah<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.479> much<00:01:39.600> creatine

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that has yeah pretty much creatine

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
that has yeah pretty much creatine
glutamine<00:01:40.430> glutamine<00:01:41.430> peptides<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> little

glutamine glutamine peptides in a little

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.069 
glutamine glutamine peptides in a little
bit<00:01:42.450> protein<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> looks<00:01:44.430> good<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:45.570> scoop<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
bit protein so looks good one scoop it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
bit protein so looks good one scoop it
says<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.530> mix<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> four<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> six<00:01:47.250> ounces<00:01:47.790> water

00:01:48.030 --> 00:02:00.870 
says to mix in four to six ounces water
I<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:49.350> six<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:51.500> yeah<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.960> arctic<00:01:54.960> berry

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.380 

and<00:02:01.180> actually<00:02:05.430> directions<00:02:06.430> say<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.909> dietary

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
and actually directions say as a dietary

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.960 
and actually directions say as a dietary
supplement<00:02:07.509> mix<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.500> scoop<00:02:08.830> four<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> six

ounces<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.360> cold<00:02:10.509> water<00:02:11.430> twice<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> day<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.290> I'm

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
ounces of cold water twice a day so I'm

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.440 
ounces of cold water twice a day so I'm
assuming<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.010> each<00:02:18.190> scoop<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.790> roughly

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
assuming that in each scoop is roughly

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.570 
assuming that in each scoop is roughly
two<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.780> half<00:02:19.900> grams<00:02:20.110> creatine<00:02:20.620> because<00:02:21.340> on

a bear you can a fruity drink a little

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.620 
a bear you can a fruity drink a little
bit<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.390> foam<00:03:42.600> they're<00:03:44.240> mixed<00:03:45.240> up<00:03:45.330> pretty<00:03:45.510> well

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
bit of foam they're mixed up pretty well

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.240 
bit of foam they're mixed up pretty well
I<00:03:45.780> suppose<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.380> here<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> let<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:46.800> sit<00:03:47.010> for<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
I suppose like here to let it sit for a

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.750 
I suppose like here to let it sit for a
little<00:03:47.340> bit<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.880> foam<00:03:48.540> would<00:03:48.660> go<00:03:48.840> away<00:03:49.050> but

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
little bit that foam would go away but

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.290 
little bit that foam would go away but
break<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.910> flavor<00:03:51.210> um

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
break the flavor um

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.910 
break the flavor um
berry<00:03:54.320> just<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.410> berry<00:03:55.650> flavored<00:03:56.430> drink<00:03:57.710> if<00:03:58.710> I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
berry just a berry flavored drink if I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.460 
berry just a berry flavored drink if I
was<00:03:59.010> gonna<00:03:59.130> be<00:03:59.250> taking<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.700> here<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:01.350> know

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
was gonna be taking this here you know

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650 
was gonna be taking this here you know
in<00:04:01.860> future<00:04:02.100> I'd<00:04:02.700> probably<00:04:02.910> do<00:04:03.120> two<00:04:03.300> scoops

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
in future I'd probably do two scoops

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.300 
in future I'd probably do two scoops
just<00:04:04.310> because<00:04:05.310> uh<00:04:06.170> eight<00:04:07.170> grams<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:08.010> all<00:04:08.160> of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
just because uh eight grams of all of

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.640 
just because uh eight grams of all of
those<00:04:09.620> together

I'm gonna guess two scoops will get you
at<00:04:18.660> least<00:04:18.840> five<00:04:19.049> grams<00:04:19.320> creatine<00:04:19.830> but<00:04:20.519> that's

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670
