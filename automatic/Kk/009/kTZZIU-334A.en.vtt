00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
negate attack so to speak plus I would

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.770 
negate attack so to speak plus I would
give<00:02:50.310> their<00:02:50.460> monster<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.850> boost<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
give their monster a boost and the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.060 
give their monster a boost and the
better<00:02:51.960> players<00:02:52.170> were<00:02:52.350> running<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.740> card<00:02:52.980> so

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
better players were running this card so

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.470 
better players were running this card so
I<00:02:53.100> got<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.430> hacky<00:02:53.640> work<00:02:53.910> directly<00:02:54.270> and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
I got just two hacky work directly and

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.060 
I got just two hacky work directly and
you<00:02:54.870> take<00:02:55.110> even<00:02:55.140> more<00:02:55.380> than<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.710> thousand

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
you take even more than a thousand

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.620 
you take even more than a thousand
damage<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.700> it'd<00:02:56.940> be<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> pain<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.450> ass

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
damage so it'd be a pain in the ass

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.700 
damage so it'd be a pain in the ass
that's<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.960> only<00:02:58.080> reason<00:02:58.140> why<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.350> ran<00:02:58.530> this

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
that's the only reason why I ran this

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.470 
that's the only reason why I ran this
and<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.250> always<00:02:59.370> did<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.850> main<00:03:00.060> phase<00:03:00.270> 2

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and I always did this like main phase 2

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480 
and I always did this like main phase 2
and<00:03:00.510> whatnot<00:03:00.930> next<00:03:01.770> card<00:03:01.950> was<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> best

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
and whatnot next card was like the best

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.460 
and whatnot next card was like the best
card<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.000> was<00:03:03.090> an<00:03:03.210> emergency<00:03:03.450> teleport<00:03:04.020> for
