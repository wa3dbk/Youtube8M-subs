00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.050
 kimi raikkonen that follows him for the moment and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.199
 care is not passed braking has not been 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.210
 enter magnussen bernie attacking libya 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.710
 the convenient position is lost 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 but it's already ahead you can play with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 magnussen we see here the car of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.590
 mezquitán and travels outside is not 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.539
 It is more outside than inside will 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.539
 losing that position is also a bit 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.060
 boxed in from time clean exit what 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.740
 saw no touch 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.900
 so green flag around the 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.770
 sochi circuit right now rosberg 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.770
 hamilton boots button alonso magnussen 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
 rosberg 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.000
 with vettel and radio communication pedro 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.890
 of rose they are telling you that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.160
 return the position to hamilton because 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.650
 it has skipped the curve but terrible 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.300
 good to see the exit amazing because 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.310
 there have been cars everywhere in 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 all the curves on curve 2 the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.780
 data 4 in the 5 all outside by the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.700
 asphalt loopholes and now has 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 let go to hamilton and eye what has 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.090
 said ros see by radio and it says in addition 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.080
 I have a vibration because it makes a 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.869
 plane in the first braking beasts 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.990
 it's worth nico rosberg has had to touch 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.990
 with something of the blockade 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.000
 massa 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.190
 right now 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 has vibrations it is that got you a 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.910
 brutal tornado flat but also has 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.730
 been long the long and at maximum speed 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.650
 because they reach 300 at the start and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.020
 moves away the square tire that occurs 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.940
 when this happens, it's nothing 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.620
 absolutely nothing of the car vibrates so much 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.450
 I enjoy the suspensions you can 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.310
 put in danger has put the tire 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.500
 hard and now he will try to make a 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.150
 longest possible and good style and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.530
 cross your fingers that is something 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.530
 means the time for spills 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.000
 well, first stop for robert 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 first mass stop the world that is 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.610
 he's very face right now for louis 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.990
 hamilton and let's see why also 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.260
 We've got goose bumps 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.490
 with friction I do not know if something more than rubbing 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.890
 that there has been the terry I want and 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.020
 sebastián mind the moment vettel by 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.810
 ahead but he was still about to leave 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.370
 to retouch if he left at 12 and look 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.410
 what's more the club's outing since it's 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.120
 tenth now I have to let go 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.890
 vettel and I require are not orders that 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.810

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.770
