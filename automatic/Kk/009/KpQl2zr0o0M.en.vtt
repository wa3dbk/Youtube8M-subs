00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.580
 and equally needy commenting and how 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.100
 you are watching I am playing taking the 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.040
 flag and I have not gotten I do not know what to play 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.710
 I was rolling a custom whip moat 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.570
 by mercenaries and you know to know 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.669
 playing alone that are not games with there 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.679
 groups of people then in another play 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.779
 mess against people who are playing 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.579
 alone as you go then good to me 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.259
 I have gotten around here I had to take the 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.630
 flag I have carried the gusts that 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.039
 I have in this device the game mode and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.210
 Well the truth is that we are winning the 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.710
 live game but in 100 more than 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.079
 It's all because I 'm already wrong with the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.820
 throat and I have stayed a bit I'm going to 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.170
 for her so joke provided for 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.760
 comment them I say it is not a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.590
 departure for nothing spectacular but I 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.160
 He liked it because it 's the best thing in the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.010
 departure 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.840
 there is a total in which 40 people pass 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.830
 for the game while they are going to enter 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.230
 weeks 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.760
 from my team came in the other here I had a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.110
 hand in hand with him has here that just 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.510
 to kill and it was all rabid 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.370
 waiting for me in the shin another 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.660
 with a smile and that grows nothing like 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.030
 another one appears there 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.290
 that is, it has made me quite curious how 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.330
 play to that people because if you get involved 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.400
 to play way to take the flag and enter 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.380
 and you start playing in normal mode 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.150
 they play five or six friends and they go super 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.800
 blended here everyone goes to their own 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.780
 one is dedicated only will go is going to 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.760
 run others are dedicated to defend or what 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 best of all that except that you touch 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.170
 your team stays in the six 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.390
 defending and everything is clear they tell you 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.720
 come crazy already act for the flag not 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.550
 then let's say that something you say hears 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.810
 please call that you see that they carry 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.430
 half which took advantage of 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.630
 just two appear behind 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.550
 benefit to stay here waiting 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.140
 that we capture the flag but my 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.990
 mates I do not know what the hell they did 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.180
 because they were all all there and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.860
 they defeated them so they put the flag 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.539
 and they killed them here said there are other ways 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.110
 but I have to capture the flag 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.910
 and he took it but it is not just them 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.039
 kill is not returned by a thing or the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.840
 another to kill me is plan to take 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.039
 the flag my colleagues here you see what 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.690
 that they did not do anything but get in 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.940
 down we had controlled the part of 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.770
 down but as we left we were killed or 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.810
 be what you see here is how I say to 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.610
 see who's nosing where we're giving and 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.200
 here nobody knew about it or was 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.119
 be so calm 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.209
 waiting for us to leave and nobody 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.920
 I knew nothing 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.580
 twice please do something here of 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 other than my partner they throw water and 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.819
 so good that lately the truth 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.130
 is that I am quite happy with the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.260
 channel I have with that channel with the other the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.260
 second channel in which you say that sum 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.690
 classes by ebro had practically 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.890
 most computer games and the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.060
 truth is that it has also reached 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.330
 500 ministers since it is practically 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.700
 just like this main channel and the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.959
 truth is that it happened super well in that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.930
 channel and in this channel then still 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.519
 also super happy because it 's not 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.410
 principle nothing has to always rise 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.940
 imagine yourself very rappers and I do not know how many 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.160
 months there were different games I started to 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.870

 willy that hinders is the one that most 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.819
 remember we want to add more says 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.310

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.079

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.900
 Careless game has been going up and everything

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.860
 do not continue to like it is that I do not know how to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.380
 I managed to 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.300
 I do not know that there is more variety in the channel 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.040
 but at the same time that you like it, we were not going 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.900

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.970

 put catch and put me up 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.880
 I know what I know because I know it's not 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.860
 a type of game that the public likes 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.080
 I have not but I know that there 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.640
 things that go quite a while that are 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.770
 different types of game before 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.870
 give us warfare 3 has to be all the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.730
 while videos talking about techniques or 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.530
 tactics like about improve now is 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.690

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.860
 let's say a lot of things 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.690
 different and the truth is that I'm 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.480
 super happy with that 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.580
 - Starting super good and good too 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.350
 that's what we are part of 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.359
 obviously because you are the ones who say that 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.720
 I like you the way I like it and the truth is that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.190
 as I tell you quite pretty happy 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.080
 especially about how good there are many people 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.880
 that is giving me the super white is 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.160
 that when you come few people because they are 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.870
 those who do not know that I have the other channel 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.880
 on another channel where in my boom my line 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.810
 things but good now always 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.020
 where are you watching 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.550
 all this we have seeing to kill 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.950
 this right now that we were going to 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.020
 win between people goes away suddenly 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.980
 half of the world disappears 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.240
 just a level 1 that I at a level 1 does not 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.980
 I may be killed because the wrong 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.230
 then over here I say be pulled me out 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.639
 we're going to wait a bit we're going to 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.590
 put you have to kill for a while 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.910
 yesterday to flag so I already knew that I 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.620
 he basically controlled what he wanted 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.510
 last the game but here suddenly 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.070
 as if not only one poor person remains 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.050
 boy that is level a half a bit of 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.470
 penilla taxis will be running 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.750
 deliver the flag as a man let's go 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.880
 to make him suffer and here you see me a plan 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.020
 super epic the truth is that waiting for 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.210
 see who played in the package and 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.470
 just when when he touched him between 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.880
 that the flag so good this has 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.680
 been everything I always wanted to thank 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.990
 I just wanted to teach a little bit of 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.030
 this game mode a lot of things 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.680
 thought and nothing still I still a little 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.960
 quite here, cover with the wave 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.430
 just removed more than the voice gave me in 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.169
 throat and it's a little cold but 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.360
 well what I said I hope you liked this 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.260

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.260
 days
