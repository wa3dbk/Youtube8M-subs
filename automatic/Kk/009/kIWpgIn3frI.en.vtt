00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
issue the pier is that this is much this

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.670 
issue the pier is that this is much this
is<00:04:10.190> much<00:04:10.400> larger<00:04:10.930> than<00:04:11.930> these<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:12.440> we're<00:04:12.590> going

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
is much larger than these so we're going

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.070 
is much larger than these so we're going
to<00:04:12.740> have<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.130> grab<00:04:13.520> hold<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.910> these<00:04:14.060> with<00:04:14.900> some
