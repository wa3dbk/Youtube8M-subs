in Chicago that's been making

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.010 
in Chicago that's been making
transformers<00:02:18.210> since<00:02:18.840> 1949<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:20.690> lot<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:21.930> we

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
transformers since 1949 a lot of what we

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.290 
transformers since 1949 a lot of what we
try<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.650> marry<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> old<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.790> new

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
try to do is marry the old and the new

try to do is marry the old and the new
you<00:02:24.390> know<00:02:24.510> select<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.960> things<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.350> like<00:02:25.530> about

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
you know select the things we like about

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.030 
you know select the things we like about
classic<00:02:26.400> amps<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:27.870> try<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.920> of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
classic amps and then try out some of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.130 
classic amps and then try out some of
the<00:02:29.100> new<00:02:29.250> components<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.240> exist<00:02:30.390> today<00:02:30.780> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the new components that exist today and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.550 
the new components that exist today and
see<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.830> take<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.250> step<00:02:32.670> forward<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
see if we can take a step forward in the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680 
see if we can take a step forward in the
amps<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.980> power<00:02:35.160> supply<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.640> very<00:02:36.240> important

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
amps the power supply is very important

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
amps the power supply is very important
that's<00:02:36.810> what<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.680> feeds<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.130> amp

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that's what really feeds the amp

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.190 
that's what really feeds the amp
electricity<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.150> sense<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.630> converts<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
electricity in a sense and converts the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.030 
electricity in a sense and converts the
guitar<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:42.090> sound<00:02:42.330> even<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.710> want

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
guitar to to sound even here I just want

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.220 
guitar to to sound even here I just want
to<00:02:44.070> show<00:02:44.220> these<00:02:44.430> filter<00:02:45.240> caps<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.660> use<00:02:45.930> are

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
to show these filter caps we use are

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500 
to show these filter caps we use are
polypropylene<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:48.180> were<00:02:48.360> designed

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
polypropylene and these were designed

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.340 
polypropylene and these were designed
for<00:02:48.750> satellites<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.250> they<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> really

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
for satellites and they have a really

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:04.949 
for satellites and they have a really
fast

the<00:03:15.069> deluxe<00:03:15.370> reverb<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.510> great<00:03:16.900> example<00:03:17.319> of

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
the deluxe reverb is a great example of

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.220 
the deluxe reverb is a great example of
that<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:18.159> the<00:03:18.280> pine<00:03:18.719> plus<00:03:19.719> the<00:03:19.900> floating

that and the pine plus the floating

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
that and the pine plus the floating
baffle<00:03:20.409> seem<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.010> give<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> great

actually<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.660> know<00:04:39.780> put<00:04:40.169> speakers<00:04:40.440> in<00:04:40.620> reverb

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
actually you know put speakers in reverb

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.210 
actually you know put speakers in reverb
tanks<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:42.120> flashing<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.590> cabinets<00:04:44.070> and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
tanks just flashing to the cabinets and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.879 
tanks just flashing to the cabinets and
then<00:04:44.610> does<00:04:45.600> some<00:04:45.720> work<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.169> amplifiers<00:04:46.680> a

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
then does some work on the amplifiers a

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.250 
then does some work on the amplifiers a
little<00:04:47.400> extra<00:04:47.790> secure<00:04:48.389> gluing<00:04:48.810> we<00:04:48.930> put<00:04:49.139> in

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
little extra secure gluing we put in

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.990 
little extra secure gluing we put in
there<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.010> join<00:04:50.310> some<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.760> then<00:04:50.850> they're

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
there and join some and then they're

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.219 
there and join some and then they're
ready<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.620> final<00:04:52.620> listening<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:54.930> our

mysterious battle or two
so<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.710> basically<00:05:11.220> play<00:05:11.550> through<00:05:11.849> check<00:05:12.090> all

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
so I basically play through check all

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.629 
so I basically play through check all
the<00:05:12.389> settings<00:05:12.830> try<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.889> make<00:05:14.069> it<00:05:14.189> misbehave

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
all right this is our test bench after

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.589 
all right this is our test bench after
the<00:05:28.860> guys<00:05:29.039> make<00:05:29.430> an<00:05:29.610> amp

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
the guys make an amp

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.119 
the guys make an amp
one<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.169> fellows<00:05:31.469> goes<00:05:31.680> through<00:05:31.889> all<00:05:32.009> the

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
one of the fellows goes through all the

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.700 
one of the fellows goes through all the
solder<00:05:32.370> joints<00:05:32.909> and<00:05:33.479> then<00:05:33.810> slowly<00:05:34.110> powers<00:05:34.560> it

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
solder joints and then slowly powers it

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.469 
solder joints and then slowly powers it
up<00:05:34.830> make<00:05:35.159> sure<00:05:35.189> that<00:05:35.550> all<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.789> voltages<00:05:36.240> come

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
up make sure that all the voltages come

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.059 
up make sure that all the voltages come
up<00:05:36.629> the<00:05:36.750> way<00:05:36.870> we<00:05:37.050> like<00:05:37.259> and<00:05:37.530> everything<00:05:37.860> looks

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
up the way we like and everything looks

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.480

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
table and just leave the amp on for

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.879 
table and just leave the amp on for
about<00:05:53.280> 24<00:05:53.879> hours<00:05:53.939> and<00:05:54.419> then<00:05:55.289> I'll<00:05:55.469> come<00:05:55.680> along

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
about 24 hours and then I'll come along

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.950 
about 24 hours and then I'll come along
and<00:05:56.039> take<00:05:56.219> it<00:05:56.280> off<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.550> redo<00:05:57.270> all<00:05:57.419> those<00:05:57.599> tests

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.140 
and take it off and redo all those tests
and<00:05:58.110> they<00:05:58.259> they<00:05:58.590> all<00:05:58.800> involve<00:05:59.159> really<00:05:59.849> just

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
and they they all involve really just

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.629 
and they they all involve really just
making<00:06:00.689> sure<00:06:01.020> all<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:02.039> components<00:06:02.550> are

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
making sure all the components are

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.890 
making sure all the components are
working<00:06:02.939> right<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.270> then<00:06:03.389> playing<00:06:03.629> through

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
working right and then playing through

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.019 
working right and then playing through
so<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:05.279> sounds<00:06:05.610> good

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
so it sounds good

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:07.640 
so it sounds good

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
and then it goes into the other room

00:06:07.650 --> 00:07:03.559 
and then it goes into the other room
putting<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.639> cabinet
