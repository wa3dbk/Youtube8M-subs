00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.700
 preparation 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.900

 then in this field a lot of time and money 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.580
 but how many desnogorsk what 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.040
 that's what went on far from 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.110
 for educational process 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.220
 but I like the new learning process 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.920
 times 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.020
 almost every house has a computer 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.110
 Kaas Internet, even a first grader for a long time 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.840
 you had a harder time for teachers 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.230
 At first they really liked 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.200
 amnesty will get all caught 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.280
 percentage but then it was 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.290
 found here that it won't work for me 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.399
 that it can happen to all 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.749
 but it never canceled 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.030
 it turned out at all 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.930
 new teaching methods work with 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.549
 the beginning of the school year 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.479
 took only the best 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.149
 despite the fact that now is so big 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.359
 value is given all the same here 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.939

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.269
 first place 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.359
 in the first place is a second relapse 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.989
 they are the discoverer in the field 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.919

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.889
 internet based process 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.879
