00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.660 
the eyebrows and the nose area Sarge
when<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.799> get<00:01:42.979> good<00:01:43.100> base<00:01:43.310> going<00:01:43.670> first

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.310 

so<00:01:50.670> once<00:01:51.000> I've<00:01:51.180> done<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> take

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
so once I've done that I'm going to take

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.140 
so once I've done that I'm going to take
some<00:01:52.650> regular<00:01:53.010> tissue<00:01:53.250> paper<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.790> I've<00:01:53.880> torn

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
some regular tissue paper that I've torn

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.760 
some regular tissue paper that I've torn
into<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.750> I've<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.080> thinner<00:01:55.260> halves<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
into so I've got the thinner halves and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950 
into so I've got the thinner halves and
the<00:01:56.100> idea<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.580> work<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.150> little<00:01:57.660> strips

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the idea is to work with little strips

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.719 
the idea is to work with little strips
at<00:01:58.140> times<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.250> bigger<00:01:59.430> than<00:01:59.520> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
at times and not much bigger than that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
at times and not much bigger than that
so<00:01:59.970> I'm<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.260> I'm<00:02:01.410> going<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so I'm going to for now I'm going to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.710 
so I'm going to for now I'm going to
work<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.220> eyebrows<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:02.940> Feldman's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
work on my eyebrows because Feldman's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.359 
work on my eyebrows because Feldman's
got<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.020> pronounced<00:02:04.530> brow<00:02:04.890> isn't<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.250> that's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
got so pronounced brow isn't it that's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.770 
got so pronounced brow isn't it that's
very<00:02:05.430> straight<00:02:05.850> across<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.330> not<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.570> much

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
very straight across it's not as much

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.139 
very straight across it's not as much
not<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:06.990> angry<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.650> more<00:02:07.910> straight<00:02:08.910> across

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
not so angry it's more straight across

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
not so angry it's more straight across
and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:10.050> slightly<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.740> it's<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.130> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and then down slightly so it's more of a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.610 
and then down slightly so it's more of a
sad<00:02:11.430> expression<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.530> to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
sad expression and so I'm just going to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.260 
sad expression and so I'm just going to
build<00:02:13.770> up<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.070> area<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.730> slightly

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
build up this area here and slightly

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.120 
build up this area here and slightly
downwards<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> idea<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.620> cover<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
downwards so the idea is to cover the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.790 
downwards so the idea is to cover the
area<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.400> latex<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.420> we'll<00:02:18.660> push<00:02:18.959> some<00:02:19.530> tissue

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
area in latex and we'll push some tissue

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.010 
area in latex and we'll push some tissue
down<00:02:20.310> over<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> top<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.720> take<00:02:21.870> my

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
down over the top of that and take my

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.630 
down over the top of that and take my
sponge<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> latex<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.190> saturate

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
sponge in the latex and just saturate

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.880 
sponge in the latex and just saturate
that<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:24.900> going<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.110> build<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.500> whole

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
that so I'm going to build up this whole

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.699 
that so I'm going to build up this whole
area<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.940> about<00:02:27.150> five<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.140> six<00:02:28.320> coats

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
area here for about five to six coats

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.280 
area here for about five to six coats
and<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.760> drying<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.690> push<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and as it's drying I can push it in the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.479 
and as it's drying I can push it in the
direction<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.680> want<00:02:31.920> which<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.190> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> be

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
direction I want which is going to be

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.240 
direction I want which is going to be
pushing<00:02:33.330> down<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.530> make<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
pushing down here to make so the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.590 
pushing down here to make so the
opposite<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.910> pushing<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> middle

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
opposite of pushing in the middle

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.729 
opposite of pushing in the middle
because<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.870> don't<00:02:37.050> want<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> look<00:02:37.380> angry

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
because you don't want it to look angry

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.600 
because you don't want it to look angry
you<00:02:37.830> want<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.130> look<00:02:38.280> more<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.730> said<00:02:38.910> sad

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.840 

so<00:02:46.540> there<00:02:46.690> we<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.290> not<00:02:47.800> quite<00:02:48.040> angry<00:02:48.730> I'm

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so there we are so not quite angry I'm

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.370 
so there we are so not quite angry I'm
gonna<00:02:49.030> push<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.420> ever<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.750> slightly<00:02:50.080> down

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
gonna push the ever so slightly down

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.020 
gonna push the ever so slightly down
here<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.860> make<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.220> tiny<00:02:51.460> bit<00:02:51.580> furrowed

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
here just to make it a tiny bit furrowed

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.060 
here just to make it a tiny bit furrowed
but<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.570> more<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.780> I've<00:02:53.110> pushed<00:02:53.440> on<00:02:53.830> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
attention is drawn to the middle of the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.130 
attention is drawn to the middle of the
face<00:03:03.520> with<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.880> eyes<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.390> nose<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:04.900> yeah

so speaking of the nose that's the next

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.730 
so speaking of the nose that's the next
day<00:03:07.150> I'm<00:03:07.240> going<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> start<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.230> obviously<00:03:08.680> I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
day I'm going to start on so obviously I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.050 
day I'm going to start on so obviously I
can't<00:03:08.950> block<00:03:09.100> when<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.250> was<00:03:09.370> out<00:03:09.460> completely

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
can't block when I was out completely

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.130 
can't block when I was out completely
like<00:03:10.240> I<00:03:10.270> couldn't<00:03:10.540> do<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.900> film

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
like I couldn't do it in the film

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.440 
like I couldn't do it in the film
because<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:12.190> near<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.730> impossible<00:03:12.970> they<00:03:13.330> had

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
because it's near on impossible they had

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.200 
because it's near on impossible they had
to<00:03:13.600> use<00:03:13.630> CGI<00:03:14.170> but<00:03:14.860> I'm<00:03:15.190> gonna<00:03:15.460> try<00:03:15.670> my<00:03:15.850> best<00:03:16.030> I'm

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
to use CGI but I'm gonna try my best I'm

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.400 
to use CGI but I'm gonna try my best I'm
gonna<00:03:16.300> do<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> very<00:03:16.570> similar<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.960> my<00:03:17.050> smiling

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
gonna do a very similar to my smiling

gonna do a very similar to my smiling
makeup<00:03:17.830> I'm<00:03:17.980> gonna<00:03:18.130> use<00:03:18.250> some<00:03:18.400> masking<00:03:18.550> tape

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
makeup I'm gonna use some masking tape

and<00:03:19.260> I'm<00:03:20.260> going<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.670> make<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.210> there's

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
and I'm going to make it so that there's

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360 
and I'm going to make it so that there's
a<00:03:22.450> slight<00:03:22.630> Ridge<00:03:23.140> that's<00:03:23.770> as<00:03:23.980> close<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:24.310> I'm

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
a slight Ridge that's as close as I'm

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.410 
a slight Ridge that's as close as I'm
gonna<00:03:24.520> get<00:03:24.700> because<00:03:24.850> I've<00:03:25.030> am<00:03:25.180> basically

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
gonna get because I've am basically

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.270 
gonna get because I've am basically
gonna<00:03:25.600> join<00:03:25.900> my<00:03:26.140> bridge<00:03:26.320> my<00:03:26.500> nose<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.950> my<00:03:27.070> top

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
gonna join my bridge my nose to my top

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.130 
gonna join my bridge my nose to my top
lip<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:28.180> still<00:03:28.360> gonna<00:03:28.480> be<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.630> bump<00:03:28.870> which

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
lip so it's still gonna be a bump which

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.840 
lip so it's still gonna be a bump which
there<00:03:29.350> kind<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.770> in<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.920> film<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:30.670> there's

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
there kind of is in the film but there's

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.920 
there kind of is in the film but there's
no<00:03:31.000> getting<00:03:31.300> away<00:03:31.390> from<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.780> really

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
no getting away from that really

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.720 
no getting away from that really
unfortunately<00:03:32.440> hopefully<00:03:32.770> on<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.190> profile

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
unfortunately hopefully on the profile

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.610 
unfortunately hopefully on the profile
will<00:03:33.940> look<00:03:33.970> quite<00:03:34.209> good<00:03:34.450> from<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.720> side<00:03:34.930> maybe

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
will look quite good from the side maybe

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.070 
will look quite good from the side maybe
not<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:35.980> good<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:36.940> guys<00:03:37.060> how<00:03:37.300> well

not so good it's up to you guys how well
happy<00:03:38.320> keynote<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.740> suppose<00:03:39.040> yeah<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:40.480> yes<00:03:40.930> I'm

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
happy keynote is suppose yeah so yes I'm

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.530 
happy keynote is suppose yeah so yes I'm
going<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.230> start<00:03:41.470> by<00:03:41.680> applying<00:03:42.180> maybe<00:03:43.180> to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
going to start by applying maybe to

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.510 
going to start by applying maybe to
three<00:03:43.810> strips<00:03:44.050> of<00:03:44.140> latex<00:03:44.470> around<00:03:44.590> my<00:03:44.980> nose<00:03:45.130> to

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
three strips of latex around my nose to

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.370 
three strips of latex around my nose to
the<00:03:45.640> latex<00:03:46.150> base<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.870> then<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.020> can<00:03:47.170> start

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
the latex base and then I can start

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:58.020 
the latex base and then I can start
typing<00:03:47.530> in<00:03:47.830> some<00:03:48.010> latex

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.369 

so<00:03:59.030> there<00:03:59.180> we<00:03:59.299> are<00:03:59.329> so<00:03:59.569> after<00:03:59.870> the<00:03:59.989> initial

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
so there we are so after the initial

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.259 
so there we are so after the initial
free<00:04:00.680> trips<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.430> tapes<00:04:01.640> at<00:04:01.849> one<00:04:02.030> going

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
free trips of tapes at one going

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.970 
free trips of tapes at one going
vertically<00:04:02.659> than<00:04:02.930> two<00:04:03.140> going<00:04:03.379> horizontally<00:04:03.950> I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
vertically than two going horizontally I

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.399 
vertically than two going horizontally I
was<00:04:04.129> able<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.340> build<00:04:04.579> a<00:04:04.700> bridge<00:04:04.939> with<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:06.200> tape

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
was able to build a bridge with the tape

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.710 
was able to build a bridge with the tape
so<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.860> more<00:04:07.040> tape<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.459> applied<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:08.060> smoother

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
so the more tape I applied the smoother

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.649 
so the more tape I applied the smoother
this<00:04:08.810> area<00:04:09.200> got<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.739> I've<00:04:09.860> gone<00:04:10.069> for<00:04:11.060> every<00:04:11.329> one

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
this area got so I've gone for every one

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.210 
this area got so I've gone for every one
that<00:04:11.810> I've<00:04:11.930> gone<00:04:12.079> down<00:04:12.290> I've<00:04:12.470> gone<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.890> across

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
that I've gone down I've gone to across

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.740 
that I've gone down I've gone to across
so<00:04:13.489> one<00:04:13.730> down<00:04:13.909> and<00:04:14.090> two<00:04:14.150> across<00:04:14.450> one<00:04:14.599> cut

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
so one down and two across one cut

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.689 
so one down and two across one cut
across<00:04:15.079> until<00:04:15.650> I've<00:04:15.799> got<00:04:16.010> this<00:04:16.220> shape<00:04:16.459> so

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
across until I've got this shape so

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.490 
across until I've got this shape so
obviously<00:04:17.419> it's<00:04:17.570> not<00:04:17.720> done<00:04:17.989> yet<00:04:18.229> but<00:04:18.380> I'm

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
obviously it's not done yet but I'm

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.039 
obviously it's not done yet but I'm
starting<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:18.859> lose<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.639> this<00:04:20.419> ridge<00:04:20.690> here

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
starting to lose the this ridge here

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.469 
starting to lose the this ridge here
mainly<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:22.190> now<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.580> need<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.820> smooth<00:04:23.180> out<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
mainly so now I need to smooth out the

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.610 
mainly so now I need to smooth out the
tape<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:23.930> I'm<00:04:23.990> gonna<00:04:24.080> take<00:04:24.199> some<00:04:24.260> more<00:04:24.500> liquid

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
tape so I'm gonna take some more liquid

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.100 
tape so I'm gonna take some more liquid
latex<00:04:25.010> apply<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.880> over<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.330> tissue<00:04:26.750> for<00:04:26.990> about

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
latex apply it over the tissue for about

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.420 
latex apply it over the tissue for about
two<00:04:27.320> coats<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.650> then<00:04:27.800> do<00:04:27.919> exactly<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.400> same

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
two coats and then do exactly the same

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.580 
two coats and then do exactly the same
as<00:04:28.580> what<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.789> did<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.120> my<00:04:29.180> forehead<00:04:29.990> with<00:04:30.320> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
as what I did on my forehead with the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.850 
as what I did on my forehead with the
tissue<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.370> I'll<00:04:31.870> turn<00:04:32.870> latex<00:04:33.530> interest-rate

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
tissue so I'll turn latex interest-rate

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.529 
tissue so I'll turn latex interest-rate
it's<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.310> tissue<00:04:34.550> for<00:04:34.760> about<00:04:34.910> four<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.510> five

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
it's in tissue for about four to five

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.590 
it's in tissue for about four to five
coats<00:04:36.080> until<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:37.070> area<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.340> completely

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
coats until the area is completely

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.140 
coats until the area is completely
smooth<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.840> there's<00:04:38.960> no<00:04:39.080> edge

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.940 

there<00:04:43.210> we<00:04:43.270> go<00:04:43.420> I've<00:04:44.080> left<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:44.410> area<00:04:44.650> here

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
there we go I've left this area here

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.500 
there we go I've left this area here
clear<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.400> most<00:04:45.640> of<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.880> latex<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.390> issue

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
clear of most of the latex and issue

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.420 
clear of most of the latex and issue
just<00:04:46.840> so<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:46.990> can<00:04:47.140> speak<00:04:47.560> without<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.130> edges

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
just so I can speak without the edges

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.250 
just so I can speak without the edges
lifting<00:04:48.760> up<00:04:48.880> although<00:04:49.180> I'm<00:04:49.780> going<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.110> switch

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
lifting up although I'm going to switch

over<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.590> voiceover<00:04:50.950> now<00:04:51.250> just<00:04:51.550> because<00:04:51.940> I

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
over to a voiceover now just because I

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.600 
over to a voiceover now just because I
sound<00:04:53.050> ringing<00:04:53.200> really<00:04:53.710> nasally<00:04:54.220> whenever<00:04:54.520> I

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
sound ringing really nasally whenever I

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.270 
sound ringing really nasally whenever I
close<00:04:54.880> my<00:04:55.690> nose<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.170> I<00:04:56.830> want<00:04:57.010> you<00:04:57.070> guys<00:04:57.130> to

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.570 
understand as much as possible so yes
I'll<00:04:59.380> switch<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.680> voiceover<00:05:00.130> now<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.520> to

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
I'll switch to voiceover now just to

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.820 
I'll switch to voiceover now just to
make<00:05:00.700> things<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:00.970> bit<00:05:01.030> clearer<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:02.500> for<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
make things a bit clearer so for the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.080 
make things a bit clearer so for the
foundation<00:05:03.370> I'm<00:05:03.550> going<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.730> be<00:05:03.790> using<00:05:04.000> a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
foundation I'm going to be using a

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.910 
foundation I'm going to be using a
snazaroo<00:05:04.360> clown<00:05:04.930> white<00:05:05.260> then<00:05:05.620> we'll<00:05:05.740> powder

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
snazaroo clown white then we'll powder

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:13.060 
snazaroo clown white then we'll powder
all<00:05:06.160> over<00:05:06.190> my<00:05:06.520> face<00:05:06.790> neck<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.390> is

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.240 

then<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.000> took<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.570> barium<00:05:15.140> number-6<00:05:15.800> blue

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
then I took a barium number-6 blue

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.280 
then I took a barium number-6 blue
eyeliner<00:05:16.790> pencil<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.540> I<00:05:17.600> used<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.110> draw

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
eyeliner pencil and I used that to draw

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.350 
eyeliner pencil and I used that to draw
on<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.710> kind<00:05:19.340> of<00:05:19.400> light<00:05:19.610> there<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.880> veins<00:05:20.120> but

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
on the kind of light there the veins but

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.120 
on the kind of light there the veins but
they're<00:05:20.450> kind<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.630> like<00:05:20.690> tree<00:05:21.020> roots<00:05:21.350> so<00:05:21.890> I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
they're kind of like tree roots so I

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.590 
they're kind of like tree roots so I
pressed<00:05:22.460> really<00:05:22.670> heavily<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.150> back<00:05:23.330> at<00:05:23.510> the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
pressed really heavily the back at the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600 
pressed really heavily the back at the
head<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:23.900> then<00:05:23.990> taper<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.680> roots<00:05:24.890> out<00:05:25.160> toward

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
head and then taper the roots out toward

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.580 
head and then taper the roots out toward
the<00:05:25.670> center<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.090> face<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:26.540> did<00:05:26.960> this<00:05:27.050> on<00:05:27.290> the

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
the center of the face I did this on the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.740 
the center of the face I did this on the
top<00:05:27.980> of<00:05:28.100> my<00:05:28.190> head<00:05:28.400> near<00:05:28.850> my<00:05:28.970> ears<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.390> under<00:05:29.630> my

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
top of my head near my ears and under my

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.060 
top of my head near my ears and under my
chin<00:05:29.960> as<00:05:30.110> well<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.710> doesn't<00:05:30.890> matter

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
chin as well it doesn't matter

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.560 
chin as well it doesn't matter
particularly<00:05:31.490> what<00:05:31.760> pattern<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:32.150> goes<00:05:32.300> in<00:05:32.450> as

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
particularly what pattern it goes in as

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.690 
particularly what pattern it goes in as
long<00:05:32.660> as<00:05:32.750> it's<00:05:32.870> very<00:05:33.050> veiny<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:34.280> comes

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
long as it's very veiny and the comes

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.880 
long as it's very veiny and the comes
off<00:05:34.850> like<00:05:35.030> each<00:05:35.480> each<00:05:35.840> spike<00:05:36.260> has<00:05:36.530> its<00:05:36.710> own

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
off like each each spike has its own

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.890 
off like each each spike has its own
little<00:05:37.250> tree<00:05:37.550> root<00:05:37.760> that<00:05:37.880> comes<00:05:38.090> off<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.450> it

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
little tree root that comes off it it

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.360 
little tree root that comes off it it
just<00:05:39.080> is<00:05:39.350> better<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.860> it<00:05:39.920> isn't<00:05:40.130> symmetrical

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
just is better that it isn't symmetrical

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.100 
just is better that it isn't symmetrical
as<00:05:40.700> well<00:05:40.880> just<00:05:41.360> try<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.600> press<00:05:41.750> it<00:05:41.840> as<00:05:41.930> light

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
as well just try and press it as light

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.380 
as well just try and press it as light
as<00:05:42.260> possible<00:05:42.620> as<00:05:42.710> you<00:05:42.770> taper<00:05:43.010> off<00:05:43.250> then<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.150> went

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
as possible as you taper off then I went

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.390 
as possible as you taper off then I went
in<00:05:44.510> with<00:05:44.630> another<00:05:44.900> two<00:05:45.170> eyeliner<00:05:45.590> pencils<00:05:46.070> in

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
in with another two eyeliner pencils in

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.550 
in with another two eyeliner pencils in
a<00:05:46.670> light<00:05:46.910> purple<00:05:47.270> which<00:05:47.540> is<00:05:47.570> number<00:05:47.960> fifteen

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
a light purple which is number fifteen

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
a light purple which is number fifteen
by<00:05:48.770> barium<00:05:49.160> and<00:05:49.340> number<00:05:50.270> 79<00:05:50.900> by<00:05:51.590> prestige<00:05:52.160> it's

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
by barium and number 79 by prestige it's

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.570 
by barium and number 79 by prestige it's
a<00:05:52.910> dark<00:05:53.360> purple<00:05:53.840> just<00:05:54.230> add<00:05:54.350> a<00:05:54.410> bit<00:05:54.500> more

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
a dark purple just add a bit more

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.860 
a dark purple just add a bit more
dimension<00:05:55.580> in<00:05:55.940> there<00:05:56.090> just<00:05:56.180> so<00:05:56.330> it's<00:05:56.480> not<00:05:56.570> one

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
dimension in there just so it's not one

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.450 
dimension in there just so it's not one
block<00:05:57.110> color<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:57.770> I<00:05:57.830> did<00:05:57.980> exactly<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.430> same

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
block color and I did exactly the same

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.070 
block color and I did exactly the same
thing<00:05:58.700> again<00:05:58.790> just<00:05:59.180> so<00:05:59.480> some<00:05:59.840> of<00:05:59.870> them<00:06:00.020> were

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
thing again just so some of them were

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.040 
thing again just so some of them were
overlapping<00:06:00.550> in<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.610> same<00:06:01.820> pattern<00:06:02.060> then<00:06:02.960> I

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
overlapping in the same pattern then I

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.010 
overlapping in the same pattern then I
took<00:06:03.110> a<00:06:03.500> grimace<00:06:03.800> black<00:06:04.160> cream<00:06:04.520> in<00:06:04.760> 1:01<00:06:05.660> and<00:06:05.930> I

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
took a grimace black cream in 1:01 and I

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.630 
took a grimace black cream in 1:01 and I
used<00:06:06.230> that<00:06:06.320> just<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.770> shape<00:06:07.040> the<00:06:07.220> eyes<00:06:07.340> a<00:06:07.370> bit

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
used that just to shape the eyes a bit

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.940 
used that just to shape the eyes a bit
better<00:06:07.790> so<00:06:08.360> I<00:06:08.390> went<00:06:08.810> in<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.230> crease<00:06:09.620> of<00:06:09.890> my

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
better so I went in the crease of my

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.670 
better so I went in the crease of my
eyes<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.700> I<00:06:11.360> went<00:06:11.630> ever<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.020> slightly<00:06:12.410> up

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
eyes and I went ever so slightly up

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.700 
eyes and I went ever so slightly up
towards<00:06:13.280> the<00:06:13.370> brow<00:06:14.030> furrow<00:06:14.390> just<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:14.960> make<00:06:15.530> it

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
towards the brow furrow just to make it

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.670 
towards the brow furrow just to make it
look<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:16.220> tiny<00:06:16.760> bit<00:06:17.060> angry<00:06:17.420> and<00:06:17.780> a<00:06:17.930> bit<00:06:18.050> sad<00:06:18.500> at

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
look a tiny bit angry and a bit sad at

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.040 
look a tiny bit angry and a bit sad at
the<00:06:18.770> same<00:06:18.800> time<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:20.420> also<00:06:20.540> pulled<00:06:20.870> the

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
the same time and I also pulled the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.630 
the same time and I also pulled the
color<00:06:21.260> down<00:06:21.470> under<00:06:21.860> the<00:06:21.980> eyes<00:06:22.100> as<00:06:22.280> well<00:06:22.400> just

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
color down under the eyes as well just

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.850 
color down under the eyes as well just
to<00:06:22.790> draw<00:06:23.030> in<00:06:23.210> the<00:06:23.360> eye<00:06:23.390> bags<00:06:23.810> that<00:06:24.050> he<00:06:24.170> has<00:06:24.350> they

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
to draw in the eye bags that he has they

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.950 
to draw in the eye bags that he has they
don't<00:06:25.010> quite<00:06:25.250> meet<00:06:25.460> in<00:06:25.850> the<00:06:26.000> middle<00:06:26.120> they<00:06:26.750> just

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
don't quite meet in the middle they just

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.020 
don't quite meet in the middle they just
go<00:06:27.140> from<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:28.130> teared<00:06:28.400> out<00:06:28.490> in<00:06:28.670> the<00:06:28.730> corner<00:06:28.970> of

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
go from the teared out in the corner of

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.000 
go from the teared out in the corner of
your<00:06:29.120> eye<00:06:29.240> just<00:06:29.510> down<00:06:30.170> slightly<00:06:30.560> under<00:06:30.890> the

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
your eye just down slightly under the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.460 
your eye just down slightly under the
eye<00:06:31.040> and<00:06:31.340> I<00:06:32.210> blended<00:06:32.540> that<00:06:32.600> out<00:06:32.720> as<00:06:33.110> well<00:06:33.230> just

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
eye and I blended that out as well just
