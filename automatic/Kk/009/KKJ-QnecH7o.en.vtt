00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello friends good friends today I will make you a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.649
 top 5 of the best firearms in the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.510
 et force of 2 but before seeing this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.300
 video I want you to know that this cap is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.940
 just a good opinion of mine let's start 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.090
 quickly with the top 5 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.020
 in the top 5 is the fn rifle 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.240
 scar with 60 bullets and 360 ammunition 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.280
 it is a very fast weapon and with very good 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.190
 aim your recharge time is 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.920
 average the disadvantage of this weapon is 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.860
 that is little powerful needs three shots 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.200
 to kill a reggaeton zombie and the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.379
 They spent ammunition quickly as 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.620
 spend three bullets per shot let's see 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.620
 we go 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.270
 in the top 4 we have the military rifle or 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.330
 military sniper with 30 bullets and 180 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.730
 ammunition is a very powerful weapon and with 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.790
 good accuracy your recharge time is 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.860
 a bit slow the disadvantage of the sniper 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.810
 military is that when it comes to running your 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.990
 marksmanship is affected a lot by making 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 the shots go anywhere 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.350
 this weapon will last you for a long 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.270
 time since it's like the shotgun 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.450
 semiautomatic and it will not make you spend 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.220
 many bullets plus with this weapon you can 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.590
 kill a week from a distance 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.479
 far away shooting him in the head several 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.050
 let's see 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.050
 let's see 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.849
 top 3 is the famous m16 rifle with 50 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 bullets and 360 ammunition is a very useful weapon 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.459
 effective fast and with very good aim 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.470
 your recharge time is fast and the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.860
 time to run the aim will affect a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.860
 little bit 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.410
 I want to search 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.990
 already 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.769
 all the powerful and reliable shotgun 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.420
 with 10 bullets and 90 ammunition this weapon 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.590
 she deserves her position for being good 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.630
 powerful fast and reliable advantages to the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.440
 time to run your aim will not change 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.320
 nothing very good in close combat you can 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.330
 kill a few weeks easily you can 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.750
 free an incapacitated partner 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.780
 easily disadvantages has a 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.840
 long-range aim bad weather 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.150
 slow recharge but still the shotgun 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.150
 he deserves his position let's see 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.030
 do not 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.500
 h 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.240

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.780

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.669
 we finally get to the top number 1 we have 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.490
 to the reliable gun with 15 bullets 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.699

 fast and powerful hunter rifle or point 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.320
 incredible with 15 bullets and 150 ammunition 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.150
 despite its size and its capacity to 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.220
 ammunition is the strongest weapon in 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.740
 all maybe some say no such 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.870
