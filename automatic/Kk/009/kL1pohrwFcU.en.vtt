00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
made a variance where we are allowed to

made a variance where we are allowed to
do<00:00:15.120> 75%<00:00:16.049> xeriscape<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.859> 25%<00:00:17.730> sod<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.600> could<00:00:19.260> not

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439

do 75% xeriscape and 25% sod I could not
be<00:00:19.650> more<00:00:19.680> thrilled<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> outcome<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
be more thrilled with the outcome and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.099 
be more thrilled with the outcome and
early<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> video<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.310> was

real early in the season so it was kind

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.009

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
about the fact that people think stone

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
about the fact that people think stone
is<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.809> cold<00:00:55.079> looking<00:00:55.530> frankly<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.340> don't

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
is a little cold looking frankly I don't

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
is a little cold looking frankly I don't
understand<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:58.260> set<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.070> before<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
understand it I don't set it before I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
understand it I don't set it before I
have<00:01:00.059> never<00:01:00.239> seen<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> set<00:01:00.809> by<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> riverbed<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
have never seen it set by a riverbed and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.810 
have never seen it set by a riverbed and
thought<00:01:02.219> wow<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.820> looks<00:01:03.439> you<00:01:04.439> know

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820

so<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.799> disagree<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> statement<00:01:08.130> I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so I disagree with that statement I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.969 
so I disagree with that statement I
think<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.790> stone<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.540> beautiful

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
think that stone is actually a beautiful

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
think that stone is actually a beautiful
way<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.030> playing<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.210> different<00:01:12.330> colors<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
way of playing with different colors and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.880 
way of playing with different colors and
textures<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> landscape

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
textures in the landscape

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.950 
textures in the landscape
and<00:01:14.979> you<00:01:15.460> see<00:01:15.670> again<00:01:15.790> how<00:01:16.240> beautifully<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
and you see again how beautifully the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.590 
and you see again how beautifully the
contrast<00:01:17.440> between<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.890> green<00:01:18.190> grass<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.970> have

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
contrast between that green grass I have

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.960 
contrast between that green grass I have
reduced<00:01:19.990> my<00:01:20.409> nuisance<00:01:20.740> strip<00:01:21.070> or<00:01:21.400> death<00:01:21.640> strip

Riverrock<00:02:14.080> instead<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.310> grass<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:15.700> we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
Riverrock instead of the grass that we

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.180 
Riverrock instead of the grass that we
previously<00:02:16.000> had<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:17.410> keep<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.830> going

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
previously had so we just keep on going

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.560 
previously had so we just keep on going
all<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.459> way<00:02:18.489> down<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.120> see<00:02:19.329> how

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
beautiful this goes all the way my

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.160 
beautiful this goes all the way my
mailbox<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.940> when<00:02:22.120> people<00:02:22.269> come<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
mailbox so when people come this is the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.140 
mailbox so when people come this is the
vision<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.620> they<00:02:23.890> get<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.280> experience

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
vision that they get to experience

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.780 
vision that they get to experience
instead<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.870> your<00:02:25.989> half-dead<00:02:26.410> grass<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
instead of your half-dead grass and the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.039 
instead of your half-dead grass and the
amount<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.090> water<00:02:28.329> down<00:02:28.600> here<00:02:28.900> is

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
amount of water down here is

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.430 
amount of water down here is
extraordinarily<00:02:29.700> reduced<00:02:30.700> by<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.930> obviously

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
extraordinarily reduced by one obviously

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.199 
extraordinarily reduced by one obviously
adding<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> rock<00:02:33.040> instead<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.700> sod<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
adding the rock instead of the sod and

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.229 
adding the rock instead of the sod and
secondly<00:02:35.019> by<00:02:35.290> using<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:36.100> correct<00:02:36.370> plants<00:02:37.030> I

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
secondly by using the correct plants I

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.060 
secondly by using the correct plants I
will<00:02:37.780> speak<00:02:37.989> on<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.290> over<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.769> over<00:02:38.980> again
