shim that will fit right there use a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.480 
shim that will fit right there use a
little<00:01:56.969> super<00:01:57.240> glue<00:01:57.390> stick<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:59.040> fix

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
little super glue stick it in and fix

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.800 
little super glue stick it in and fix

this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.580> DVD<00:02:24.940> drive<00:02:25.180> once<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.720> taken

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
this is the DVD drive once it's taken

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.740 
this is the DVD drive once it's taken
out<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.650> covers<00:02:26.980> are<00:02:27.100> removed<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:28.720> I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
out the covers are removed and what I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.370 
out the covers are removed and what I
would<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.440> stand<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.770> up<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.040> end<00:02:30.220> like

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
would do is just stand it up on end like

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.680 
would do is just stand it up on end like
this<00:02:32.460> actually<00:02:34.440> turn<00:02:35.440> around<00:02:35.740> like<00:02:35.830> this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
this actually turn around like this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.710 
this actually turn around like this
because<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> part<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.170> want<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:39.720> is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
because the part you want to get to is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.790 
because the part you want to get to is
right<00:02:40.930> there<00:02:41.760> what's<00:02:42.760> happening<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
right there what's happening is the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.040 
right there what's happening is the
laser<00:02:45.520> is<00:02:46.390> sliding<00:02:46.720> back<00:02:47.050> too<00:02:47.380> far<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:49.050> it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
laser is sliding back too far and it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.120 
laser is sliding back too far and it
gets<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.410> from<00:02:50.590> underneath<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:52.530> DVD<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.890> it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
gets out from underneath the DVD so it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.710 
gets out from underneath the DVD so it
doesn't<00:02:54.459> think<00:02:54.580> there's<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.910> DVD<00:02:55.060> there<00:02:55.480> or<00:02:55.690> a

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
doesn't think there's a DVD there or a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.640 
doesn't think there's a DVD there or a
game<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:58.000> can't<00:02:58.270> see<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:59.260> mush<00:02:59.470> down

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
game you can't see it the mush down

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.670 
game you can't see it the mush down
that's<00:02:59.860> right<00:02:59.950> there<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.850> clear<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.590> you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
that's right there it's clear so you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.600 
that's right there it's clear so you
can't<00:03:02.890> even<00:03:03.010> tell<00:03:03.160> us<00:03:03.220> there<00:03:03.990> but<00:03:04.990> I'll<00:03:05.610> show

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
can't even tell us there but I'll show

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.370 
can't even tell us there but I'll show
you<00:03:06.640> how<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.880> put<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.510> just<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.810> second<00:03:08.200> to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
you how I put it on in just a second to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.490 
you how I put it on in just a second to
fix<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.459> problem<00:03:09.670> these<00:03:10.420> are<00:03:10.480> all<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.290> parts

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
fix this problem these are all the parts

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.170 
fix this problem these are all the parts
you<00:03:11.590> need<00:03:11.650> right<00:03:11.920> here

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
you need right here

you need right here
I<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:15.010> took<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:16.300> doesn't<00:03:16.630> take<00:03:16.810> much<00:03:16.990> just<00:03:17.290> a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
I just took it doesn't take much just a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.250 
I just took it doesn't take much just a
thin<00:03:17.830> maybe<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.250> half<00:03:18.550> millimeter<00:03:19.090> up<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
thin maybe a half millimeter up to a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.800 
thin maybe a half millimeter up to a
millimeter<00:03:21.570> piece<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.720> plastic<00:03:23.350> or<00:03:23.620> anything

[Music]

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.870 

just<00:03:37.030> apply<00:03:37.420> super<00:03:37.840> glue<00:03:38.400> all<00:03:39.400> around<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
just apply super glue all around the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.009 
just apply super glue all around the
surface<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.830> little<00:03:41.830> part<00:03:42.040> right<00:03:42.160> there

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
surface of that little part right there

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.460 
surface of that little part right there
and<00:03:44.970> don't<00:03:45.970> get<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.390> rail<00:03:46.570> where<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
and don't get it on the rail where the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.009 
and don't get it on the rail where the
laser<00:03:47.650> won't<00:03:47.860> be<00:03:47.950> able<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.160> slide<00:03:48.400> back<00:03:49.330> it

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
laser won't be able to slide back it

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.180 
laser won't be able to slide back it
would<00:03:50.140> catch<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.620> superglue

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
would catch on the superglue

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.420 
would catch on the superglue
but<00:03:51.970> apply<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.300> thin<00:03:52.750> coating<00:03:53.230> all<00:03:53.920> around<00:03:54.280> that

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
but apply a thin coating all around that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.160 
but apply a thin coating all around that
flat<00:03:54.670> surface<00:03:55.150> right<00:03:55.180> there<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:57.989> then<00:03:58.989> take

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
flat surface right there and then take

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:09.850 
flat surface right there and then take
the<00:03:59.350> shim<00:04:01.500> put<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.650> place<00:04:02.950> on

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.990 

I'm<00:04:10.370> not<00:04:10.610> flat<00:04:11.030> metal<00:04:11.510> surface<00:04:11.660> right<00:04:12.350> there

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
I'm not flat metal surface right there

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.460 
I'm not flat metal surface right there
and<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:17.450> will<00:04:17.540> keep<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.870> lasers<00:04:18.290> from

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
and that will keep the lasers from

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.470 
and that will keep the lasers from
sliding<00:04:18.739> all<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:18.980> way<00:04:19.100> back<00:04:19.370> out<00:04:19.580> out<00:04:20.120> from

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
sliding all the way back out out from

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.000 
sliding all the way back out out from
under<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.530> DVD<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.730> game<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:24.010> it's

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
under the DVD of the game and it's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.460 
under the DVD of the game and it's
worked<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:25.370> far<00:04:25.490> for<00:04:25.880> me<00:04:25.960> I've<00:04:26.960> been<00:04:27.080> using<00:04:27.290> it

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
worked so far for me I've been using it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.560 
worked so far for me I've been using it
for<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.680> while<00:04:27.770> I<00:04:28.070> keeps<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.790> going<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.240> guess<00:04:29.300> it

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
for a while I keeps on going I guess it

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.420 
for a while I keeps on going I guess it
basically<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.320> extends<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.980> life<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.370> your

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
basically just extends the life of your

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.720 
basically just extends the life of your
xbox<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.120> doesn't<00:04:32.390> really<00:04:32.510> fix<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.080> problem

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
xbox it doesn't really fix the problem

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.890 
xbox it doesn't really fix the problem
but<00:04:34.730> you'll<00:04:34.970> be<00:04:35.150> able<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.360> play<00:04:35.540> for<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.780> while

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
but you'll be able to play for a while

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.900 
but you'll be able to play for a while
and<00:04:36.410> it'll<00:04:36.830> keep<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.250> from<00:04:37.400> having<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.700> pay

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
and it'll keep you from having to pay

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.670 
and it'll keep you from having to pay
Microsoft<00:04:38.810> another<00:04:39.110> $120<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.900> once<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.590> get

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
Microsoft another $120 but once you get

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.760 
Microsoft another $120 but once you get
everything<00:04:42.890> back<00:04:43.130> together

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
everything back together

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.020 
everything back together
give<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.920> try<00:04:46.040> hopefully<00:04:46.550> it'll<00:04:46.640> work<00:04:46.730> for

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
give it a try hopefully it'll work for

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.860 
give it a try hopefully it'll work for
you<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.680> thanks<00:04:48.680> for<00:04:48.800> watching
