was<00:01:47.619> that<00:01:47.800> was<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:47.979> really<00:01:48.340> great<00:01:48.520> deal<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.540> I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
was that was a really great deal so I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.650 
was that was a really great deal so I
went<00:01:50.080> ahead<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.380> did<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.009> but<00:01:51.729> however<00:01:52.360> I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
went ahead and did that but however I

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.290 
went ahead and did that but however I
wasn't<00:01:53.110> aware<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:54.220> was<00:01:54.340> your<00:01:54.490> subtotal

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
wasn't aware that it was your subtotal

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.030 
wasn't aware that it was your subtotal
that<00:01:55.420> had<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.690> be<00:01:55.810> twenty<00:01:56.050> five<00:01:56.080> dollars<00:01:56.619> so<00:01:56.830> my

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
that had to be twenty five dollars so my

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.840 
that had to be twenty five dollars so my
total<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.700> my<00:01:58.450> total<00:01:59.170> in<00:01:59.290> total<00:01:59.500> my<00:02:00.369> total<00:02:00.729> in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850

total<00:02:01.150> was<00:02:01.330> $29<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:04.149> my<00:02:04.300> subtotal<00:02:04.869> was

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
total was $29 and really my subtotal was

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.020 
total was $29 and really my subtotal was
$23<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:05.920> didn't<00:02:06.190> even<00:02:06.280> end<00:02:06.490> up<00:02:06.580> getting<00:02:06.910> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
$23 so I didn't even end up getting the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.639 
$23 so I didn't even end up getting the
party<00:02:07.270> girl<00:02:07.420> palette<00:02:07.780> which<00:02:07.929> I<00:02:08.080> was<00:02:08.229> really

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
party girl palette which I was really

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.529

disappointed<00:02:08.830> about<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.940> emailed<00:02:10.210> them

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
disappointed about and I emailed them

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.990 
disappointed about and I emailed them
and<00:02:10.720> everything<00:02:11.290> but<00:02:12.250> they<00:02:12.340> let<00:02:12.520> me<00:02:12.640> know<00:02:12.670> that

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and everything but they let me know that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.700 
and everything but they let me know that
they<00:02:13.180> couldn't<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:13.960> anything<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.500> was

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
they couldn't do anything because it was

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.070 
they couldn't do anything because it was
just<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.280> subtotal<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:15.940> was<00:02:16.090> under<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
just the subtotal that was under the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
just the subtotal that was under the
limit<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.160> was<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> little<00:02:18.550> bit<00:02:18.670> disappointed

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
limit so I was a little bit disappointed

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.430 
limit so I was a little bit disappointed
bout<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.750> don't<00:02:19.900> know<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:19.990> really<00:02:20.080> want

I<00:03:52.049> wouldn't<00:03:53.049> it's<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> light<00:03:53.890> pink

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
I wouldn't it's not like a light pink

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280 
I wouldn't it's not like a light pink
it's<00:03:54.370> sort<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:54.880> borderline<00:03:55.450> fuchsia<00:03:55.930> but

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
it's sort of like borderline fuchsia but

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.170 
it's sort of like borderline fuchsia but
it<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.560> yeah<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> little<00:03:57.580> bit<00:03:57.760> fuchsia<00:03:58.030> I

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it is yeah it is a little bit fuchsia I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.550 
it is yeah it is a little bit fuchsia I
wouldn't<00:03:58.630> say<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:58.900> like<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.049> light<00:03:59.290> cool

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
wouldn't say it's like a light cool

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.650 
wouldn't say it's like a light cool
toned<00:03:59.830> pink<00:04:00.069> it's<00:04:00.640> cool<00:04:01.000> tones<00:04:01.239> but<00:04:01.540> it's

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
toned pink it's cool tones but it's

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.870 
toned pink it's cool tones but it's
definitely<00:04:01.810> more<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.620> fuchsia<00:04:02.980> darker

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
definitely more like a fuchsia darker

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.970 
definitely more like a fuchsia darker
pink<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.330> it's<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:05.080> beautiful<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:05.950> really

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
pink and it's just beautiful I really

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.339 
pink and it's just beautiful I really
wanted<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.700> use<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:07.030> for<00:04:07.060> my<00:04:07.360> waterline<00:04:07.780> now

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
wanted to use it for my waterline now

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.360 
wanted to use it for my waterline now
the<00:04:08.410> reason<00:04:08.739> why<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:08.890> thought<00:04:09.069> this<00:04:09.190> would<00:04:09.310> be

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
the reason why I thought this would be

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.920 
the reason why I thought this would be
perfect<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:09.910> because<00:04:10.180> they<00:04:10.299> are<00:04:10.420> waterproof

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
perfect is because they are waterproof

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.570 
perfect is because they are waterproof
so<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.709> thought<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:12.010> they<00:04:12.099> would<00:04:12.250> work<00:04:12.370> great

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
so I thought that they would work great

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.030 
so I thought that they would work great
for<00:04:12.940> your<00:04:13.299> waterline<00:04:13.690> or<00:04:13.870> even<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.470> lining

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
for your waterline or even just lining

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.529 
for your waterline or even just lining
right<00:04:15.190> on<00:04:15.310> top<00:04:15.519> of<00:04:15.730> your<00:04:15.880> liner<00:04:16.060> sort<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.359> doing

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
right on top of your liner sort of doing

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.330 
right on top of your liner sort of doing
like<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> double<00:04:17.019> liner<00:04:17.169> look<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.039> I<00:04:18.070> really

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
like a double liner look so I really

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.150 
like a double liner look so I really
wanted<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:20.440> next<00:04:20.709> thing<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.010> did

wanted to get that the next thing I did

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.520 
wanted to get that the next thing I did

lighter<00:04:32.350> it's<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.070> little<00:04:33.310> bit<00:04:33.400> darker<00:04:33.669> than<00:04:33.820> I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
lighter it's a little bit darker than I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.820 
lighter it's a little bit darker than I
had<00:04:34.180> anticipated

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
had anticipated

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.190 
had anticipated
but<00:04:36.270> yeah<00:04:37.270> it's<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.539> little<00:04:37.630> bit<00:04:37.810> lighter<00:04:37.990> I

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
but yeah it's a little bit lighter I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.250 
but yeah it's a little bit lighter I
might<00:04:38.710> use<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.340> sort<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.360> think<00:04:40.389> I<00:04:40.840> think

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
might use it sort of I think I think

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.779 
might use it sort of I think I think

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
I'll probably use it just to put

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.790 
I'll probably use it just to put
underneath<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.930> lash<00:04:44.169> line<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.560> sort<00:04:44.740> of

is a small lip liner brush now the

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.280 
is a small lip liner brush now the
reason<00:05:37.270> why<00:05:37.360> I<00:05:37.390> got<00:05:37.570> this<00:05:37.780> one<00:05:37.930> is<00:05:38.020> because<00:05:38.260> a

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
reason why I got this one is because a

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.590 
reason why I got this one is because a
lot<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.590> my<00:05:38.770> lipsticks<00:05:39.400> they<00:05:39.850> are<00:05:40.030> in<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.360> tube

lot of my lipsticks they are in the tube

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.110 
lot of my lipsticks they are in the tube

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
to put it on and I kind of really wanted

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.740 
to put it on and I kind of really wanted
a<00:05:53.980> brush<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:54.580> I<00:05:54.880> just<00:05:55.240> went<00:05:55.390> ahead<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.660> got

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
a brush so I just went ahead and got

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.180 
a brush so I just went ahead and got
this<00:05:55.900> one<00:05:56.080> because<00:05:56.230> it's<00:05:56.380> cheap<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.860> I<00:05:57.010> mean

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
this one because it's cheap and I mean

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.920 
this one because it's cheap and I mean
it's<00:05:57.520> not<00:05:58.060> like<00:05:58.240> I'll<00:05:58.360> be<00:05:58.480> using<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:58.900> very

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
it's not like I'll be using it very

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.020 
it's not like I'll be using it very
often<00:05:59.380> it<00:05:59.500> comes<00:05:59.620> with<00:05:59.800> like<00:05:59.890> a<00:05:59.980> little<00:06:00.250> lid

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
often it comes with like a little lid

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.210 
often it comes with like a little lid
but<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:01.870> can<00:06:02.020> also<00:06:02.260> sort<00:06:02.620> of<00:06:02.800> just<00:06:02.950> put<00:06:03.130> it

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
but you can also sort of just put it

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.800 
but you can also sort of just put it
like<00:06:03.340> this<00:06:03.550> like<00:06:03.760> I<00:06:03.910> just<00:06:03.970> did<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.510> make<00:06:04.780> it

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
like this like I just did and make it

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.750 
like this like I just did and make it
into<00:06:05.170> an<00:06:05.290> actual<00:06:05.800> brush<00:06:06.070> so<00:06:06.310> it<00:06:06.400> doesn't<00:06:06.670> look

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
into an actual brush so it doesn't look

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.070 
into an actual brush so it doesn't look
like<00:06:06.910> you're<00:06:07.030> putting<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.420> on<00:06:07.510> top<00:06:07.690> of<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:07.960> or

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
like you're putting it on top of it or

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.540 
like you're putting it on top of it or
something<00:06:08.230> it<00:06:08.470> looks<00:06:08.500> like<00:06:08.800> an<00:06:08.920> actual<00:06:09.340> brush

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
something it looks like an actual brush

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.310 
something it looks like an actual brush
when<00:06:09.760> you<00:06:09.850> make<00:06:10.030> it<00:06:10.180> like<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.480> so<00:06:11.080> I<00:06:11.110> thought

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
when you make it like that so I thought

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.020 
when you make it like that so I thought
that<00:06:11.590> was<00:06:11.770> really<00:06:11.950> cool<00:06:12.250> almost<00:06:12.640> likely<00:06:12.880> to

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
that was really cool almost likely to

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.390 
that was really cool almost likely to
leaving<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.390> like<00:06:13.660> this<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.290> the<00:06:14.920> last<00:06:15.160> thing

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
leaving it like this and the last thing

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.580 
leaving it like this and the last thing
that<00:06:15.430> I<00:06:15.580> got<00:06:15.880> is<00:06:16.090> a<00:06:16.390> lipstick<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:17.110> had<00:06:17.350> you<00:06:17.500> know
