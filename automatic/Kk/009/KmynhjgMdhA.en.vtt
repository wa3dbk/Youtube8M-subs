00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.930
 very good in what is comedy and criticism 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.059

 1999 falls by chance in a capsule 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.619
 cryogenic and wake up a thousand years later 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.619
 this series is my favorite and I think 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.290
 which of you equal number 3 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.050
 malcom the middle one the series consists of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.670
 The love for survival of a teenager 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.810
 gifted called malcolm in the middle of 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.600
 a middle class family 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.270
 American the theme of the episodes 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.190
 varies a lot from simple exams in the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 fierce school battles between 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.910
 members of the family to episodes in 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 those who badly as it is debated between the 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.410
 childhood and adolescence which 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.300
 confuses even more each situation 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.330
 teaches to survive and valuable lessons 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.280
 who always learns the hard way one of 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.310
 the best in my opinion 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560
 2 the walking dead the plot starts 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.250
 when a policeman called rick is injured 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 by a bullet 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.150
 days later he wakes up from a coma and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.959
 discover that the world is made one 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.420
 great shit 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.640
 rick next to two survivors a boy 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.140
 and his father take refuge in a house until 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.120
 that ricky decides to go look for his 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.160
 family to find it together with more 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 survivors will do everything possible 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 to live in a world to appear is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.800
 almost dead number one if I know that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.080
 many will already know what it is if they are the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.180
 simpson the best and one of the most 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.970
 old not from focs but from television 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.190
 I do not need to tell you about what 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.019
 treats the series because the one that has not 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.480
 seen is because he does not have a television 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.330
 he does not live in a cave xd but he 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.819
 I will tell xdddd good this animated series 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.480
 is created by whom we already mentioned ma 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.250
 groening 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.920
 this family that lives in the city of 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.230
 springfield in the usa the series is 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.900
 formed five main characters 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 homero marge bart lisa and maggie simpson 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.519
 among more secondary characters good 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.160

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.340
 my top 5 of the best series of the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.080
