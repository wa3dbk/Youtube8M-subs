00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
we came out here and in the second half

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.700 
we came out here and in the second half
we<00:06:20.760> slow<00:06:21.030> down<00:06:21.270> I<00:06:21.540> realized<00:06:22.230> that<00:06:22.350> watching

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
we slow down I realized that watching

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.640 
we slow down I realized that watching
the<00:06:22.800> video<00:06:23.210> making<00:06:24.210> these<00:06:24.480> videos<00:06:24.540> gives<00:06:25.410> me<00:06:25.620> a

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
the video making these videos gives me a

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.100 
the video making these videos gives me a
slightly<00:06:26.070> I<00:06:26.940> don't<00:06:27.570> want<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.780> say<00:06:27.870> it's<00:06:28.020> an

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
slightly I don't want to say it's an

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.690 
slightly I don't want to say it's an
unfair<00:06:28.440> advantage<00:06:28.620> because<00:06:29.070> i'm<00:06:29.280> still<00:06:29.490> doing

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
unfair advantage because i'm still doing

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.310 
unfair advantage because i'm still doing
some<00:06:29.940> work<00:06:30.120> here<00:06:30.300> but<00:06:30.510> I<00:06:30.750> get<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:30.960> chance<00:06:31.200> to

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
some work here but I get a chance to

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.780 
some work here but I get a chance to
kind<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.530> study<00:06:31.740> film<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:32.250> see<00:06:32.340> what<00:06:32.490> we<00:06:32.610> did

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
kind of study film and see what we did

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.820 
kind of study film and see what we did
wrong<00:06:32.820> and<00:06:33.360> we<00:06:33.810> slowed<00:06:34.050> down<00:06:34.260> in<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:34.560> second

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
wrong and we slowed down in the second

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.770 
wrong and we slowed down in the second
half<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.220> I<00:06:35.670> think<00:06:35.730> that<00:06:35.970> kind<00:06:36.330> of<00:06:36.390> allowed

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
half and I think that kind of allowed

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.200 
half and I think that kind of allowed
them<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.080> catch<00:06:37.440> up<00:06:37.620> some<00:06:37.770> ground<00:06:37.950> so<00:06:38.340> they<00:06:38.970> got

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
them to catch up some ground so they got

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.090 
them to catch up some ground so they got
