make<00:00:32.489> dog<00:00:32.820> show<00:00:33.059> mod<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
make dog show mod as you can see it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.040 
make dog show mod as you can see it
doesn't<00:00:35.070> take<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.460> many<00:00:35.880> resources<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.809> make

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
doesn't take that many resources to make

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.860 
doesn't take that many resources to make
the<00:00:37.200> hook<00:00:37.350> shot<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.460> never<00:00:38.870> deteriorates

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the hook shot and it never deteriorates

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.650 
the hook shot and it never deteriorates
so<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.710> use<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> forever<00:00:41.660> literally

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
so you can use it forever literally

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.069 
so you can use it forever literally
forever<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:44.219> unless<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.820> updates<00:00:45.149> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
forever or unless it updates but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.319 
forever or unless it updates but
basically<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.890> put<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> iron<00:00:47.430> ingot<00:00:47.820> into

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
