00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
world trigger doesn't have many

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.340 
world trigger doesn't have many
characters<00:02:52.300> with<00:02:52.510> side<00:02:52.840> effects<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.200> mean

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
characters with side effects I mean

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.690 
characters with side effects I mean
there's<00:02:53.500> some<00:02:53.740> side<00:02:53.980> effects<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.520> seen

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
there's some side effects we have seen

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.640 
there's some side effects we have seen
throughout<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.210> series<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.260> don't<00:02:56.410> see

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
throughout the series but you don't see

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.500 
throughout the series but you don't see
a<00:02:56.830> lot<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.190> characters<00:02:57.640> with<00:02:58.000> side<00:02:58.210> effects

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
a lot of characters with side effects

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.090 
a lot of characters with side effects
and<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> see<00:02:59.020> this<00:02:59.230> type<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.440> side<00:02:59.710> effect<00:02:59.980> it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
and to see this type of side effect it's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.500 
and to see this type of side effect it's
very<00:03:00.280> unique<00:03:00.460> it's<00:03:00.790> very<00:03:00.850> different<00:03:01.240> from

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
very unique it's very different from

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.770 
very unique it's very different from
what<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.980> expected<00:03:02.980> from<00:03:03.270> side<00:03:04.270> effects<00:03:04.600> in

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
what I expected from side effects in

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.330 
what I expected from side effects in
general<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:05.860> type<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.100> side

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
general and so to see that type of side

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.160 
general and so to see that type of side
effect<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.730> goes<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.000> show<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.270> it's<00:03:07.930> very

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
effect it goes to show you it's very

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.810 
effect it goes to show you it's very
useful<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:08.740> not<00:03:08.860> useful<00:03:09.070> at<00:03:09.250> first<00:03:09.520> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820
