00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello and welcome to sap in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.379
 this video we want the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 gaming performance of the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 a little bit more accurate test 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 So let's see how things turn out in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 play the tempera 2 dead trigger and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 four modern combat so suggests how 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 always the usual I have the device 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.439
 just be rebooted so 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 No running apps is the ram 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.160
 emptied and I will as soon as I am with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 finished this game again 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.239
 close before I start a new one like that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
 that we really paul the hardware hardware 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 to get to see this smartphones 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.579
 the games are not all 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.200
 preinstalled her but can watch the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.180
 warrior and temperature in one 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.590
 free ad-supported version in the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.079
 download place tor 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.449
 there is also much modern combat the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.890
 but it costs a little bit that was 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.070
 it now also I wish you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.920
 Have fun watching! Let's go 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.100
 So, as always, temple ranks first 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 Two a game with their low 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 There are also some 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.470
 Devices gives the lady problems and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.780
 It is still a very popular one 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.540
 play and just with a device like that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 galaxy s for mini that too he 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.240
 I speak to beginners 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.460
 even if it is currently too 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 expensive is always very interesting 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 we see visual quality here 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.950
 would of course I found 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.340
 say we start what immediately stands out 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 especially with this player there very much 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.000
 strong colors has since makes the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.400
 amoled-display of course absolutely awesome 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.119
 many now like that as oversubscribed 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.950
 feel 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.990
 I can only tell you the colors are 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.899
 Absolutely if I can already see that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 really stunning and great I think 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.950
 you also see her very well 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.920
 performance is really neat it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 There are no problems 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.280
 as I said now, probably 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.680
 most say yes with temporal 2 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.100
 few have smartphones problems 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.860
 I currently also that 11 of 52 lg 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.409
 electronics as clearly that costs significantly 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.119
 less but that has for example 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.560
 noticeable problems with tempera 2 so 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.799
 Also this smartphone, there is always 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.300
 still 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.340
 that's a jelly bean, too 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.400
 smartphone and that still happens 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.530
 even if it is natural 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.150
 I can only say again clearly 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.349
 cheaper but otherwise you see 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.480
 Here I think very well 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.519
 The galaxy s four mini has none 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.319
 problems especially if you have it now 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.120
 so has the good side 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.989
 view stability again 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 so much to temper 2 and on 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.790
 So it goes with the carrier of the sentence 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.220
 already significantly higher requirements 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.049
 yes a shooter look at us all the time 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.659
 that was already visible here 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.129
 the ingenious black value and here too 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.530
 Of course, the amoled-display makes itself 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.299
 you know, we know each other 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.930
 here no more bentheim matrix but 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.030
 a rgb matrix wm 256 pixels per inch 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 and you can see it clearly 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.579
 displays that solve much higher 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.780
 he will soon be the htc one mini too 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.849
 be presented and that will 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.889
 probably the same 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.170
 screen diagonal so 4.3 inches a hd 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.239
 but still have the display 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.370
 pretty neat about this 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.720
 You can see the display of the galaxy s four mini 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.340
 Do not complain at all 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.170
 where I think that one at the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.459
 current price also such a display 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.319
 can expect 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.810
 otherwise you will also see the here 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.419
 performance is absolutely great we go 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.639
 also a little closer 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:26.889
 and that really makes me a lot of fun 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.019
 find that just at a play 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.849
 the amoled displays are super easy 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.769
 because the colors very often also from the 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.690
 play or by the developers 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.459
 If desired, they are chosen overdrawn and 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.129
 that just looks absolutely great 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.500
 What can I say with the tempera 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.359
 two taps the trigger i mean 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.220
 Of course, there is also there 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.989
 no problems as we look next 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.079
 us then modern combat 4 on 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.389
 So continue with modern combat 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.280
 Four definitely the game with the 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.989
 There were highest requirements in the year 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.729
 now also an update in the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.680
 Last days for sure even the 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.870
 Name designation looks slightly changed 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.340
 you now also at the background 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.040
 Here we have another one now 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.690
 background that merz down update is 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.159
 me here now when it comes to four mini 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.239
 first noticed 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.239
 Of course we also want that 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.979
 now it will be four 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.479
 mini clearly claiming as well 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.449
 it actually does not cause any problems 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.750
 should have the snapdragon 400 is one 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.550
 very very potent cpu as well we have 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.530
 here yes 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.240
 just in quotes a kitsch the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.099
 So resolution not so much to 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.220
 render as well as here again 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.680
 the text is nice and sharp despite only 256 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.270
 pixel per inch loading times are not 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.669
 especially long i think i have you right now 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.949
 Seen quite well and the contrast values 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.610
 We're absolutely stunning again 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:49.470
 start right now here and 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.389
 Run forward here so you see 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.699
 at least my humble 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.199
 opinion, the graphic is really 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.690
 You can actually get along pretty well 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.580
 Do not complain, we'll go right here 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.020
 down 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:08.520
 I always have problems with the 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:10.919
 comparatively small displays has 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.229
 neither does it survive because of me 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.629
 just used slightly larger displays 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.550
 So I apologize for that 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.099
 go here but discovery otherwise 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.229
 is the performance I think you can 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.750
 quite good also see the well 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.550
 loudspeaker is relatively neat hear 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.580
 I here right now heard that 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.380
 maybe not so good but there too 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.319
 You can not really complain 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.969
 I waited for you we throw 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.919
 now again a grenade after 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.539
 the front already has tradition 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.969
 you see the nice ones up here, too 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.400
 There are graphics effects there 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.469
 no problems and no such 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.500
 troublemaker 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.240
 well that was it so modern now 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.229
 combat four I think you have here too 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.930
 seen quite well 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.599
 it all goes very smoothly 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.639
 fun looks good i hope that came 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.080
 About the camera synonymous well over what 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.729
 can conclusively say 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.490
 similar to the samsung galaxy 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.190
 mega 6.3 yes that synonymous with the snapdragon 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.080
 Has 400 strikes itself the 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.360
 galaxy is mini for gaming 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.979
 really great especially clear 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.779
 better than the predecessor if you are 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.599
 because even on the main gaming video recalls 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:20.370
 the performance really terrible 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.139
 at least in the beginning that has become 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.849
 but now that's improved 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.919
 thank god from the beginning 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.659
 no longer the case the only thing one 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.699
 of course, the limited is limited 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:32.399
 display diagonal straight when larger 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.930
 it is used but i mean the people 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.320
 which is that there are four mini buy the 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.020
 want a compact device and that 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.310
 had that hit people that well 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.620
 it was already from this again 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.270
 short gaming test of the Samsung Galaxy S 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.460
 four mini I hope, of course, as always 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.590
 the video did you please thank me 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.340
 to watch and say ' see you' 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.340
 next time
