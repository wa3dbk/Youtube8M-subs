00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 good 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.160
 we had 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.559
 hello once again his dirty lion 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.210
 welcome to my point is today 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.650
 I will give you my point of view about 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.500
 of a topic for which I have been asked 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.660
 enough which I consider very logical already 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.170
 that as mentioned before our 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.280
 audience is of young people from 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.890
 guys who are probably studying 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.410
 high school or already his career 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.740
 professional and they have doubts and have 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.890
 totally normal fears about 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.570
 what decision to take and concern 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.790
 about what happens when you leave the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.920
 college career and you're going to 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.420
 face the labor field first that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.070
 I'm telling you, all those fears 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.050
 and all those worries that have 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.310
 they are totally normal is something that 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.170
 all of us who study a career 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.570
 university we face in some 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.760
 moment but do not worry is not the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.410
 end of the world and good today I 'm going to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.870
 talk a little about all this 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.700
 first of all how to make the decision 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.070
 if you are in high school or in the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.989
 prepare surely your relatives or 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.689
 friends already ask you the question of what 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.440
 you're going to study and it's certainly not a 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.040
 simple decision since what you decide 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 it will surely be something that 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.970
 dedicate the rest of your life lived 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.710
 surely because there are isolated cases in 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.930
 those that although a race ends 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.939
 university because it is not exercised but 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.399
 well let's hope that is not the case 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.990
 for you or what is 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.030
 go much better than if you will be dedicated to 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.680
 a career but I do not want to deviate from the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.650
 topic and I think I'm doing it that way 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.090
 that we go to the point 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.119
 throughout this period in which 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.000
 you will have to make that decision it will be that 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.369
 the main thing is that you like it and in that 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.530
 They are absolutely right if you are going to dedicate 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.049
 that's what your whole life has to like 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.659
 we already have enough professionals 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.479
 who do things unwillingly or who 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.149
 They have no ethics or they do not have the talent 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.070
 enough to develop then what 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.950
 they have to do so really 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.750
 They have to like you but there is something very 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.730
 important 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.980
 and it works like a 5150 you have to like it 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.460
 and it has to be profitable not always 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.830
 we can let ourselves be carried away by what 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.740
 we find it exciting or because of what 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.560
 we see that the others were good 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.490
 you do not have to like it but you have to 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.450
 be aware that of that you will live 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.030
 and unfortunately there are professions in 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 those that do not go so well but 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.410
 here I will pause or a 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.500
 very important comment I am 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.990
 graphic designer and my career has a 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.790
 a lot of taboos he one of them 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.140
 and the heaviest is that people think 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.680
 that the graphic designer does not have a 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.710
 labor field or earning very little ok 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.700
 this first thing that nothing is a bad 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.250
 generalization 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.260
 I am a graphic designer and since 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.420
 I was studying I had work on 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.280
 work is for those who seek it for 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.740
 person who is constant and for the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.510
 person who has the talent or the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.400
 availability to do things what 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.500
 best possible if you're going to be a 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.630
 mediocre professional a professional 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.790
 to do things to do them 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.320
 you will hardly have a job or if 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.660
 you're waiting for that job to 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.000
 the work will not arrive 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.890
 have to go out and look and if you 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.990
 they closed one two three ten doors 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.970
 you have to keep touching doors you have 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.880
 what to generate in this case in my case 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.390
 you have to generate design and take it 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.940
 to see it you have to make yourself see 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.819
 if you do, I assure you that you will have 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.290
 work and work well paid I am a 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.390
 designer and I can tell you about that 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.480
 way it has not gone wrong I've never been 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.690
 bad I can not complain and that's what I 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.379
 I love and good there are other activities that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.220
 can make the designer is 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.840
 multidisciplinary but let's go out 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 of design in any career in 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.540
 any discipline you have to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.280
 worry about the labor field so 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.430
 that you can win if you can live from that 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.849
 if you have the talent or the disposition of 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.860
 generate that talent but the best will be 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.629
 you consider other possibilities you 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.080
 I assure you there is something you can do 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.810
 very well 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.010
 and I repeat you have to like me I know 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.200
 that there are many families in which 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.209
 parents force the children to study 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.190
 certain career that's a very bad thing 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.890
 and that's when we need to get the momentum 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.690
 and the rebellion of youth you can not 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.300
 study what they impose you have to 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.790
 study what you decide once 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.960
 you have thought well and good if you already 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.740
 you are studying your career visits 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.760
 worried about that labor field 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.030
 worry only what is necessary 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.820
 really looking for the job and you're going to 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.920
 find and to make the decision then 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.440
 just what you like but 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.300
 think about it very well, analyze people who 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.849
 already in that labor field 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.749
 ask question is always going to be 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.969
 the best solution to know who we are 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.439
 let's face then it's lion 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.659
 I hope this short video has 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.969
 helped end of accounts does not require 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:06.059
 greater science is in you the meaning 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.669
 common and you can relax do not let the 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:10.319
 pressure affects you too just a little 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.539
 because working the conversion is good 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.139
 but do not let it affect you too much and 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.319
 decide for yourself because it will be your 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.719
 future will be your life and good this 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.429
 subject was given by some people 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:26.039

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:28.949
