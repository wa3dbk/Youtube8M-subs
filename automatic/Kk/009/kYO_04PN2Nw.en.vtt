like<00:01:56.890> he<00:01:57.460> just<00:01:57.640> makes<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.970> easy<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.300> score

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
like he just makes it easy to score

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.430 
like he just makes it easy to score
somehow<00:01:59.650> and<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.480> he's<00:02:01.480> got<00:02:01.660> good<00:02:01.840> hand-eye<00:02:02.260> as

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
somehow and I he's got good hand-eye as

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.920 
somehow and I he's got good hand-eye as
well<00:02:02.710> as<00:02:03.370> we<00:02:03.520> see<00:02:03.700> here<00:02:03.730> I<00:02:04.300> actually<00:02:04.660> know

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
well as we see here I actually know

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.450 
well as we see here I actually know
that's<00:02:05.230> just<00:02:05.290> another<00:02:05.620> example<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:06.190> him<00:02:06.310> just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
that's just another example of him just

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.950 
that's just another example of him just
picking<00:02:06.730> up<00:02:06.820> loose<00:02:07.030> pucks<00:02:07.270> in<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.480> slot<00:02:07.720> and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
picking up loose pucks in the slot and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.450 
picking up loose pucks in the slot and
it's<00:02:08.170> nice

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
it's nice

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.000 
it's nice
and<00:02:09.450> another<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.320> this<00:02:10.620> is<00:02:10.680> a<00:02:10.800> good

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
and another I think this is a good

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.250 
and another I think this is a good
example<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.580> his<00:02:11.730> hand<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.060> he<00:02:12.240> bats<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.870> down<00:02:13.050> as

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
example of his hand I he bats it down as

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.430 
example of his hand I he bats it down as
just<00:02:13.410> fires<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> net<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.140> a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
just fires it into the net just the a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.920 
just fires it into the net just the a
great<00:02:17.100> offensive<00:02:17.460> sniper<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.150> he's<00:02:18.210> also<00:02:18.600> got

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
great offensive sniper and he's also got

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.020 
great offensive sniper and he's also got
a<00:02:19.110> really<00:02:19.530> good<00:02:19.680> poke<00:02:20.010> check<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.730> always

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
a really good poke check I'm always

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.550 
a really good poke check I'm always
poking<00:02:21.390> away<00:02:21.600> from<00:02:21.870> players<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> getting

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
poking away from players and getting

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920 
poking away from players and getting
that<00:02:22.650> speed<00:02:23.150> getting<00:02:24.150> those<00:02:24.270> odd<00:02:24.450> man<00:02:24.660> rushes

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
that speed getting those odd man rushes

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.100 
that speed getting those odd man rushes
from<00:02:25.320> his<00:02:25.770> uh<00:02:25.800> his<00:02:26.510> pressure<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> point

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
from his uh his pressure on the point

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.870 
from his uh his pressure on the point
and<00:02:28.320> even<00:02:28.830> pressure<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> offensive<00:02:29.730> zone

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and even pressure on the offensive zone

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.940 
and even pressure on the offensive zone
for<00:02:30.240> checking<00:02:30.660> drawing<00:02:31.200> penalties<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.770> stuff

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
for checking drawing penalties and stuff

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.130 
for checking drawing penalties and stuff
like<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.540> that's<00:02:33.720> definitely<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
like that I think that's definitely a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.460 
like that I think that's definitely a
pro<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.490> Havlat<00:02:36.270> his<00:02:36.480> PO<00:02:36.690> checking<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.260> not

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
pro for Havlat his PO checking it's not

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.810 
pro for Havlat his PO checking it's not
really<00:02:37.800> rated<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.190> high<00:02:38.250> i<00:02:38.400> think<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.760> at

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
really rated that high i think it's at

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.290 
really rated that high i think it's at
84<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.360> 83<00:02:39.900> but<00:02:40.710> as<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.550> here<00:02:41.820> like<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
84 and 83 but as you can see here like a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.270 
84 and 83 but as you can see here like a
majority<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.260> my<00:02:43.410> chances<00:02:43.800> actually<00:02:44.100> come

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
majority of my chances actually come

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.180 
majority of my chances actually come
from<00:02:44.310> his<00:02:44.580> poke<00:02:44.850> checks<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.300> his<00:02:45.390> turnovers

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
from his poke checks and his turnovers

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.210 
from his poke checks and his turnovers
and<00:02:47.210> another<00:02:48.210> example<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.800> happens

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and another example here like it happens

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.210 
and another example here like it happens
a<00:02:50.310> lot<00:02:50.460> for<00:02:50.730> me<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.410> don't<00:02:52.410> know<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:52.770> just<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
a lot for me I don't know if it's just a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.490 
a lot for me I don't know if it's just a
good<00:02:53.460> time<00:02:53.700> with<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> poke<00:02:54.150> checks<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.690> he's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
good time with the poke checks but he's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.770 
good time with the poke checks but he's
also<00:02:55.710> got<00:02:56.010> good<00:02:56.700> passing<00:02:57.150> as<00:02:57.240> well<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.600> see

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
also got good passing as well as you see

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.270 
also got good passing as well as you see
here<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.320> another<00:02:58.530> example<00:02:58.710> of<00:02:58.950> his<00:02:59.070> poke

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
here and another example of his poke

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.470 
here and another example of his poke
check<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.640> poking<00:02:59.880> it<00:02:59.970> through<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.210> goalies

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
check and poking it through the goalies

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.560 
check and poking it through the goalies
legs<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:00.960> kyra<00:03:01.230> contrived<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> put<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:01.980> home

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
legs for kyra contrived to put at home

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.240 
legs for kyra contrived to put at home
and<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:04.050> hardly<00:03:04.320> ever<00:03:04.380> get<00:03:04.650> penalties<00:03:04.890> with<00:03:05.130> him

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
and I hardly ever get penalties with him

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.000 
and I hardly ever get penalties with him
too<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> guess<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.150> good<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:07.020> good

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
too so I guess that's a good a good

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.740 
too so I guess that's a good a good
thing<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.460> well<00:03:08.490> being<00:03:09.060> able<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.360> use<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.570> Pope

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
thing as well being able to use the Pope

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.910 
thing as well being able to use the Pope
check<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.350> worry<00:03:10.650> about<00:03:10.710> getting

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
check and not worry about getting

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.060 
check and not worry about getting
penalties<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.400> much<00:03:12.410> good<00:03:13.410> Deacon<00:03:13.800> as<00:03:13.920> well

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
penalties that much good Deacon as well

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.820 
penalties that much good Deacon as well
look<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:14.280> those<00:03:14.430> hands<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:15.500> toe<00:03:16.500> dragging

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
look at those hands going toe dragging

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.860 
look at those hands going toe dragging
around<00:03:16.920> Dion<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.400> an<00:03:17.520> offer<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.720> good

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
around Dion for an offer a really good

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.420 
around Dion for an offer a really good
defenseman<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.620> look<00:03:19.740> at<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.890> speed<00:03:20.130> here

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
defenseman and look at the speed here

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.670 
defenseman and look at the speed here
able<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.210> get<00:03:21.300> around<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.660> guy<00:03:21.840> easily<00:03:22.140> good

able to get around that guy easily good

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.460 
able to get around that guy easily good
forehand<00:03:23.400> backhand<00:03:24.020> another<00:03:25.020> example<00:03:25.170> is

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
forehand backhand another example is

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.230 
forehand backhand another example is
good<00:03:25.680> hands<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.400> always<00:03:26.850> getting<00:03:27.180> in

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
good hands here and always getting in

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.060 
good hands here and always getting in
first<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> forecheck<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.740> don't<00:03:28.890> get<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
first on the forecheck you don't get to

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.710 
first on the forecheck you don't get to
those<00:03:29.250> loose<00:03:29.460> parts<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.000> said<00:03:30.210> his<00:03:30.390> speed<00:03:30.690> is

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
those loose parts as I said his speed is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.380 
those loose parts as I said his speed is
what<00:03:31.080> separates<00:03:31.440> him<00:03:31.650> from<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.190> other

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
what separates him from all the other

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.850 
what separates him from all the other
snipers<00:03:33.390> out<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.810> maybe<00:03:34.080> Garrett<00:03:34.380> Marian

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
snipers out there maybe Garrett Marian

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.990 
snipers out there maybe Garrett Marian
Gaborik<00:03:35.070> might<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.580> little<00:03:35.730> bit<00:03:35.880> better

to have that a little bit I mean a
little<00:04:05.790> bit<00:04:05.940> less<00:04:06.270> pucks<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.530> I'm<00:04:07.760> Mason

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
little bit less pucks but I'm Mason

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.580 
little bit less pucks but I'm Mason
Raymond<00:04:09.120> he's<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.330> right<00:04:09.750> he's<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.110> left<00:04:10.410> winger

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
Raymond he's a right he's a left winger

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.010 
Raymond he's a right he's a left winger
actually<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:11.250> he's<00:04:11.430> left-handed<00:04:12.300> just<00:04:12.900> like

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
actually but he's left-handed just like

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.980 
actually but he's left-handed just like
Havili<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.650> he's<00:04:13.800> got<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.850> same<00:04:15.150> speed<00:04:15.660> well

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
I think he's look oh yeah he's got the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.729 
I think he's look oh yeah he's got the
same<00:04:17.820> speed<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.510> they're<00:04:19.080> both<00:04:19.260> speedy

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739
