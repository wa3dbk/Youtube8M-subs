00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.319
 we come to another parent plant of Computerbild de and also at the 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:24.390
 ski-wm today shows you how no Pierre Krause after the 70 x 2 of Reishi 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.990
 a water cooler hug my but gives Stefan Rinck extreme of 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.670
 Bangladesh Sheikh by Georg Kerath 70x2 Kruger by Aqua Computer is 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.350
 most likely cheapest percent around 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.070
 in this segment 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.190
 Laurent too 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 Buttons that children have come up with and that's it too 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 Löw is supposed to open the door on this topic 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 Custom placed on tripod and Klose 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.970
 Here the graphics cards discovers graphics card coolers 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.940
 a little bit of paper 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340
 it fit 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
 screwdriver 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.020
 all that we deliver with the cooler 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 works in the light 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 We always start with those disposal of the old heat sink 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.630
 the screws of the mountains are dismantled 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 given the 8 screws of the two US 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 two screws in the weekend 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.230
 look at the two screws 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
 from the FARC is known 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 then succeed again lose weight 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 very carefully again 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 the cable 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 persuade the remaining old inheritance right on the back 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 Now make the old lady at Becquerel fit 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.479
 uko 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:18.429
 in the next step 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.019
 Trucker thermal grease 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.209
 the teams out 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.209
 comes the work of the foundation 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.259
 for the ball 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.259
 but also stones 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.369
 in Gröbenzell 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.799
 the phase i want a 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.519
 the voltage transformers a 2 3 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.519
 but just was still a voltage transformer 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.060
 Roadway 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.999
 the VTs suspect betrayal 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.169
 I was crazy 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.370
 For all these parts, here are the pieces to right Uli Giesel on the 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:54.329
 Card on 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.329
 Vin 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.739
 Dr 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 we offer 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 such copper protect now 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.019
 hang up the cool Cabinda 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.889
 here again as a landmark 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:24.589
 Hartmann was 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.589
 careful on the 2 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.789
 Of course, you also have to give evidence 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.659
 brought up beside 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.469
 but there the KSC 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.469
 has to move 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 Next went through the show for maintenance 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.659
 and who first 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.209
 the 8 stream burned around this 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.209
 unscrew the ENSI m3 at 6 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.759
 Been terminated in July 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.389
 The former wanted very much like at night 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.419
 the special feature of this new cooler is 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.419
 the old Beck world 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.819
 as Pacult also grows 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.779
 will also bury a little forest 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.779
 Secco screws are enclosed 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.719
 suffer from it 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:58.900
 these Bayern stop 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.349
 Bechert unused there will also be on the front 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.210
 not at all with the cooler 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.210
 we are already done with that 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.210
 and you can 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.819
 your water cooling 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.819
 go into operation 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.210
 so the Wars he was with another viewer Löw a graphics card cooler 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.309
 for the 4870x2 the first on YouTube 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:39.909
 by Claus Ulrich Brockmann in Chile and Aqua Computer Berlin 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.050
 see you again next game 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.849
 Rama if he wanted to hear the music around 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.229
 a professional distance look who did 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.639
 the Bernese will work until soon
