YouTube and people compliment me on here

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.430 
YouTube and people compliment me on here
after<00:05:09.889> we're<00:05:10.040> talking<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.729> all<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:12.200> feedback

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
after we're talking and all the feedback

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.200 
after we're talking and all the feedback
is<00:05:12.770> going<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.130> be<00:05:13.250> positive<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.880> should<00:05:14.090> just

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
is going to be positive so I should just

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.750 
is going to be positive so I should just
take<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.570> right<00:05:14.720> okay<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.320> no<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.770> disagree<00:05:16.370> with

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
take it right okay so no I disagree with

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.400 
take it right okay so no I disagree with
that<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:17.150> think<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.510> logic<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.110> really

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
that and I think that logic is really

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.440 
that and I think that logic is really
irrational<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.460> be<00:05:19.580> quite<00:05:19.729> frank<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:20.240> think

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
irrational and to be quite frank I think

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.860 
irrational and to be quite frank I think
it's<00:05:20.570> stupid<00:05:20.870> because<00:05:21.620> if<00:05:22.610> you<00:05:23.150> are<00:05:23.510> on<00:05:23.720> the

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
it's stupid because if you are on the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.909 
it's stupid because if you are on the
street<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:25.700> see<00:05:25.729> someone<00:05:26.390> and<00:05:26.890> you<00:05:27.890> like

street and you see someone and you like

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.529 
street and you see someone and you like
what<00:05:28.250> they're<00:05:28.340> wearing<00:05:28.550> you<00:05:29.390> might

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
what they're wearing you might

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.060 
what they're wearing you might
complement<00:05:29.960> them<00:05:30.110> right<00:05:30.289> you<00:05:30.470> say<00:05:30.650> hey<00:05:30.860> you
