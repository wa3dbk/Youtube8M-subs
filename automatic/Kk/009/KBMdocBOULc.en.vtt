I<00:00:45.960> threw<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.829> cat<00:00:47.809> silicone<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:48.960> I'm

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I threw just a cat silicone there I'm

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.369 
I threw just a cat silicone there I'm
not<00:00:49.289> sure<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.030> help

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
not sure I don't know just a little help

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.680 
not sure I don't know just a little help
it<00:00:52.379> fit<00:00:52.620> perfect<00:00:53.329> didn't<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> do

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it fit perfect didn't have to do

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.959 
it fit perfect didn't have to do
anything<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.260> only<00:00:55.350> thing<00:00:55.559> I'd<00:00:55.680> recommend

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
anything the only thing I'd recommend

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.920 
anything the only thing I'd recommend
being<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
being that they don't make one for the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
being that they don't make one for the
Titan<00:00:58.260> yet<00:00:58.460> it's<00:00:59.460> probably<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.940> they're

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
Titan yet it's probably because they're

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.349 
Titan yet it's probably because they're
not<00:01:00.359> designed<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.590> him<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.910> fit<00:01:03.120> kit

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
not designed for him but on this fit kit

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
not designed for him but on this fit kit
that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.159> sent<00:01:05.430> me<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that I got that they sent me there was a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
that I got that they sent me there was a
little<00:01:05.939> hole<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> machine<00:01:07.470> hole<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
little hole like a machine hole in it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.970 
could hear the wind and it just didn't
work<00:02:31.000> out<00:02:31.240> great<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> did<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.680> time

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
work out great so what I did this time

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.420 
work out great so what I did this time
is<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.280> brought<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.640> back<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:36.130> I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
is I brought it back and it's it's a I

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.980 
is I brought it back and it's it's a I
brought<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.880> back<00:02:37.000> down<00:02:37.060> around<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.810> went

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
brought it back down around and went

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.390 
brought it back down around and went
underneath<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.470> through<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.770> cab<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.220> what

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
underneath in through the cab but what

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.670 
underneath in through the cab but what
what<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.850> problem<00:02:40.240> was<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.320> reason<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
what the problem was is the reason that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.870 
what the problem was is the reason that
that's<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.160> thick<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.600> 300<00:02:44.230> watt<00:02:44.880> LED

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
that's so thick is that's a 300 watt LED

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.660 
that's so thick is that's a 300 watt LED
which<00:02:46.720> draws<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.350> lot<00:02:47.710> so<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:47.980> couldn't<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.550> use

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
which draws a lot so I couldn't just use

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.390 
which draws a lot so I couldn't just use
regular<00:02:49.170> small<00:02:50.170> wire<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> had<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.040> use<00:02:51.250> an

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
regular small wire I had to use an

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.500 
regular small wire I had to use an
actual<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:52.590> think<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.739> 12<00:02:54.100> or<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:55.330> thing

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
actual I think it was 12 or the thing

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.570 
actual I think it was 12 or the thing
was<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.690> 12<00:02:55.989> gauge<00:02:56.230> or<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> 10<00:02:56.860> gauge<00:02:57.070> wire<00:02:57.340> it

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
was a 12 gauge or a 10 gauge wire it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.170 
was a 12 gauge or a 10 gauge wire it
wasn't<00:02:57.880> too<00:02:58.030> big<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:00.370> had<00:03:00.489> two<00:03:00.580> runs<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.030> way

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
wasn't too big but had two runs that way

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.640 
wasn't too big but had two runs that way
it<00:03:01.300> could<00:03:01.450> withstand<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.170> heat<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
it could withstand the heat and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.140 
it could withstand the heat and
everything<00:03:02.770> from<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> amp<00:03:03.430> drawl<00:03:03.670> off<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
everything from the amp drawl off of it

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.060 
everything from the amp drawl off of it
but<00:03:04.330> other<00:03:05.050> than<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.350> other<00:03:05.680> than<00:03:05.920> working

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
but other than that other than working

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.610 
but other than that other than working
with<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> big<00:03:06.430> wire<00:03:06.820> like<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.750> like<00:03:08.440> it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
with the big wire like that it I like it

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.160 
with the big wire like that it I like it
that<00:03:08.770> thing's<00:03:08.980> bright<00:03:09.340> as<00:03:09.520> hell<00:03:10.170> please

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170
