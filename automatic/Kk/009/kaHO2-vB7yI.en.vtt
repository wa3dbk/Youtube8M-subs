00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.290
 here we are then we start over again 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.860
 let's go back and talk to a bunch of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.180
 ready cards I would say that I use it as never i 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.759
 good mixes before doing 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.040
 the experiment and I do an experiment in 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.820
 which use both are uses is not one 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.770
 nice word but useful use usage 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 indeed of video but I write them on both 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 a shy bunch about half ago 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 to see if about half had so to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 choose it in the two safe half melee 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.730
 the party I'll also explain what we'll do 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.769
 she will choose a card and tula 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.949
 you'll find so many I go to get me one 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.409
 beer is not as bad as what it cuts and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.300
 recompose yourself if you want to put it down 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.640
 cut back to you first now 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.720
 cuts again unbelieving cuts 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.250
 recompose stu you want to cut the components 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 I wanted to tweak t1000 I don't want them 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.899
 touch you blacks now I ask you to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.509
 think a number very often comes into 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.750
 mind of movement of the same numbers as 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 it says yes and I think of course the number 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.020
 37 to ask you to think of a card 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 very often card movement 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.229
 ace of hearts woman of hearts is not 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 always he of whom comes to mind not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.680
 I understand why it's a bit like you see it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350
 think a dress to make if I have to be cheerful 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 just give him that the then cut to 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.719
 we can do it live then 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 so I ask you to keep in mind a 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.310
 number but must be absolutely 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 random so I turn you take less 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.490
 half of the cards and secretly the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.180
 accounts ok 90 that you count tell me about it 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.350
 our shot all the time and london 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.880
 I want to talk though hear how many are 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.580
 so now you have a number in mind 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.549
 I don't want those hidden cards 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.220
 see around is now if I take 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.050
 all these and the rates I could 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.399
 know about how many those are 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.230
 that is but it is not roughly because of me 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.360
 I am subtracted exactly in half the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.420
 we do so always leave a little down 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.069
 ok and you only get 13 which is the exact one 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.130
 half so I know you can't go any further 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.170
 as a number you must remember the card 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.690
 that falls to the position seems that number 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.360
 in certain situations you remember the first 6 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.130
 while you remember the third 6 25 ti 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.350
 remember the fifth if in mind 9 ti 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.340
 remember the ninth 6 while 13 if you have 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.820
 I got it 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.319
 the only blonde who says I count 13 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:53.730
 you don't stop me maybe i understand 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:55.180
 and not looking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.299
 13 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.019
 ok first magic have taken exactly 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.910
 13 of these fortunes has nothing to do with it 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.269
 I turn around put your wants to see 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.519
 how good was the team ok then 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.590
 only you know the card is only you are 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.970
 government you could also 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.100
 roughly if I see why vpro 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.540
 betrayal that I do not know but even if 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.480
 I knew it doesn't change anything because it doesn't 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.799
 I'll find her again, you 'll find yourself why 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.799
 if I 'm not mistaken for you 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.769
 26 casings about the cards as a value 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.230
 go from his to the 13th right insignia 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.570
 we used two cards making their sum 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 we cover all positions well or badly 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.709
 tests to do this raises some 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.239
 cards how much you want to put wrong ok in 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.310
 this way a point of is selected 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.810
 but of course where you selected everything 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.799
 we have to take two other cards 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.230
 possibility 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.460
 the two below the two above or one and one 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:58.690
 as you wish 3 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:02.170
 go this is a jack 11 then 11 3 14 4 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.200
 ok things take both the cards and one for 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:12.640
 one covered with such on the table after the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:16.780
 30 help york 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.340
 racer but this is the right 14 then 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.250
 randomly selected from the number a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.600
 home and cut where you wanted were born 14 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.400
 are three things paper for the first time 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.130
 that eckhart had seen non of cadres the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.830
 bad heart because this is the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.380
 our heart 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.610
 oh mercy a game for everything a game for 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.740
 you all understood 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.740
