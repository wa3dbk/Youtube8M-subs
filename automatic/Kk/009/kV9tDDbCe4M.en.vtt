00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you can't just go around hammering at

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
you can't just go around hammering at
the<00:01:54.810> enemy<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.500> swords<00:01:56.040> gonna<00:01:56.189> break<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
then you have to switch to another one

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.359 
then you have to switch to another one
and<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.320> shows<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.649> broken<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.159> in

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
save it and maybe get a different

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.620 
save it and maybe get a different
loadout<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.270> switch<00:02:43.450> back

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
loadout that you can just switch back

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.060 
loadout that you can just switch back
and<00:02:43.690> forth<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.710> find<00:02:44.920> some

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
and forth to because you find some

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.470 
and forth to because you find some
swords<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.580> really<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.270> you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
swords that you really like and you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360 
swords that you really like and you
can't<00:02:46.690> use<00:02:46.870> all<00:02:46.950> hundred-and-eight<00:02:47.950> at<00:02:48.100> once

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
can't use all hundred-and-eight at once

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.740 
can't use all hundred-and-eight at once
so<00:02:48.580> although<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.060> would<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.270> nice

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
so although that would be nice

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.330 
so although that would be nice
the<00:02:50.050> most<00:02:50.230> annoying<00:02:50.620> thing<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the most annoying thing is that the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340 
the most annoying thing is that the
select<00:02:51.700> button<00:02:51.850> which<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.150> well<00:02:52.540> X<00:02:52.840> they'll
