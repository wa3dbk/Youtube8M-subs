00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.930
 talk welcome and I'm carole cream 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.610
 to come back with you here today on the 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.669
 crÃºzea teaching to make a dessert 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.680
 delicious super practice today the proposal 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.960
 is to make an apple burble for you 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.239
 make this fame you will need 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:36.790
 fresh pasta wheat flour and sugar 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:38.200
 brown sugar white butter nuts and 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.390
 cinnamon 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.579
 we start chopping apples 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.710
 look for apples for a little more 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.839
 acidic the more acidic the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.359
 your apples better will be something else 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.670
 important is the bark question 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.989
 you can keep the shell or can not 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.159
 wear green mask also has no 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.409
 no problem 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.800
 every time you 're using the knife 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.739
 to cut apple tomato fruits that are 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.140
 smooth always seeks to cut first 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.570
 obviously from the outside but in the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.120
 time to make the other cut come by 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.450
 inside because it's easier softer I 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.630
 I like to make apple crown and pear 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 banana and peach realize fresh're in 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.520
 peach season gets very very good 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.619
 but your cuts are in the hour of the people 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.810
 give a little bounce on these 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.430
 here I do not want to put the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.840
 too much fat right now because the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.450
 also has a bit of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.149
 butter so no need actually I 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.100
 I just want a channel that came with this apple. 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.350
 For this I will use a brush because 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.600
 so I make sure I do not use the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.430
 too much fat at the moment what I 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.869
 I want here to raise a little 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.990
 corruption temperature to favor 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.670
 the camera the channeling of these masses 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.850
 It's good since it's yours. 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 and then let's skip this apple 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.810
 I love to mix a little bit of dough 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.310
 green and also those who like raisins 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.500
 some dried fruit goes very well here is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.560
 that we're going to leave that apple 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.710
 caramelized just a little here to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.920
 give a touch we put sugar 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.920
 brown 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.980
 a key thing in all revenue 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.069
 What are you doing at home? 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.420
 today fruit is to work with lemon 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.819
 When we cook fruit and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.189
 especially with the addition of sugar to 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.019
 people steal the fruit the best that she 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.640
 has that its acidity 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.409
 If you do not have a brother, you 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.470
 vinegar time piece of wine 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.200
 white anything to stand out from 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.909
 brings back the ideas that I 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.319
 I'm losing here when I do this. 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:56.920
 corruption process 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:03:01.379
 and here you will notice at home that people 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.930
 already has a wonderful aroma coming out of here 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.180
 caramelized apple 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.489
 it's time to put it on 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.379
 our refractory cinnamon can enter 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.879
 here and can get into the crust I'll go 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.200
 put here we have less 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.200
 information in our guilt 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.420
 and now we put our refractory 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.579
 which is a field is an inverted pie 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.150
 never make a dough of apple pie 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.950
 where I would put these ingredients together 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.940
 flour sugar and butter a mass 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.250
 homogeneous 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.769
 lining the bottom of the shape I'll leave 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.349
 this brittle mass and 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.049
 put over that given my door 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.859
 the nuts they are super complementary 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.859
 in this case what I do of texture I 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.750
 I'll put some of the whole nuts 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.909
 here along with the apples 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.829
 This will check it out for you. 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.000
 you're eating that same texture 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.400
 chestnut 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.670
 the other part I tap along with the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.030
 other ingredients and here it is enough to 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.030
 wheat flour 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.200
 white sugar 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.020
 I do not have the ice cream 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.690
 it's vital that you keep it well 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.330
 cold 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.860
 if she does not have what's going to happen 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.950
 that this mass instead of 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.510
 and it will be all pasty and 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.180
 then we will have an effect with what the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.530
 people and, last but not least, our 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.450
 remembering that nuts are optional if 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:56.680
 You do not want to not have it in your house. 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:05:00.070
 can do without problems and this is very 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.660
 fast is a matter of seconds 20 and 30 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.360
 seconds we'll get this our 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.850
 I think it's a good road. 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.860
 small pieces of butter beaten with 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:20.490
 sugar and nuts 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:20.490
 now look people dump over 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.830
 you will not believe without pressing another 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.630
 what do people do for the love of squeezing 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.280
 has nothing to push because in the 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.330
 Truth is the end meal, she's fine. 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.140
 I knew well crunchy is super simple, 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.370
 now we can take it to the oven 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.950
 all care is little at this moment 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.080
 because the apples she had small 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.690
 here in the pot and we do not 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.460
 want that too much soft mass then 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.830
 oven must be as high as possible 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.630
 so that we can leave this 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.100
 very golden dough 5 100 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.020
 excessively the apple 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.360
 so it is important that the fire is already 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.360
 preheated at a temperature around 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.490
 230 degrees at home if you do not 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.710
 have oven temperature control 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:12.170
 strong let's see it's just put 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.480
 according to frontin 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.450
 now we 'll have 20 minutes and the pie 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.380
 It will be beautiful, all gold on top and 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.380
 with the masses banks
