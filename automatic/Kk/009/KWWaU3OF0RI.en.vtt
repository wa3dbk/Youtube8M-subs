00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
and how that works is this time line you

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.220 
and how that works is this time line you
get<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.520> cable<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.690> plug<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:45.960> into

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
get this cable and you plug it into

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.770
