00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.959
 so for day it's as donations for the second part 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.860
 youtube's videos 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.489
 Besides, we learn about this uprising 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.029
 so the world we always have the same hand with the frames that are ready 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.349
 to a failure to leave per child at the end of the points part 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.179
 so these videos save us from the people a world more really tried to 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.929
 explain everything 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.869
 could you explain retailers 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.119
 lack 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.489
 a year ago that if we changed more videos m 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.509
 as soon as the time to search for a pub dismount the demand is less than I 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.720
 do not heaven 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.870
 there are no worries as explained - so here are young people going 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.760
 possible 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.250
 so the posei reason that these boats are moved motivated him so we 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.880
 let's think in candles about us 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.690
 and so the following objects 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.310
 so present his paintings and put me grab hold of the move while the 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.660
 fashion compounds that will also move inches 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.330
 but if I pass 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.700
 meditate model she will not move see the post will not move sorry 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.840
 so that there she was even millions of curious 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.810
 not happy when ironing for them a man who knows 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960
 we see for example 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.220
 already raise your work on is not saved a year so that me by 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.299
 example it's my case I did not know how to keep my job it's true that I 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.970
 been badly done my job sorry 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.430
 so that's an important thing 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.760
 the stake but the Germans have insured because this magnificent so here is the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.460
 pump has more recent mature 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.320
 so what are we doing a tube without a backgammon frame 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.700
 we did not expect her to move your objects by herself 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.990
 so the same time does it to mathieu system helps to move our 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.620
 characters more easily 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.790
 and when recorded leffrinckoucke fourmaux will celebrate the meaning where the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.220
 crime if you do not understand this notion 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.730
 so that's no I know very well that with thorel success 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.720
 in the end when you have always mastered 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 some have fun at the end of the night with the examination of a cure 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.800
 so that's all we do together but here it is 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.560
 so I think that I will not learn how to actually do I can with my other 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 members 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 not that yes because for now it's not very hard to say that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.139
 his efforts to understand the principles 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.579
 so the world 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.029
 after the games but very often the better a customization I did too much 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.969
 it's a hand that makes for my club 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.639
 who walks here we do not know so simple to do 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.689
 so cisse he wanted both worlds to know how to do I would put it 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.159
 in fire 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.469
 the top on the wear in more than a year 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.509
 so here we will start 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.819
 so already we do not believe in a bar of Frejus election 0 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.439
 so we'll already saved 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.539
 all information about lots in kind 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.389
 so we click on the concrete reinforcements it is especially not with the key not 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.059
 everything has to be blue like this site 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.299
 now we see that it touches half-time 14 yet cast the keys of 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.049
 contact with the pros so his fresh stripes a 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.999
 and for coughing his hire of his son which means 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:03:00.379
 rental rotation that's how it's a strong point we need the most 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.870
 important this with the block we vote because she 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 the aoc knew to say 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.130
 localized and there hop roth so she rotates the rotation and so that's 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.979
 size 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.539
 so percent so here we go also from the rotation and the size of the objects 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.369
 so here we can add one so for example 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.289
 we can for example I am like you I will not complain about the behavior 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.740
 when we will not come there 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.439
 the three formations were confiscated 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.870
 so not so we add a premium to befits the mountain at the end because we 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:32.360
 change a key forgiveness 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.030
 there is information that has been recorded 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.550
 of this key the afp if they recorded until she did 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.449
 and it's the new information that will take over 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.629
 we always try to make a class easier to kill because that 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.109
 really exist 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.109
 so for that we will start our animation 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.040
 So here we are not a year since we recorded all that 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.869
 we recorded christine pestle 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.669
 and will not be able to present the show not 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.809
 we can choose paris otherwise 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.499
 when directly click here on 20 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.499
 so here I am often 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.469
 so what are we doing now she's just going 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.839
 to select 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.859
 this site is a vivid example our finger 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.250
 so for those who can not use the frames it's weird 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.129
 MONUC 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.069
 but by the way when we use rotations and its terraces can do 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.229
 really realistic 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.680
 op 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.090
 amp like this and that's our first real foot 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.159
 so obviously 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.330
 on the ground it's not very pretty but good 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.499
 for his client 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.520
 this part if my job can be widely here and there 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.049
 to get something more realistic in this rather particular context 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.909
 the ump 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.400
 she is getting used to it do not worry about any sugar clause or 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:47.900
 more precisely more carney 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.900
 things we like are no longer there 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.789
 now our first vote is folded so 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:56.699
 in fact 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.309
 so it started and here we go 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.309
 we select our dozens of civilians 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.099
 it is not against you that I fix tomorrow 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.199
 do not worry about access for the buyer and the people 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.330
 why this super funny 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.509
 It's awesome 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.320
 that's a problem affecting more change to strain plans like you 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.460
 want 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.250
 so that natixis bank if not how to just do we'll all try with 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.250
 complaints for getting started on his blog 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.090
 and yet no more the key says to criticize them in all cases what 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.879
 what did the whole critic do 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.879
 and well here is our direction so she rode around the ground frequent 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.159
 11 euros 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.159
 Cadets do not miss out for our animations 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.089
 mistake it's great 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:03.009
 in any case it was just to create an easy animation with less 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.009
 knowing that most of you are here to do it 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.879
 - even if I am free I prefer that we do not believe 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.710
 here also to criticize% u that a meeting of this group and video is 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:16.199
 not worth it no it's just like that it's 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.619
 it's purely pedagogic holy so 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.990
 this is really a nation of asia that has done with one hand 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.339
 so 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.989
 So here is the course on the frames are surely finishing in four 

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:33.759
 years after having often attacked 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.020
 you manage your character all alone in my heart starting the court on 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.360
 paws and human 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.880
 then on 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.730
 the frames in Corsican I think I'll do a full week on the 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.339
 armatures 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.509
 going through the beaches so here's a it was useful and 3d and thanks to 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.800
 watch this video especially subscribe know really pleasure 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:55.869
 so here's a brief thing like this here is ap give yourself 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.689
 So here is 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.689
 I'll even do a little animation 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.399
 Beaurevoir 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.830
 here 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.479
 he can there 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.569
 remember that the ctt micro dice we review 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.729
 now we can say goodbye it's magic 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.360
 So that's him 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.219
 pilgrims according to the index and videos
