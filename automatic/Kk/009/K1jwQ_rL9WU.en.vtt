00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.870
 at these famous hogs notice jensen elections have cause for worry 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.100
 the first debate in canada and that it can be prescribed to about 62% 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.809
 for the first semester 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 - henri delinquency stephano 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.800
 the elections hate each other 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.070
 and then the first one overflows 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.110
 the physio in the presence of party leaders% and on the national scene 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.850
 Sixty score would avoid trudeau qualifying and other percent in May 2011 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.920
 having served at the restaurant 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 Fernand Theriault I I think it's a cartoon 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.830
 80th 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.830
 a welcome and another vehicle than the first of the ports 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.840
 thor is useful 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 m step it was clear 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.310
 hours in many passerby desjoyeaux was the hectare why 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.230
 go the leaders' debates 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 and if he is a wearer or why it is so important 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.220
 she should not be surprised who exerts think that one can not imagine their 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.719
 share an election campaign in 2011 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.940
 five points does not involve a conspiracy but without the help of the banks 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.230
 beautiful star 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.870
 the second is that we must also say that now it is rare 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.720
 groups who who have their assets dresses us the electoral woes 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.819
 you have for example 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.389
 for all those who work for the different political parties who this wine 

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:07.130
 organized their TV campaign 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 the strategy reached merchant banks after its strategy after 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.789
 study the debate 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.279
 we do not have the journalists and media people who expect him to have 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.199
 a debate and then receive the organized our activities before the debate at the 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.969
 Maple Leaf 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.899
 and that finally she too voters 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.329
 and as often in our beings that is a way for us the harbor 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.000
 forced to the world 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.860
 the challenges of giving me an opinion maybe to better understand 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.970
 what are the levers of injection the people need 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.920
 it's also a way of knowing what a cyst was trusting 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.600
 said to have dispatched without the 3d effect is nothing without celebrating 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.210
 and that people also forget the mails carrying this season after along the 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.760
 ribs it's also developing 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.750
 and what he did not really see an answer 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.540
 but precisely the debates have existed since what fifty years 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.879
 now I imagine that over the hours 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.109
 there were 40 40 debates that marked a campaign that was 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.120
 arrested in iran for a campaign 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
 it's the deadliest that can only come from mind 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.910
 for our health solutions of all if he felt 2 was one of the points 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.860
 disastrous for daniel giants sounds is that the companion of the receiver 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.029
 did not believe in television 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.180
 for him a campaign because to this agreement there 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.959
 go meet lonely area as long as they were poorly prepared as long as 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.439
 vice president he took off his glasses he put back his glasses rodez 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.970
 result 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.600
 does zhu know that the monopoly hands ugly but the pockets of his fln coat and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.599
 I did not know what to accept it is a disaster 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.799
 995pts people remember that the exchanges between them 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.120
 I held the pen this new impact rushing his absence 80 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.599
 minutes 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.150
 alassane 84 it was the rooms on the 9th the famous key moments are dead or have 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.520
 been maintained 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.090
 do you know that in 1945 - hervé novelli chose his city to be a symbolic place 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.510
 was judged for choice I as he is 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.779
 and as you say you are first you had the choice 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.529
 so at 80 and the canine king club spinach 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.469
 an hour later before celebrating 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.489
 as you mentioned famous election on free trade and the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.800
 accused content no border even if it is said to have done before the day j 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.510
 the sovereignty of having abandoned the safety of elevators reach 188 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.990
 well-off people when rapa nai but we're here to bring but 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.850
 what we see in the days following the campaign is that the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.590
 cinema 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.309
 have people insisted 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:25.830
 people while 910 listen I think I'm right to vote when we 

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:26.610
 aspen 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.860
 go see them change a mobilization of his supporters because the circles 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.199
 business intervened because we felt the unbearable cauldron 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.249
 Saintéloc 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.440
 investments 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 and he knows so much before 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.159
 it will be no longer there 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.510
 to remind people when veterinary free trade an issue 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.530
 Very important 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.290
 last week then this debate leaders at nanterre where he will have in 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.750
 yet patassé woman pointed out the high price of automata ap 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.360
 for the first time that a woman is beating an interview he had 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.130
 even a point in the 90's it's the early 80's that it's 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.919
 does having a woman in a leaders' debate 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.539
 does this experience mean that 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.490
 it is perceived in the same way 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.620
 the unfortunate on the a7 and the judgments are always more severe said 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.860
 victim 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.219
 for example 93 'woman depends 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.069
 with what is far away 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.499
 they found that the victim who is british a lot toro favorite 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:20.110
 right here 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.130
 he is uncertain for this game too much it's too much this state of a woman 1 7% and 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.059
 when we had the idea in the context of tests 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:29.150
 with him 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.000
 there the Shiite NDP party leader who I believe is Alex mcleish a 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.379
 review of its value 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.259
 far from our Mauritanian people salah beakir memory 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.719
 and the answer is nobody was much more the lawsuit these 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.839
 people is not very aggressive in the etchemins she has for now 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:46.940
 do the game 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.960
 as long as studies show 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.550
 but unfortunately a limit 6 eur 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.189
 they are much more severe with a lot of a performance 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.549
 with the part of a woman it was too dry and enough troops 

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:00.599
 sylvie roussel of the past years 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.989
 hannibal and his last wife on TV it can sometimes be elected 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.479
 and often the services finch com 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.230
 5arras his kitchen with shame 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.020
 she was born not to debate and dvd stakes of the campaign it is often said 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.100
 that's debates and televised leaders scm a debate leaders nb this art 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.999
 to make their choice 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:22.160
 for me it may be the big paradox that 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.639
 we live on the one hand 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.969
 his novel renaud deschamps mentioned astonish that they know we can not 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.319
 more imagine a campaign will do without a garbage dump 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.699
 others not 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.540
 whenever the debates 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.330
 we are always happy 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.520
 from here from time to time voters say that I listened to the debate 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.119
 preliminary I close my Basque TV 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.899
 the people there was the fair of grabbed we understood nothing forgotten 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:47.969
 everyone knows that it is but above all what is criticized is that the 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.629
 hero politicians is to sleep we are back of who was going to ask a 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:56.929
 question and nervous prevenes thank you very much e sir canada mattel and 

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:58.639
 then bang 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.039
 take advantage of this course question 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.509
 as they say in English 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.430
 as for the time the examination of the marsa there so it's a little mouth the big 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.319
 paradox 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.279
 his troubles 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.800
 wash the bulls 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.729
 for my part of course I listened as of September 25 schools 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.800
 missing I'm going to be a little disappointed once the Complainant has acquiesced in less 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.990
 we are prepared to try to assess whether it has been related to that by the 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.919
 next week thank you very much m simoneau paid in part per month
