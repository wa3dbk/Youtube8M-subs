manages<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> conversation<00:01:09.030> he<00:01:09.420> gets

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
manages to have a conversation he gets

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.289 
manages to have a conversation he gets
to<00:01:09.750> speak<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.549> makes<00:01:11.820> me<00:01:12.090> believe

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to speak and so this makes me believe

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
to speak and so this makes me believe
that<00:01:12.600> he<00:01:12.840> took<00:01:13.110> god<00:01:13.290> technically<00:01:13.860> isn't<00:01:14.159> dead

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that he took god technically isn't dead

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
that he took god technically isn't dead
like<00:01:15.390> he<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:15.930> possibly<00:01:16.080> come<00:01:16.560> back<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.100> he

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
like he could possibly come back if he

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
like he could possibly come back if he
can<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> rational<00:01:17.970> thought<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> like

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can have a rational thought I like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.109 
can have a rational thought I like
speech<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.470> talk<00:01:19.680> I'm<00:01:19.979> guessing<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> most

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
speech or talk I'm guessing that most

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.810 
speech or talk I'm guessing that most
likely<00:01:21.630> kurosu<00:01:22.049> Chi<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.439> save<00:01:22.740> him<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.189> bring

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
likely kurosu Chi can save him and bring

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.399 
likely kurosu Chi can save him and bring
him<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.330> being<00:01:24.570> zombiefied<00:01:25.020> that's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
him back from being zombiefied that's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
him back from being zombiefied that's
exactly<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.860> I'm<00:01:25.950> thinking<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.369> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
exactly what I'm thinking right now but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.109 
exactly what I'm thinking right now but
