about the left-hand Lane

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.559 
about the left-hand Lane
well<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.459> left-hand<00:02:47.790> Lane<00:02:47.880> was<00:02:48.090> tighter<00:02:48.299> for

me in practice and right at the end the
right<00:02:50.280> lane<00:02:50.459> tightened<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.910> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.299> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
right lane tightened up a little bit and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.960 
right lane tightened up a little bit and
I<00:02:51.840> thought<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.200> through<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.670> decent<00:02:53.670> shot<00:02:53.760> knees

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
I thought it through a decent shot knees

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.729 
I thought it through a decent shot knees
for<00:02:54.209> him<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.540> had<00:02:54.660> tied<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.260> tense<00:02:55.560> frame

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
for him and it had tied in a tense frame

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.050 
for him and it had tied in a tense frame
I<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.040> make<00:02:56.370> sure<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.700> through<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
I so just make sure you get through it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.280 
I so just make sure you get through it
and<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> thought<00:02:57.330> I'd<00:02:57.480> feel<00:02:57.569> pretty<00:02:57.630> decent<00:02:58.170> but

and I thought I'd feel pretty decent but

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.470 
and I thought I'd feel pretty decent but
it<00:02:58.410> still<00:02:58.590> hooked<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.890> man<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.430> got<00:03:00.090> two<00:03:00.299> bad

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
had a couple of wringing tens which

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.699 
had a couple of wringing tens which
