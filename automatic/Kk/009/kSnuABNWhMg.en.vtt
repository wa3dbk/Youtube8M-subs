in the chin I also don't like the fact
that<00:03:06.660> there's<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.430> what<00:03:08.430> does<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.850> just

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
there's a little seam right there but

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.140 
there's a little seam right there but
the<00:03:15.990> coloring<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.410> really<00:03:16.860> nice<00:03:17.010> i<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the coloring is really nice i like the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.960

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
there's the back of the figure even if

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.440 
there's the back of the figure even if
you<00:03:29.010> don't<00:03:29.520> know<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.000> even<00:03:30.090> really

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you don't know if you can even really

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.740 
you don't know if you can even really
constitute<00:03:30.960> as<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.140> figure<00:03:31.520> cape<00:03:32.520> though<00:03:32.790> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
constitute as a figure cape though the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.570 
constitute as a figure cape though the
hair<00:03:33.990> this<00:03:34.800> feels<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.340> hollow<00:03:37.580> hollow

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
hair this feels like it is hollow hollow

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.620 
hair this feels like it is hollow hollow
hollow<00:03:38.910> piece<00:03:39.740> but<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:41.209> don't<00:03:42.209> know<00:03:42.330> there's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
hollow piece but I don't know there's

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.220 
hollow piece but I don't know there's
something<00:03:42.959> about<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.740> really<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:45.230> it's

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
something about it I really like it's

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.610 
something about it I really like it's
just<00:03:47.090> obviously<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.300> art<00:03:48.570> if<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.320> can<00:03:49.440> call

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
just obviously it's art if you can call

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.699 
just obviously it's art if you can call
it<00:03:49.680> art<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:51.390> will<00:03:51.660> really<00:03:51.870> serve<00:03:52.230> no<00:03:52.500> purpose

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
it art it will really serve no purpose

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.830 
it art it will really serve no purpose
other<00:03:53.010> than<00:03:53.160> maybe<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.640> sit<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:53.910> your<00:03:54.209> shelf<00:03:54.540> or

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
that you could just have this on a table

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.080 
that you could just have this on a table
somewhere<00:04:15.840> even<00:04:16.739> if<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.190> doesn't<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:17.700> anything

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
somewhere even if it doesn't do anything

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.409 
somewhere even if it doesn't do anything
even<00:04:19.020> if<00:04:19.109> what<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.440> does<00:04:19.680> or<00:04:20.040> what<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:21.120> doing

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
even if what it does or what it's doing

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.070 
even if what it does or what it's doing
right<00:04:21.600> now<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:21.989> all<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.440> does<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> node

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
right now is all it does this is a node

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.159 
right now is all it does this is a node
there's<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.590> real<00:04:26.690> personality<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.840> think

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169

to<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:30.530> as<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.680> mentioned<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:32.160> really

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
to this and as I mentioned it's really

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.420 
to this and as I mentioned it's really
not<00:04:32.520> everyone's<00:04:33.240> thing<00:04:33.650> but<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.980> really

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
not everyone's thing but if you really

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.940 
not everyone's thing but if you really
like<00:04:35.669> just<00:04:35.970> um<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.479> don't<00:04:37.440> know<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.919> just

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.450 

I<00:04:41.639> can't<00:04:42.000> even<00:04:42.180> really<00:04:42.300> think<00:04:42.599> of<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.720> word

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
I can't even really think of the word

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.980 
I can't even really think of the word

just like a real artsy piece that you

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.200

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.860 
think for me like this really just has a
real<00:04:50.819> retro<00:04:52.129> feel<00:04:53.129> to<00:04:53.159> it<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.759> for<00:04:54.569> that<00:04:54.599> i

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
real retro feel to it and for that i

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.680 
real retro feel to it and for that i
really<00:04:55.259> like<00:04:55.470> these<00:04:55.650> i<00:04:56.270> really<00:04:57.270> really<00:04:57.389> do

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
believe also i think big bad toy store

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.350 
believe also i think big bad toy store
had<00:05:04.889> these<00:05:05.039> as<00:05:05.190> well<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.819> probably<00:05:06.120> could

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
had these as well you probably could

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.390 
had these as well you probably could
also<00:05:06.479> go<00:05:06.659> to<00:05:06.720> some<00:05:07.349> specialty<00:05:07.830> stores<00:05:08.159> and

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
also go to some specialty stores and

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.740 
also go to some specialty stores and
find<00:05:08.699> these<00:05:08.879> two<00:05:11.300> definitely<00:05:12.300> don't<00:05:12.449> overlook

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
find these two definitely don't overlook

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.270 
find these two definitely don't overlook
the<00:05:12.900> fact<00:05:12.930> though<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:13.379> they<00:05:13.740> are<00:05:13.860> just<00:05:14.099> very

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
the fact though that they are just very

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.350 
the fact though that they are just very
basic<00:05:15.020> block<00:05:16.020> figures<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.430> think<00:05:18.180> there's

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
basic block figures I think there's

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.210 
basic block figures I think there's
really<00:05:18.509> a<00:05:18.630> lot<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.990> personality<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.650> be<00:05:19.889> set
