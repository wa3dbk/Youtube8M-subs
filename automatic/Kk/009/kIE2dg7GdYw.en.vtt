00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
is this this is the cord pitchblack

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.570 
is this this is the cord pitchblack
tuner<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.660> personally<00:00:13.500> use<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.040> every<00:00:14.280> gig

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
funk or soul every single time and so I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.109 
funk or soul every single time and so I
just<00:00:23.220> wanted<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.460> give<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> quick<00:00:23.880> little

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
just wanted to give you a quick little

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.089 
just wanted to give you a quick little
demo<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.050> works<00:00:25.230> reason<00:00:25.800> why<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
demo on how it works reason why they I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
demo on how it works reason why they I
recommend<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> pitch<00:00:27.090> black<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:27.990> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
recommend the pitch black is because it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.310 
recommend the pitch black is because it
actively<00:00:28.470> grades<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.189> tone<00:00:29.990> on<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> letter

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
actively grades your tone on a letter

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
actively grades your tone on a letter
grade<00:00:31.470> scale<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.040> being<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> best<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:32.910> being

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
grade scale a being the best at being

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.010 
grade scale a being the best at being
the<00:00:33.480> worst

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the worst

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
the worst
and<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.040> right<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.760> just

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and so what I've got right now is just

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290 
and so what I've got right now is just
turn<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> pedals<00:00:37.500> off<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.969> we'll<00:00:39.149> just

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
turn the pedals off and so we'll just

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
turn the pedals off and so we'll just
get<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.050> P<00:00:40.230> bass<00:00:40.410> I've<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.040> going

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
get the the P bass I've got here going

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.280 
get the the P bass I've got here going
straight<00:00:41.850> into<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> amp

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.840 

so<00:00:48.290> that's<00:00:48.470> just<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.770> raw<00:00:48.920> p-bass<00:00:49.310> sound<00:00:49.640> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
so that's just the raw p-bass sound and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.870 
so that's just the raw p-bass sound and
the<00:00:50.030> pitch<00:00:50.570> black<00:00:50.840> will<00:00:51.080> tell<00:00:51.380> me<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:52.130> it's

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
the pitch black will tell me that it's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.240 
the pitch black will tell me that it's
about<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.180> C<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:53.989> that's<00:00:54.170> average<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:54.980> decent

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
about a C so that's average it's decent

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.240 
about a C so that's average it's decent
it's<00:00:55.670> not<00:00:55.790> horrible<00:00:56.590> but<00:00:57.590> if<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.860> turn

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
it's not horrible but if I turn

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.240 
it's not horrible but if I turn
something<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:58.760> for<00:00:59.030> example<00:00:59.390> this<00:00:59.480> compressor

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
something on for example this compressor

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.830 
something on for example this compressor
say<00:01:01.250> with<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:04.000> kind<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.089> smooth<00:01:05.360> things<00:01:05.570> out<00:01:05.780> of

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
say with it kind of smooth things out of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.930 
say with it kind of smooth things out of
it<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.320> pitch<00:01:06.530> black<00:01:06.830> tells<00:01:07.190> me<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.700> I'm

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
it the pitch black tells me that I'm

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.210 
it the pitch black tells me that I'm
full<00:01:08.900> letter<00:01:09.140> grade<00:01:09.229> jump<00:01:09.710> that's<00:01:09.920> pretty

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
full letter grade jump that's pretty

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.400 
full letter grade jump that's pretty
good<00:01:10.460> just<00:01:10.760> off<00:01:10.910> of<00:01:10.940> one<00:01:11.210> pedal<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:12.229> went

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
good just off of one pedal so we went

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.950 
good just off of one pedal so we went
from<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.680> CD<00:01:12.890> with<00:01:13.070> B<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.270> if<00:01:14.360> we<00:01:14.450> engage<00:01:14.600> my

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
from a CD with B but if we engage my

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.230 
from a CD with B but if we engage my
favorite<00:01:15.440> pedal<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.130> VP<00:01:16.520> bass<00:01:16.760> I<00:01:17.090> use

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
favorite pedal this is the VP bass I use

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:27.960 
favorite pedal this is the VP bass I use
this<00:01:17.390> all<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.660> time<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.920> pitch<00:01:25.070> black<00:01:26.800> oh

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
this all the time and the pitch black oh

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.300 
this all the time and the pitch black oh
holy<00:01:28.970> crap<00:01:29.330> yeah<00:01:29.750> almost<00:01:30.649> getting<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.070> perfect

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
holy crap yeah almost getting a perfect

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.910 
holy crap yeah almost getting a perfect
aim<00:01:31.700> my<00:01:31.970> tone<00:01:32.420> can<00:01:32.690> literally<00:01:33.200> not<00:01:33.440> get<00:01:33.710> any

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
aim my tone can literally not get any

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.650 
aim my tone can literally not get any
better<00:01:34.130> from<00:01:34.369> here<00:01:34.610> on<00:01:34.789> out<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.330> can<00:01:35.479> see

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
better from here on out so you can see

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.850 
better from here on out so you can see
why<00:01:35.810> something<00:01:36.110> like<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.410> would<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.560> useful

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
why something like that would be useful

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.310 
why something like that would be useful
I<00:01:37.190> show<00:01:37.430> up<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.700> give<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.450> quarter<00:01:39.140> pitch

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
I show up to give the the quarter pitch

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.080 
I show up to give the the quarter pitch
black<00:01:39.530> gives<00:01:39.800> me<00:01:39.950> feedback<00:01:40.310> on<00:01:40.670> how<00:01:40.789> good<00:01:40.970> my

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
black gives me feedback on how good my

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.880 
black gives me feedback on how good my
tone<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.050> can<00:01:42.259> make<00:01:42.350> some<00:01:42.380> little<00:01:42.740> tweaks

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
tone is so I can make some little tweaks

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.800 
tone is so I can make some little tweaks
up<00:01:43.160> onstage<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.820> make<00:01:43.940> sure<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.270> get<00:01:44.390> an<00:01:44.570> a
