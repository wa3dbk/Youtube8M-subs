00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.810
 hi electric guys with a new one 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.850
 video 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.619
 sorry second step to miss a little 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.120
 late 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.280
 then in this video I wanted to do him 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.539
 see download the tech launch on mac 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.529
 as you see when the is already understood 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.910
 file judging by its thousand leaves 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.360
 before our folder we have two files 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 these you must open this first 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 us yellow but the one above that with the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:53.579
 logo 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:56.249
 cover very good here 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.890
 then the idea of updating them you do harm 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:04.229
 screw we don't worry it's not a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.380
 guide for the three always enough alone 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.119
 almost do what I read 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.119
 just to make the folder forever 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 library because I can't stand it 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.630
 as you can see, he loaded the muse 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.909
 technical folder to launch the first of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:33.740
 file what we need to do take the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:41.369
 this is jar file miss and in practice 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 widow to copy and paste it here 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.610
 now you can open this one for later 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.850
 rather, to close it the risk it is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:00.080
 we do as a teacher must say for the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.080
 support was missing from your one ok package 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:18.760
 ok ok once and what we need 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.650
 open of france 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.800
 as you can see it was some of the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:35.230
 folders you have to play with our luca 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:42.959
 missing where it is convenient will not win life of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.959
 basile does the register and vlc roads 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:13.910
 here meanwhile it is limited to clicks 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:19.270
 do you or the studio do not think I 'm wrong 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.270
 okay respected the steps 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:33.420
 keep has created a technical folder 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:37.920
 spi i am doing see after that 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.990
 they have finished loading then girls 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.020
 is down here a few fifteen 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.020
 minutes did not add that it will open 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.260
 but do everything right here 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.769
 the part that if you want me to escape into 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:23.109
 no drugs 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.920
 but 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.480
 here you see them part of the world 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.900
 all 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.900
 here the world is created 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.020
 you see everything well immediately, even various 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.020
 pieces 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.060
 but there is this how it works 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.020
 let's make it a goal 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.020
 here 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:06.850
 maybe we are a destination where there is local 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:10.480
 also change the texture should be 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:15.810
 here with the pasted had been the 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.810
 pack us click around 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.870
 as you can see, it is not the same as before 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:37.040
 just that this morning of a graphic 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:40.810
 better to understand things better below 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.810
 decisions of all things 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:53.900
 ok to take another thing 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:07:03.290
 maybe you should leave 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:06.650
 let master make options now 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:10.640
 Mom, I 'm not going to take them this month 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:17.140
 called and let me cover this 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:19.610
 month with the participants projected give ok 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.560
 as you can see now it will not help us to 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.560
 put my charge like that 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.610
 then guys with these won it all in 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.150
 walking boot for joining the 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.150
 next
