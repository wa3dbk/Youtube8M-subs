thumb I strong as hard as I did before
there's<00:02:28.910> not<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> chance<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.900> kids<00:02:30.110> are

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
there's not a chance that the kids are

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.289 
there's not a chance that the kids are
going<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> hear<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.650> now

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.550 

so<00:02:38.299> I've<00:02:38.540> done<00:02:38.689> how<00:02:38.780> many<00:02:38.959> decibels<00:02:39.230> that's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.610 
so I've done how many decibels that's
taken<00:02:39.890> down<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.900> guess<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.049> taking<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.439> back

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620
