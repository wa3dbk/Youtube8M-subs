00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.590
Imagine for a moment that you have
millions of dollars in the bank.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.120
Now imagine that you never spend
a dime of it and live in poverty.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.960
Are you rich?
Yes.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.060
But if you don’t enjoy your riches, then, in your
practical experience, it’s as if you have nothing.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.120
As believers, we’ve received Christ.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.780
But God’s intention isn’t just for us to have Christ;
it’s for us to enjoy Him to the uttermost.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.320
Many of us find that the joy we experienced
when we first received Christ can fade away.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.220
But the Bible shows us how we can
maintain the joy of our salvation.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.340
First, we can confess our sins.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.780
1 John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.260
He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins
and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.920
As soon as we confess our sins,
the blood of Jesus cleanses us.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.060
By this, our fellowship with Christ—
the source of our joy—is restored.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
Second, we can feed on God’s Word.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.420
Jeremiah 15:16 says, “Your words
were found and I ate them,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.620
and Your word became to me
the gladness and joy of my heart.”

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.360
It’s hard to be joyful when we’re hungry.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.860
But when we pray over God’s Word to eat it as spiritual
food, it nourishes, satisfies, and makes us glad.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.000
Third, we can pray.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.440
John 16:24 says, “Ask and you shall receive,
that your joy may be made full.”

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.820
When we pour out our heart to the Lord in prayer,
the things that weigh us down are lifted

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.100
and we sense a deep joy and refreshment.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.000
Finally, we can fellowship with
others who love the Lord.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.480
First John 1:3-4 says, “That you also
may have fellowship with us,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.700
and indeed our fellowship is with the
Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.580
And these things we write
that our joy may be made full.”

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.800
The greatest enjoyment for a Christian is to
be with others who love and enjoy Christ.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.540
Our salvation is like a rock
that can never be shaken.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.960
But the joy of our salvation is like a delicate
flower that needs to be cultivated every day.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.720
By practicing to confess our sins,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.720
feed on God’s Word, pray to the Lord,
and fellowship with other Christians,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.820
we’ll enjoy Christ and live a joyful Christian life.
