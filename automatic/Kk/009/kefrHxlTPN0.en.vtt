00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone, Andrey Andreyev 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.970
 Andreevich my site all-all point ru 1370 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.780
 first task 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.849
 Kohl Petya 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.080
 Zhenya and Senya weighed on scales 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.830
 the results were 37 and 742 and 539 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.439
 barely 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.560
 and 48 kilograms find the mass of each 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 boy if it is known that Kohl is heavier 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 canopy 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 but it is easier to sing and Zhenya easier to let 7 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 in order so you know 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.600
 Kolya is heavier than blue let you 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:51.030
 it will be more difficult for blue than ours 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.230
 heavier kolya heavier than a canopy but drink easier 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.760
 Means sing harder than Kohl turns 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.020
 that sing and harder if 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 and if heavier than hay and burning 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.840
 lighter canopy everything is not the easiest of these 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:13.979
 three but he is heavier than his wife 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 even lighter than hay hay lighter kali kali 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.869
 easier to drink and my wife is easier than senin that he 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.180
 the easiest well and we have vis-a-vis 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.909
 Well then we can distribute the weight of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 order the biggest weight is at forty 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.140
 two and a half kilograms is Petr 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 42 and a half kilograms 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 down the order we have 40 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 kilogram 40 point 80 kilogram this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 It turns out to be further in order with us 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:57.170
 is 39.2 kilograms it turns out senya 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:02.040
 and 37 7 37 as much as 70 kilograms and also not 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.229
 that is here and so well, that these figures 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.850
 order is very easy to arrange 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.420
 a lot less weight even less 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.690
 small petya 42 and a half kilograms 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:19.330
 Kohl 40 kilogram 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.250
 and 8 tenths of hay 39.2 kilograms and Zhenya 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.520
 37.7 kilograms 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.520
 that's the whole problem on this all bye
