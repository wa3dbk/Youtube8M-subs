00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
time a stitch is taken and so we are

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.449 
time a stitch is taken and so we are
going<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.200> want<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> add<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> little<00:02:12.860> oil<00:02:13.069> to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
going to want to add a little oil to

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.980 
going to want to add a little oil to
that<00:02:13.790> edge

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
that edge

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.230 
that edge
along<00:02:15.140> there<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.860> couple<00:02:16.040> drops<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.700> then

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
along there just a couple drops and then

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.300 
along there just a couple drops and then
once<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:17.990> start<00:02:18.290> running<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.980> will<00:02:19.160> help

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
once we start running it that will help

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.280 
once we start running it that will help
disperse<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:20.030> as<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.360> goes<00:02:20.540> you're<00:02:21.200> gonna

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
disperse it as it goes you're gonna

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.780 
disperse it as it goes you're gonna
actually<00:02:21.500> see<00:02:21.860> when<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.130> turn<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.430> handwheel

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
actually see when you turn the handwheel

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.240 
actually see when you turn the handwheel
you<00:02:23.000> see<00:02:23.180> kind<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.540> half<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.170> moon<00:02:24.380> turning

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you see kind of a half of a moon turning

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.000 
you see kind of a half of a moon turning
now<00:02:25.460> okay<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:26.420> as<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.960> goes<00:02:27.140> back<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.530> forth

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
now okay so as that goes back and forth

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.630 
now okay so as that goes back and forth
it<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.410> oscillating<00:02:30.410> hook<00:02:30.770> system<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.520> it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
it is a oscillating hook system so it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.790 
it is a oscillating hook system so it
oscillates<00:02:32.210> back<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.480> forth<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.350> does<00:02:33.560> this

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
oscillates back and forth so does this

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.980 
oscillates back and forth so does this
it<00:02:34.010> goes<00:02:34.130> back<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.700> forth<00:02:34.730> rocks<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.840> what

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
it goes back and forth rocks so what

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
it goes back and forth rocks so what
we're<00:02:36.110> gonna<00:02:36.170> do<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.770> sometimes<00:02:37.190> here<00:02:37.430> I'll

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
we're gonna do and sometimes here I'll

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.970 
we're gonna do and sometimes here I'll
often<00:02:38.180> lean<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> sewing-machine<00:02:38.810> back<00:02:39.380> this

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
often lean the sewing-machine back this

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.920 
often lean the sewing-machine back this
little<00:02:40.190> point<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:41.240> is<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.480> part<00:02:41.750> that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
little point this is the part that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230 
little point this is the part that
actually<00:02:41.960> comes<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.620> gets<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.100> thread<00:02:43.940> off

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
actually comes in gets the thread off

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.970 
actually comes in gets the thread off
the<00:02:44.510> needle<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.110> sometimes<00:02:45.470> what<00:02:45.560> I'll<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.830> is

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the needle and sometimes what I'll do is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.560 
the needle and sometimes what I'll do is
after<00:02:46.430> I've<00:02:46.670> cleaned<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.090> part<00:02:47.330> too<00:02:47.480> if

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
after I've cleaned this part too if

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.150 
after I've cleaned this part too if
there's<00:02:47.720> any<00:02:47.870> extra<00:02:48.230> lint<00:02:48.410> hanging<00:02:48.710> out<00:02:48.860> I'll

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
there's any extra lint hanging out I'll

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.430 
there's any extra lint hanging out I'll
even<00:02:49.400> feel<00:02:49.820> this<00:02:50.060> with<00:02:50.240> my<00:02:50.420> finger<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.050> make

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
even feel this with my finger and make

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.320 
even feel this with my finger and make
sure<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.770> there's<00:02:51.980> not<00:02:52.130> any<00:02:52.190> burrs<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:53.150> that

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
sure that there's not any burrs on that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.000 
sure that there's not any burrs on that
a<00:02:53.360> burr<00:02:53.690> would<00:02:53.870> happen<00:02:54.350> if<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:54.680> needle

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
a burr would happen if your needle

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.970 
a burr would happen if your needle
strikes<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.840> leaves<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.990> little<00:02:57.140> rough

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
strikes it and leaves a little rough

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.680 
strikes it and leaves a little rough
spot<00:02:58.280> that's<00:02:58.790> something<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.300> you'd<00:02:59.450> want<00:02:59.480> to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
spot that's something that you'd want to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.010 
spot that's something that you'd want to

gonna<00:03:06.890> go<00:03:07.070> ahead<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.250> set<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.880> it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
gonna go ahead and set that in it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.750 
gonna go ahead and set that in it's
really<00:03:08.900> only<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.470> way<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.830> goes<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.580> does

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760

the needles not high enough the needle

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.150 
the needles not high enough the needle
threader<00:04:23.810> will<00:04:23.900> not<00:04:24.169> line<00:04:24.380> up<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:24.770> you'll

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
threader will not line up and you'll

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.600 
threader will not line up and you'll
know<00:04:25.340> before<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:26.000> start<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.419> sew<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.870> have

know before you start to sew and have

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.429 
know before you start to sew and have
additional<00:04:28.030> problem<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:28.750> that's<00:04:29.169> just<00:04:29.349> a

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
additional problem so that's just a

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.520 
additional problem so that's just a
little<00:04:29.620> extra<00:04:29.949> tip<00:04:30.280> there
