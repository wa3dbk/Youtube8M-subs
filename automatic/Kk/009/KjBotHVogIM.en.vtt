00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
such a big deal is it the amount of

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.640 
such a big deal is it the amount of
innovation<00:00:17.550> what's<00:00:18.180> making<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> really<00:00:19.109> push

forward to the front of the industries I

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.870 
forward to the front of the industries I
think<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.380> automotive<00:00:22.890> has<00:00:23.189> turned<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.609> very

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
think that automotive has turned a very

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.330 
think that automotive has turned a very
important<00:00:24.390> part<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> CES<00:00:25.260> meanwhile<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the reason why we have that amount of

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
the reason why we have that amount of
attractiveness<00:00:31.080> most<00:00:31.439> likely<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.009> we

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
attractiveness most likely is that we

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that my perception of the automotive

that my perception of the automotive
industry<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.590> very<00:02:34.800> fast<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.970> don't

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
industry is it is very fast so don't

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.880 
industry is it is very fast so don't

automotive industry and if you if you

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
see to the North all here in CES what's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.640 
see to the North all here in CES what's
ongoing<00:02:42.300> they're<00:02:42.750> most<00:02:42.959> likely<00:02:43.050> European

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
ongoing they're most likely European

ongoing they're most likely European
there<00:02:43.860> already<00:02:44.220> you'll<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> our

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
there already you'll see that our

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.660 
there already you'll see that our
customers<00:02:46.170> who<00:02:46.590> come<00:02:46.739> in<00:02:46.890> your<00:02:47.010> pictures<00:02:47.370> are

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
customers who come in your pictures are

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.960 
customers who come in your pictures are
very<00:02:47.910> fast<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.510> then<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.800> think<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.610> two

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
very fast and then I think that two

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420 
very fast and then I think that two
worlds<00:02:51.420> obviously<00:02:51.989> means<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
worlds obviously means the one is the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.070 
worlds obviously means the one is the
consumer<00:02:53.910> electronics<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.720> other<00:02:54.870> one

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
consumer electronics and the other one

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.449 
consumer electronics and the other one
is<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> automotive<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:55.950> call<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.250> red

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
is the automotive we call it the red

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.820 
is the automotive we call it the red
bird<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> blue<00:02:57.150> girl<00:02:57.390> right<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.260> it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
bird and the blue girl right now and it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.190 
bird and the blue girl right now and it
is<00:02:58.890> as<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.600> question<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:01.049> whether

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
is as it is and the question is whether

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990 
is as it is and the question is whether
we<00:03:01.320> want<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.799> an<00:03:01.980> important<00:03:02.400> part<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
we want to be an important part of that

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.660 
we want to be an important part of that
and<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.480> think<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.780> are<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.769> whether<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.489> want

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and we think we are or whether we want

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.910 
and we think we are or whether we want
it<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.910> can't<00:03:06.150> ignore<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it you can't ignore it you know and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.580 
it you can't ignore it you know and
connectivity<00:03:08.880> availability<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:10.110> data<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
connectivity availability of data and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.770 
connectivity availability of data and
music<00:03:11.040> information<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.090> on<00:03:12.239> it's

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
music information and so on it's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.570 
music information and so on it's
something<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.290> car<00:03:13.500> drivers<00:03:13.980> definitely

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
something that car drivers definitely

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.630 
something that car drivers definitely
request<00:03:15.180> us<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.660> deliver<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:17.250> are<00:03:17.370> part<00:03:17.580> of

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
request us to deliver so we are part of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.190 
request us to deliver so we are part of

automotive industry some of the perhaps
the<00:03:30.269> car<00:03:30.480> manufacturers<00:03:31.230> can't<00:03:31.829> do

the car manufacturers can't do

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.490 
the car manufacturers can't do
themselves<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.670> think<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:34.200> are<00:03:34.320> not<00:03:34.470> just

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.220 
themselves I think that we are not just
an<00:03:34.829> interface<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.489> are<00:03:35.640> part<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.970> both<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:37.110> are

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
an interface we are part of both we are

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.050 
an interface we are part of both we are
doing<00:03:37.410> both<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.190> red<00:03:38.370> world<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> blue

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
doing both the red world and the blue

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.680 
doing both the red world and the blue
book<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.570> that<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.470> not<00:03:41.190> at<00:03:41.340> least<00:03:41.549> one<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
book and that is not at least one of the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.420 
book and that is not at least one of the
reasons<00:03:43.019> my<00:03:43.110> boss<00:03:43.320> has<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> unique<00:03:43.890> position<00:03:44.100> in

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
reasons my boss has a unique position in

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.100 
reasons my boss has a unique position in
order<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.820> manage<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.209> interface<00:03:45.570> now<00:03:45.780> we<00:03:45.840> are

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
order to manage the interface now we are

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.199 
order to manage the interface now we are
at<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.709> interim<00:03:47.040> interface<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.850> manage

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
at the interim interface that you manage

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.370 
at the interim interface that you manage
and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.760 
and
I<00:03:49.530> think<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:51.200> with<00:03:52.200> respect<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
I think that with respect to the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.270 
I think that with respect to the
technology<00:03:53.310> platform<00:03:54.020> it's<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.200> good<00:03:55.350> sharing

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
technology platform it's a good sharing

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.940 
technology platform it's a good sharing
of<00:03:56.430> task<00:03:56.730> suppliers<00:03:57.570> like<00:03:57.750> Bosch<00:03:58.050> for<00:03:58.410> example

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
of task suppliers like Bosch for example

also<00:05:32.250> for<00:05:33.140> functions<00:05:34.140> and

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249 
also for functions and

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.119 
also for functions and
basic<00:05:36.149> design<00:05:36.539> requirements<00:05:37.529> as<00:05:37.649> we<00:05:37.799> see<00:05:37.979> them

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
basic design requirements as we see them

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.169 
basic design requirements as we see them
in<00:05:38.279> emerging<00:05:38.879> markets<00:05:38.909> yeah<00:05:39.919> okay<00:05:40.919> AB<00:05:41.129> and<00:05:41.639> and

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:42.179 
in emerging markets yeah okay AB and and

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.149 
in emerging markets yeah okay AB and and
last<00:05:42.869> last<00:05:43.169> question<00:05:43.649> I<00:05:43.739> don't<00:05:43.799> know<00:05:43.979> if<00:05:44.069> it

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
last last question I don't know if it

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.569 
last last question I don't know if it
was<00:05:44.279> yourself<00:05:44.699> or<00:05:45.029> perhaps<00:05:45.359> they<00:05:45.829> the<00:05:46.829> rupa

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:47.579 
was yourself or perhaps they the rupa

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:49.369 
was yourself or perhaps they the rupa
from<00:05:47.759> out<00:05:47.909> either<00:05:48.119> in<00:05:48.479> their<00:05:48.749> keynote<00:05:49.109> talked

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
from out either in their keynote talked

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.259 
from out either in their keynote talked
about<00:05:49.589> german<00:05:50.219> engineering<00:05:50.639> meeting<00:05:50.969> with

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:51.269 
about german engineering meeting with

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.659 
about german engineering meeting with
silicon<00:05:51.749> valley<00:05:51.959> to<00:05:52.259> to<00:05:52.889> produce<00:05:53.219> these

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
silicon valley to to produce these

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.849 
silicon valley to to produce these
innovative<00:05:54.509> ideas<00:05:54.959> but<00:05:55.229> really<00:05:55.709> well

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:55.859 
innovative ideas but really well

00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:56.749 
innovative ideas but really well
engineered<00:05:56.339> and<00:05:56.489> you<00:05:56.549> talk<00:05:56.729> about

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
engineered and you talk about

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.119 
engineered and you talk about
engineering<00:05:57.359> reliability<00:05:58.229> do<00:05:58.829> you<00:05:58.919> think

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
engineering reliability do you think

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.489 
engineering reliability do you think
it's<00:05:59.309> a<00:05:59.549> coincidence<00:05:59.819> that<00:06:00.689> so<00:06:01.079> many<00:06:01.199> of<00:06:01.349> the

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:01.499 
it's a coincidence that so many of the

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.039 
it's a coincidence that so many of the
leaders<00:06:01.709> in<00:06:01.859> this<00:06:02.189> sector<00:06:02.459> are<00:06:03.049> german

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:04.049 
leaders in this sector are german

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:08.269 
leaders in this sector are german
companies<00:06:04.469> i<00:06:06.319> think<00:06:07.319> that<00:06:07.379> if<00:06:07.919> you<00:06:08.069> talk<00:06:08.249> about

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
companies i think that if you talk about

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.149 
companies i think that if you talk about
automotive<00:06:08.849> industry<00:06:09.889> germany<00:06:10.889> is<00:06:10.949> the

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
automotive industry germany is the

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.579 
automotive industry germany is the
birthplace<00:06:11.339> of<00:06:11.610> the<00:06:12.569> old<00:06:12.839> emotive<00:06:13.199> industry

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
birthplace of the old emotive industry

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.519 
birthplace of the old emotive industry
basically<00:06:13.769> so<00:06:14.509> we<00:06:15.509> had<00:06:15.629> to<00:06:15.779> nose<00:06:15.959> ahead<00:06:16.169> so<00:06:16.469> to

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
basically so we had to nose ahead so to

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.059 
basically so we had to nose ahead so to
say<00:06:16.829> and<00:06:17.009> manage<00:06:17.999> fortunately<00:06:18.919> to<00:06:19.919> have<00:06:20.039> a

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
say and manage fortunately to have a

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.149 
say and manage fortunately to have a
strong<00:06:20.639> position<00:06:20.879> but<00:06:21.539> we<00:06:22.349> definitely<00:06:22.709> need

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
strong position but we definitely need

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.309 
strong position but we definitely need
also<00:06:23.399> to<00:06:23.549> look<00:06:23.819> at<00:06:23.969> what's<00:06:24.239> going<00:06:24.689> on<00:06:24.899> here<00:06:25.169> in

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
also to look at what's going on here in

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.979 
also to look at what's going on here in
the<00:06:25.409> US<00:06:25.729> is<00:06:26.729> a<00:06:26.789> very<00:06:27.089> strong<00:06:27.389> automotive

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:27.989 
the US is a very strong automotive

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:30.589 
the US is a very strong automotive
market<00:06:28.409> and<00:06:28.619> we<00:06:28.769> as<00:06:28.949> Bosh<00:06:29.249> to<00:06:29.549> consider<00:06:29.999> the

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
market and we as Bosh to consider the

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.719 
market and we as Bosh to consider the
u.s.<00:06:30.959> in<00:06:31.199> many<00:06:31.439> aspects<00:06:32.009> as<00:06:32.219> the<00:06:32.519> leading

u.s. in many aspects as the leading

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.729 
u.s. in many aspects as the leading
market<00:06:33.329> in<00:06:33.449> the<00:06:33.599> world<00:06:33.629> yeah<00:06:34.049> for<00:06:34.589> some

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:34.739 
market in the world yeah for some

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:38.779 
market in the world yeah for some
applications<00:06:34.939> and<00:06:36.289> although<00:06:37.429> the<00:06:38.429> question

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
applications and although the question

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.819 
applications and although the question
is<00:06:38.939> not<00:06:39.149> fully<00:06:39.569> answered<00:06:40.199> yet<00:06:40.439> or<00:06:40.649> the

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:40.829 
is not fully answered yet or the

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:43.609 
is not fully answered yet or the
decision<00:06:41.279> is<00:06:41.429> not<00:06:41.459> fully<00:06:42.049> pronounced<00:06:43.049> yet<00:06:43.289> I

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:43.619 
decision is not fully pronounced yet I

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.309 
decision is not fully pronounced yet I
think<00:06:44.549> that<00:06:44.819> especially<00:06:45.089> in<00:06:45.629> case<00:06:45.809> of<00:06:45.839> driver

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
think that especially in case of driver

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.859 
think that especially in case of driver
assistance<00:06:46.949> the<00:06:47.699> US<00:06:48.059> market<00:06:48.389> will<00:06:48.659> play<00:06:48.839> a

00:06:48.859 --> 00:06:48.869 
assistance the US market will play a

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.339 
assistance the US market will play a
very<00:06:49.289> important<00:06:49.889> role<00:06:49.949> and<00:06:50.989> this<00:06:51.989> is<00:06:52.139> what

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
very important role and this is what

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.219 
very important role and this is what
what<00:06:52.709> we<00:06:53.339> have<00:06:53.549> identified<00:06:53.849> and<00:06:54.689> understood

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
what we have identified and understood

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.119 
what we have identified and understood
very<00:06:55.499> early<00:06:55.949> so<00:06:56.879> we<00:06:57.539> are<00:06:57.749> since<00:06:58.259> years<00:06:58.709> in<00:06:58.919> palo
