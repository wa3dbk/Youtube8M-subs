 For the shopping mall knows that's it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.880

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 store slept 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 I did go through the night 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.900
 because I annoys me yesterday on animal 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.300
 that's an iphone 5 did not get 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.560
 I had only the photos on me 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.849
 watch me on the screen all the time 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.600
 Seen the goods photographed by 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.270
 but the official press photos we are 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.920
 but that's ok, that's cool 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.390
 I would like to box you the iphone 5 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.610
 and just compare it to that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.600

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.550

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.480
 and yes that would just once from the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.829
 compare size 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.629
 and I would say we unpack that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.320
 you will see that from the back now 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.480
 filmed this unboxing and with it 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.869
 Just a better look we pack 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.470
 the whole time is out my cat 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.470
 also on the way again 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.130
 that is now the 16 gb variant 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 I am such a case calms the apple 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.630
 fan and I hope I have no scratches 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.130
 disconnect i hope you i hope that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.130
 my iphone 5 is all right 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.320
 I am so happy I have that first time 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:56.340
 my god is easy so i pack 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.960
 It looks to me now it is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 very thin 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:08.390
 look if I scratch somewhere but yes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.390
 I have a dent in the frame 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 fact i do not know i have one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.760
 delle as part I hope it can be 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:23.610
 recognize and the delle is there in the frame 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.050
 It looks up there where my finger 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.050
 is just below that's not there 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.550
 fact is a scratch in the frame and 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:44.010
 I just unpacked it so I 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:46.340
 do not take it hard and here is still 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.340
 one 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.769
 there is still a scratch in the list 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.900
 room torn nigl brand new iphone and 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.090
 it is already damaged it is not 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.800
 impeccable so unfortunately I am too 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.709
 one of the candidates the scratches on 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.280
 frame does not matter now we do 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.799
 Now continue 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.980
 we compare the size so now 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.480
 is already a lot bigger and it is 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.780
 it has become thinner and it is damned 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:30.220
 slightly violent feels really good 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.000
 So I 'm going to do the first start 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.769
 but it is already a bit 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.480
 I am a bit disappointed but me 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.040
 I already read on the internet that completely 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 I have a lot of scratches and I'm annoyed 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.269
 just a little bit that way for that 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.250
 a lot of money what you actually paid 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.910
 for that then damaged goods 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.930
 Apple gets that shit though 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.530
 Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the iPhone 5 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.170
 but I will still 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.160
 complain because when I get new 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.079
 I would probably like to have 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.370
 have scratch in there so I want one 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:02.930
 new device iphone and configure now 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.100
 I'm the glorious no sim card so 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.500
 that has to do everything now 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.160
 that was such an unboxing i pack it now 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.170
 again to the side and we are still watching 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.780
 something is still new headphones 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.349
 I think times really good power plug 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.720
 as well as the new charging cable that has now 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.160
 you get such a small plug 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.500
 So is a completely new connection 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.310
 at the iphone 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.810
 then of course we have here 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.000
 of course the stickers 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.280
 user manual everything that has to be done 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.919
 I think I do not show 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.830
 and I want to show you something 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.479
 is still different and although apple has now 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.310
 the headphone jack is no longer on top 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.340
 there is nothing left now but only 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.410
 still the button to the screen lock 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.910
 loud and quiet on the side and the 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.770
 mute switch and below comes now 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.750
 headphone cable or plug and the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 is now the connection of the new from 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.220
 apple 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.870
 yes I will get that to my colleague 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.090

 you get there yes that was now 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.100
 so my first impression 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.450
 so it's damn easy one has 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.730
 not the feeling of being live online 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.860
 although it is taller it is nice and thin 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.930
 and it is well in the hand you come 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.940
 everywhere with a thumb that's me 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.080
 important that I once with the thumb 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.970
 can serve everything 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.350
 cool, I am curious, above all, I am 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.930
 curious as apple that solves the thing 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.400
 is damaged and I'll go now 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.480
