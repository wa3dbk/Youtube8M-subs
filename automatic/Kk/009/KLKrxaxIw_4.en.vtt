00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
but if you're playing a passive player

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
but if you're playing a passive player
with<00:01:50.460> an<00:01:50.580> OP<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:51.060> would<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.330> aware<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
with an OP they would be aware in the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
with an OP they would be aware in the
sky<00:01:52.170> ridge<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.400> if<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.939> accommodate

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
sky ridge here so if you accommodate

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
sky ridge here so if you accommodate
like<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.290> said<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.650> second<00:01:56.070> rule<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.250> coming

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
like I said on the second rule of coming

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.910 
like I said on the second rule of coming
at<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.180> squeaky<00:01:57.420> door<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.470> try<00:01:58.680> your

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
at a squeaky door you would try your

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
at a squeaky door you would try your
best<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> try<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.670> get<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.659> area<00:02:00.930> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
best to try and get out of this area you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
best to try and get out of this area you
don't<00:02:01.619> really<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> face<00:02:02.420> against<00:02:03.420> an

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
don't really want to face against an

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.570 
don't really want to face against an
opera<00:02:03.720> that's<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:04.020> long<00:02:04.200> range<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
opera that's got long range with you and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.100 
opera that's got long range with you and
you've<00:02:05.670> got<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:05.880> ear<00:02:06.000> case<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.869> you're

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you've got an ear case so if you're

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.800 
you've got an ear case so if you're
going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> hop<00:02:07.470> through<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.830> door<00:02:08.149> if<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
going to hop through that door if you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.999 
going to hop through that door if you
know<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> fact<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> be

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
know for a fact that is going to be

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.830 
know for a fact that is going to be
playing<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.610> there<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.000> long<00:02:12.150> range<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
playing out there at long range that is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.630 
playing out there at long range that is
good<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.320> hop<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.739> door<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.519> if

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
good you can hop for the door but if

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.250 
good you can hop for the door but if
you're<00:02:14.820> jumping<00:02:15.030> around<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:15.870> teammate

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
you're jumping around and your teammate

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020 
you're jumping around and your teammate
does<00:02:16.440> not<00:02:16.620> make<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.980> kill<00:02:17.190> off<00:02:17.310> there<00:02:17.519> then

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
does not make that kill off there then

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.370 
does not make that kill off there then
that's<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.480> leave<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.810> totally

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's going to leave you totally

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.720 
that's going to leave you totally
vulnerable<00:02:19.500> because<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.010> can't<00:02:20.250> shoot<00:02:20.489> very

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
vulnerable because you can't shoot very

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910 
vulnerable because you can't shoot very
accurate<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.209> wireless<00:02:21.630> jumping<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.350> if

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
accurate with wireless jumping so if

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.069 
accurate with wireless jumping so if
there's<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.850> can<00:02:24.209> rehearse<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
there's up I can rehearse out on the

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.539 
there's up I can rehearse out on the
site<00:02:25.290> here<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:26.100> there's<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.519> there

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
site here or if there's one up there

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.420 
site here or if there's one up there
then<00:02:27.440> you're<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.709> die<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.070> jump<00:02:29.310> in

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
then you're going to die if you jump in

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
then you're going to die if you jump in
a<00:02:29.489> bit<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.440> try<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.770> get

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
a bit so you just have to try and get

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.290 
a bit so you just have to try and get
out<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.069> door<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.310> fast<00:02:32.550> as<00:02:32.700> possible<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.150> can

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
out the door as fast as possible you can

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.130 
out the door as fast as possible you can
maybe<00:02:33.420> jump<00:02:33.750> once

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
maybe jump once

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.229 
maybe jump once
brend<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.099> corner<00:02:35.459> but

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
brend the corner but

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.750 
brend the corner but
if<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:37.099> even<00:02:38.099> if<00:02:38.189> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.370> get<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.489> smoke

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
if you can even if you can get a smoke

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
if you can even if you can get a smoke
grade<00:02:38.939> off<00:02:39.120> as<00:02:39.299> soon<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.629> possible<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.370> that's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
grade off as soon as possible and that's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.020 
grade off as soon as possible and that's
perfect

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
perfect

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.970 
perfect
what<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.719> lot<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.959> teams<00:02:43.230> doing<00:02:43.439> what<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.920> is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
what a lot of teams doing what we do is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.160 
what a lot of teams doing what we do is
our<00:02:44.159> strategy<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.269> actually<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
our strategy you can actually like you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.690 
our strategy you can actually like you
know<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.769> grenade<00:02:47.069> out<00:02:47.189> of<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.400> door<00:02:47.670> so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
know you can grenade out of the door so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.849 
know you can grenade out of the door so
you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.569> have<00:02:48.810> one<00:02:49.049> guy<00:02:49.230> sitting<00:02:49.560> back<00:02:49.829> here

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
you can have one guy sitting back here

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.220 
you can have one guy sitting back here
and<00:02:50.340> chucking<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:51.000> grid<00:02:51.480> off<00:02:51.689> that<00:02:51.900> door<00:02:52.079> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
and chucking a grid off that door and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.589 
and chucking a grid off that door and
born<00:02:52.439> up<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.889> then<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:53.939> chuck<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> smoke<00:02:54.450> we

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
born up and then if you chuck a smoke we

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.899 
born up and then if you chuck a smoke we
just<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.200> gap<00:02:55.439> there<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:56.459> should<00:02:56.700> run

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
just do that gap there that should run

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.539 
just do that gap there that should run
perfectly<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.989> mini<00:02:58.260> area<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.400> can

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
perfectly in this mini area so you can

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.069 
perfectly in this mini area so you can
smoke<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.939> off<00:03:00.030> before<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.659> guys<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.019> you

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
smoke it off before you guys are you

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.280 
smoke it off before you guys are you
great<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:02.099> if<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.969> can<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:03.900> set<00:03:04.170> up

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
great so if you can if you can set up

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.740 
great so if you can if you can set up
strategies<00:03:04.769> before<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.579> get<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.150> don't<00:03:06.450> LT

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
strategies before and get that don't LT

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.809 
strategies before and get that don't LT
you<00:03:06.900> can't<00:03:07.049> aim<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.409> perfectly<00:03:07.799> so<00:03:08.069> as<00:03:08.579> soon<00:03:08.760> as

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
you can't aim it perfectly so as soon as

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.159 
you can't aim it perfectly so as soon as
that<00:03:09.000> green<00:03:09.239> goes<00:03:09.450> off<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.750> doors<00:03:09.959> going<00:03:10.109> to

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
that green goes off the doors going to

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.659 
that green goes off the doors going to
be<00:03:10.260> open<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.620> left<00:03:10.889> half<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.220> second<00:03:11.579> after

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
be open then left half a second after

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.369 
be open then left half a second after
that<00:03:11.819> smoking<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.359> going<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.569> be<00:03:12.629> done<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.349> you

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
that smoking is going to be done so you

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.990 
that smoking is going to be done so you
recovered<00:03:13.829> completely<00:03:13.950> from<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.639> year<00:03:14.730> and

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
it's really easy to get the first couple

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.279 
it's really easy to get the first couple
of<00:05:32.129> kills<00:05:32.339> and<00:05:32.580> then<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.759> can<00:05:32.909> just<00:05:33.059> fall<00:05:33.240> back

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
of kills and then you can just fall back

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.689 
of kills and then you can just fall back
and<00:05:34.289> once<00:05:34.469> you've<00:05:34.649> fallen<00:05:34.770> back<00:05:35.039> you<00:05:35.279> you<00:05:35.580> know

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
and once you've fallen back you you know

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.920 
and once you've fallen back you you know
you've<00:05:35.879> got<00:05:36.029> the<00:05:36.120> advantage<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:36.539> don't<00:05:36.809> have

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
you've got the advantage you don't have

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.320 
you've got the advantage you don't have
to<00:05:37.050> push<00:05:37.229> anymore<00:05:37.499> and<00:05:37.800> then<00:05:38.759> you'll<00:05:39.149> have

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
to push anymore and then you'll have

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.969 
to push anymore and then you'll have
your<00:05:39.599> fifth<00:05:39.990> member<00:05:40.349> just<00:05:40.589> holding<00:05:40.889> this

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
your fifth member just holding this

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.529 
your fifth member just holding this
outside<00:05:41.339> area<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.819> they<00:05:41.909> can't<00:05:42.120> flank<00:05:42.419> you

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
outside area so they can't flank you

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.360 
outside area so they can't flank you
behind<00:05:42.749> again<00:05:43.110> because<00:05:43.709> that's<00:05:43.919> one<00:05:44.189> area

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
behind again because that's one area

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.010 
behind again because that's one area
that<00:05:44.669> that's<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.029> floor<00:05:45.270> on<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.479> strat<00:05:45.719> so

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
that that's the floor on the strat so

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.629 
that that's the floor on the strat so
you<00:05:46.589> have<00:05:46.709> to<00:05:46.830> have<00:05:46.889> one<00:05:47.129> person<00:05:47.490> watching

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
you have to have one person watching

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.309 
you have to have one person watching
your<00:05:47.909> back<00:05:48.029> your<00:05:48.240> back<00:05:48.270> all<00:05:48.629> the<00:05:48.779> time<00:05:48.930> and

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
your back your back all the time and

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.689 
your back your back all the time and
once<00:05:49.740> you've<00:05:49.860> got<00:05:50.009> that<00:05:50.129> cover<00:05:50.339> but<00:05:50.580> it's

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
once you've got that cover but it's

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.369 
once you've got that cover but it's
pretty<00:05:50.879> easy<00:05:50.999> if<00:05:51.689> you<00:05:51.809> get<00:05:51.959> the<00:05:52.020> first<00:05:52.199> two

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
pretty easy if you get the first two

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.829 
pretty easy if you get the first two
kills<00:05:52.619> so<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.789> would<00:05:53.969> be<00:05:54.240> my<00:05:54.360> advice<00:05:54.629> if<00:05:54.779> you

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
kills so that would be my advice if you

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.089 
kills so that would be my advice if you
want<00:05:54.959> to<00:05:55.020> do<00:05:55.110> a<00:05:55.139> guess<00:05:55.409> and<00:05:55.559> friends<00:05:55.860> do

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
want to do a guess and friends do

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.809 
want to do a guess and friends do
something<00:05:56.459> like<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.789> it's<00:05:57.360> really<00:05:57.689> good
