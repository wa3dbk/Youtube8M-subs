I wanted to alter a notebook that I was

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
I wanted to alter a notebook that I was
sent<00:00:31.260> by<00:00:31.439> faith<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.250> Christmas<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
sent by faith for Christmas and so I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
sent by faith for Christmas and so I
used<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.649> her<00:00:34.950> flowers<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
used one of her flowers on that and I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.190 
used one of her flowers on that and I
really<00:00:36.630> love<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.410> turned<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
really love the way it's turned out and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.619 
really love the way it's turned out and
I<00:00:40.200> didn't<00:00:40.860> need<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> die<00:00:41.340> cut<00:00:41.700> or<00:00:41.879> anything<00:00:42.000> for

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
I didn't need a die cut or anything for

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.389 
I didn't need a die cut or anything for
that<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:43.260> which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> great<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that because which is great because I

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
that because which is great because I
don't<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.649> flower

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
don't have one but that's the flower

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
don't have one but that's the flower
that<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.789> made<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> made<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.500> it's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that I made and I made it out of it's

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.660 
that I made and I made it out of it's
like<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> Velveteen<00:00:51.500> fabric<00:00:52.500> which<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
like a Velveteen fabric which is this

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
like a Velveteen fabric which is this
and<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> worked<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:55.980> well

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and I I think it worked really well

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680 
and I I think it worked really well
because<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.789> how<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.059> one's<00:00:57.210> killed<00:00:57.480> all

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
because see how that one's killed all

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.310 
because see how that one's killed all
you<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.690> give<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
you have to do is like you just give it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.240 
you have to do is like you just give it
a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.559> pull<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.160> they<00:01:02.399> automatically<00:01:04.250> add

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
a little pull and they automatically add

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.780 
a little pull and they automatically add
a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.770> curl<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> end<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a little bit of curl to the end of the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
a little bit of curl to the end of the
flowers<00:01:09.390> instead<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.530> staying<00:01:10.890> straight<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
flowers instead of staying straight so I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.859 
flowers instead of staying straight so I
think<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.979> turned<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.700> quite<00:01:14.970> well<00:01:15.420> it's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
think it turned out quite well it's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
think it turned out quite well it's
probably<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.619> perfect<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.060> first

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
probably not perfect but for my first

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080 
probably not perfect but for my first
one<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.470> nice<00:01:20.000> I've<00:01:21.000> just

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
one I think it's really nice I've just

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
one I think it's really nice I've just
put<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> lace<00:01:21.930> underneath<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
put a bit of lace underneath here but of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.890 
put a bit of lace underneath here but of
jute<00:01:24.380> I've<00:01:25.380> covered<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.900> dictionary

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
jute I've covered it with the dictionary

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
jute I've covered it with the dictionary
paper<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.920> some<00:01:29.100> white<00:01:29.340> tissue

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
paper and then just some white tissue

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.630 
paper and then just some white tissue
paper<00:01:30.439> over<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> top<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.250> add<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> little

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
paper over the top just to add a little

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
paper over the top just to add a little
bit<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> texture<00:01:33.570> too<00:01:33.960> much<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
bit of texture too much and that's a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.819 
bit of texture too much and that's a
simple<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:37.430> notebook<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
simple little notebook so that's that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.870 
simple little notebook so that's that
one<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.729> other<00:01:41.759> flower<00:01:43.130> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
one and the other flower is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
one and the other flower is
this<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.039> think<00:01:47.310> she<00:01:47.610> actually

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
this one here and I think she actually

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
this one here and I think she actually
got<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.479> method<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.259> trisha<00:01:49.770> who's<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
got this method from trisha who's a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.710 
got this method from trisha who's a
little<00:01:50.610> shabby<00:01:51.000> chic<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> I've<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.720> layered

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little shabby chic and I've just layered

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
little shabby chic and I've just layered
that<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> used<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> same<00:01:55.740> Velveteen

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that but I used the same Velveteen

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.810 
that but I used the same Velveteen
fabric<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.479> once<00:01:58.470> again<00:01:58.679> it's<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.220> perfect

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
fabric and once again it's not perfect

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
fabric and once again it's not perfect
but<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.969> really<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.170> gives<00:02:01.409> it's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
but I really like the look it gives it's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.419 
but I really like the look it gives it's
nice<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> shiny<00:02:02.899> just<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.250> doily<00:02:05.250> off
