00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.959
 testicles look for what 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.539
 Our coverage is to have a zone 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.570
 cuticle lay exactly so that we had 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.119
 side rollers are clean except for us 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 need red enamel and varnish to us 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.500
 will need more 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 acetone nail remover eva 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.079
 clean acetone will need a brush column 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 exactly the columns are not protein not some 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.629
 another because here is very elastic and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.710
 smooth juice with a thin thin nose 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.809
 to clean the cuticle and side we start 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.990
 with the fact that we cover the nails base 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.900
 such a bud georgia yes it is competitive 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.100
 cover but when you know him already 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.100
 no other benefit 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.680
 cover the base 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.860
 maximum butt with cuticle and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.700
 fully retractable side roller 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.700
 cover the entire nail 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:23.690
 if behind the heat and then numb 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.830
 we take to wet her procedures slightly 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.460
 we remove about a napkin and with a brush 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.020
 no fingernail proofreader nor all the more 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.790
 Q-tip 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.500
 ear has not wiped anything near 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.360
 napkin in order to be able to 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:50.560
 constantly wipe the brush brush checks 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.960
 fist and not tearing the brush 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.030
 cover the sides of the museum I have to be weak 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.620
 your soup is slowly drying not necessarily 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.150
 collect 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.150
 tassel corner lacquer 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:19.670
 and close completely matt now we 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:22.220
 we close it completely and give it to him 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:28.700
 the ability to dry is not a little bit not 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:32.300
 enough on the side for the work of the salon 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.850
 work you can not close the side 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.340
 especially if even wide to 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.530
 deliver form 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.190
 allowed this must necessarily be 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.030
 completely covered side to the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.780
 lower and in the first layer we cover 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.970
 nail end with a semi-dry brush 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:59.650
 almost wiped it and pour it and paint it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:04.360
 such with touching movements 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:08.840
 preferably not the tip butt of the hand 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.959
 apply varnish in this case you never 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.630
 the lacquer will not flow into the inner part of the bay 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.019
 if we cover competitive french y 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.470
 us on white is very clearly visible that we 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.470
 we have 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:36.250
 if I ottyanu cuticle visible so do not 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:41.060
 ideally exactly covered there is something here 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:45.230
 such here are the waves now I'm after 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.590
 cover the second layer of the nail will show how 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.590
 it's all 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.750
 when we cover with the second layer and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.180
 recruit a larger drop and now 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.610
 the second layer we show color we already 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:08.290
 we can not paint over somewhere around the perimeter 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:14.150
 so as not to stain and spoil give 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.960
 locus no try so on a drop 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.960
 not to add 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:38.350
 there's already the neutrons butt no longer touch 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:41.290
 we need only one layer can not 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.620
 wait for the varnish to dry completely while you 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.870
 cover all 10 fingers first layer 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.040
 second layer you can already proceed to 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.040
 cleaning 1 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.070
 retract the cuticle 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.240
 remove here you can see removed from the brush 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.490
 we can see a pink droplet removed 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.350
 be sure to wipe the brush dry 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.540
 sprout fat liquid flies he 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.730
 improvisation don or just sat down 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.430
 it does not matter here has no great significance 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.590
 cuticle kitty precisely tassels she 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.590
 never leave any villi 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.850
 between valak and butakovoy clear 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.110
 cleaned the logistics logger necessarily 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.180
 wipe the brush after each 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.960
 touching the red 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:44.200
 because it will erode clean 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.200
 cleaned with retard 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:09.619
 if lacquer runs under the cuticle 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:09.619
 retract the cuticle and go with a brush 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:20.369
 stuff on ingenious man jumped like 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:23.249
 and all if we fall into the arch somewhere 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:26.509
 on the side bolsters 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.580
 we take and wipe that way 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.789
 somewhere if here is leaking can so 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:36.209
 here's the way we clean up everything 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:39.059
 ideal red lacquer coating by any 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:41.249
 dark varnish any bright varnish nothing 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:43.699
 additionally there is no need to purchase 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.809
 acetone cup napkin 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.009
 which you only serve for 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:49.009
