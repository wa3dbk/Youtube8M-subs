00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
for such a big figure he has a really

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.430 
for such a big figure he has a really
nice<00:00:59.010> amount<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.399> articulation<00:01:00.230> his<00:01:01.230> head

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
nice amount of articulation his head

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
nice amount of articulation his head
does<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.829> move<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:02.910> wish<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
are on these hinges that allow it to go

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
are on these hinges that allow it to go
up<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> make<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.520> he<00:01:08.640> could<00:01:08.790> bring<00:01:08.909> his<00:01:09.060> arm

all<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.710> his<00:01:10.710> shoulder<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> ball

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
all the way up his shoulder is a ball

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.730 
all the way up his shoulder is a ball
joint<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.090> he<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.110> upper<00:01:13.590> bicep<00:01:14.400> schools

he has single jointed elbows and his

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.420 
he has single jointed elbows and his
elbow<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> swivel<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> he<00:01:23.310> could

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
elbow also has a swivel so he could

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.179 
elbow also has a swivel so he could
bring<00:01:23.549> him<00:01:23.670> back<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.970> forth<00:01:24.560> his<00:01:25.560> wrist<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

a ball-joint

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.640 
a ball-joint
so<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> lot<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> nice<00:01:28.380> movement

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
so you could get a lot of nice movement

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
so you could get a lot of nice movement
out<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:30.170> he<00:01:31.170> has<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.470> torso<00:01:31.860> joint<00:01:32.299> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
out of that he has the torso joint that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.670 
out of that he has the torso joint that
allows<00:01:33.360> him<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:34.020> side<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> side

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
allows him to go side to side

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.570 
allows him to go side to side
and<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.200> forward

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.890 

and<00:01:41.670> also<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:43.080> back<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.600> can't

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
and also a little bit back so you can't

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.420 
and also a little bit back so you can't
get<00:01:46.020> too<00:01:46.230> much<00:01:46.440> movement<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:47.010> of<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> joint

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
get too much movement out of that joint

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.880 
get too much movement out of that joint
but<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.540> such<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> big<00:01:48.960> figure<00:01:49.230> it<00:01:49.560> gets<00:01:49.800> a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but for such a big figure it gets a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.460 
but for such a big figure it gets a
decent<00:01:50.280> amount<00:01:50.690> his<00:01:51.690> hips<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.230> ball

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
decent amount his hips are on ball

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.110 
decent amount his hips are on ball
joints<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> allows<00:01:53.370> his<00:01:53.610> legs<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> come

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
joints and it allows his legs to come

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.680 
joints and it allows his legs to come
all<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.390> way<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.510> like<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.540> also

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
all the way up like this and it also

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.720 
all the way up like this and it also
allows<00:01:58.080> his<00:01:58.290> legs<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.620> come<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.160> little<00:01:59.580> bit

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
allows his legs to come out a little bit

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.280 
allows his legs to come out a little bit
but<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.000> weight<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.180> his<00:02:00.420> leg<00:02:00.600> brings<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.200> down

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
but the weight of his leg brings it down

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.940 
but the weight of his leg brings it down
right<00:02:01.560> away

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
right away

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.090 
right away
he<00:02:02.280> has<00:02:02.400> upper<00:02:02.760> thigh<00:02:02.970> swivels<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.100> single

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
he has upper thigh swivels and single

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.380 
he has upper thigh swivels and single
jointed<00:02:05.490> knees<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:07.490> his<00:02:08.490> knees<00:02:08.790> also<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
jointed knees and his knees also have a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.420 
jointed knees and his knees also have a
swivel

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.370 

he<00:02:14.430> has<00:02:14.550> ankle<00:02:14.940> pivots<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> ball

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
he has ankle pivots that are on a ball

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.470 
he has ankle pivots that are on a ball
so<00:02:16.860> they<00:02:17.460> go<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:17.970> down<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.970> turn<00:02:21.240> all

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so they go up and down and they turn all

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.330 
so they go up and down and they turn all
the<00:02:21.570> way<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> side<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.350> that's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the way to the side like this and that's

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.460 
the way to the side like this and that's
about<00:02:26.490> all<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.880> articulation<00:02:27.510> he<00:02:27.600> has<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
about all the articulation he has and I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.320 
about all the articulation he has and I
think<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.370> good<00:02:29.520> amount<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:29.910> such<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> big

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
think it's a good amount for such a big

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.580 
think it's a good amount for such a big
figure<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> don't<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.380> need<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
figure I don't think you really need a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.140 
figure I don't think you really need a
double<00:02:31.920> jointed<00:02:32.160> knees<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.580> elbows

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
double jointed knees or elbows

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.120 
double jointed knees or elbows
I<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.690> wish<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.080> his<00:02:34.350> head<00:02:34.530> went<00:02:34.740> back<00:02:34.800> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
I do wish that his head went back and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.340 
I do wish that his head went back and
forth<00:02:35.340> or<00:02:35.550> had<00:02:35.700> some<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.240> movement<00:02:36.450> kind

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
forth or had some kind of movement kind

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.720 
forth or had some kind of movement kind
of<00:02:37.410> sucks<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.100> stuck<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.490> that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
of sucks that it just stuck like that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.140 
of sucks that it just stuck like that
but<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> big<00:02:40.110> deal<00:02:40.790> now<00:02:41.790> let's<00:02:42.060> look

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
but it's not a big deal now let's look

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.590 
but it's not a big deal now let's look
at<00:02:42.209> some<00:02:42.540> comparisons<00:02:44.000> here<00:02:45.000> he<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.209> next<00:02:45.480> to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
at some comparisons here he is next to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.479 
at some comparisons here he is next to
the<00:02:45.720> age<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:46.050> Ultron<00:02:46.200> Marvel<00:02:46.620> select<00:02:47.070> Hulk<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
the age of Ultron Marvel select Hulk and

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.729 
the age of Ultron Marvel select Hulk and
as<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.570> Hulk<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> lot<00:02:49.410> bigger<00:02:49.590> than

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
as you can see Hulk is a lot bigger than

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.420 
as you can see Hulk is a lot bigger than
Iron<00:02:50.070> Man<00:02:51.410> which<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.560> too<00:02:52.709> bad<00:02:52.860> because<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.220> feel

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
Iron Man which is too bad because I feel

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.220 
Iron Man which is too bad because I feel
like<00:02:53.459> Hulk<00:02:53.820> Buster<00:02:54.150> Iron<00:02:54.330> Man<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.050> tower

like Hulk Buster Iron Man kind of tower

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.530 
like Hulk Buster Iron Man kind of tower
over<00:02:55.680> Hulk<00:02:55.890> or<00:02:56.340> at<00:02:56.550> least<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> same<00:02:57.269> size

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
can see he fits in a lot better with him

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.350 
can see he fits in a lot better with him
which<00:03:04.980> kind<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.340> sucks<00:03:05.610> because<00:03:05.820> it's<00:03:06.180> cool

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
that he fits in with Marvel Legends but

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.790 
that he fits in with Marvel Legends but
it's<00:03:09.239> really<00:03:09.450> too<00:03:09.720> bad<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:09.989> he's<00:03:10.290> too<00:03:10.500> small

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
it's really too bad that he's too small

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.080 
it's really too bad that he's too small

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.630 
to fit in good with Marvel Select
figures<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:13.680> he<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.800> next<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.280> Marvel

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
Select Unleashed Hall and as you can see

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.920 
Select Unleashed Hall and as you can see
this<00:03:17.280> Hulk<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.239> lot<00:03:18.390> bigger<00:03:18.540> than<00:03:18.690> him

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
this Hulk is just a lot bigger than him

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.800 
this Hulk is just a lot bigger than him
and<00:03:19.790> all<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> Marvel<00:03:21.209> Select<00:03:21.330> Hulk's<00:03:21.750> are

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
and all the Marvel Select Hulk's are

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.660 
and all the Marvel Select Hulk's are
pretty<00:03:22.019> much<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> same<00:03:22.440> size<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.010> they're<00:03:23.250> all

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
pretty much the same size so they're all

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.670 
pretty much the same size so they're all
going<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:23.940> bigger<00:03:24.239> than<00:03:24.420> him<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.320> here<00:03:25.650> he

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
going to be bigger than him and here he

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.460 
going to be bigger than him and here he
is<00:03:25.860> next<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.280> whole<00:03:27.090> classic<00:03:27.630> smart<00:03:28.019> Hulk<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
is next to whole classic smart Hulk and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.770 
is next to whole classic smart Hulk and
I<00:03:29.370> think<00:03:29.580> he<00:03:29.670> looks<00:03:29.850> really<00:03:30.030> good<00:03:30.239> next<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> him

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
I think he looks really good next to him

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.830 
I think he looks really good next to him
so<00:03:31.050> his<00:03:31.680> size<00:03:31.920> isn't<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.610> deal<00:03:33.330> breaker<00:03:33.570> or

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
so his size isn't a deal breaker or

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.330 
so his size isn't a deal breaker or
anything<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.260> still<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> really<00:03:34.860> good<00:03:34.980> figure

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
anything is still a really good figure

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.800 
anything is still a really good figure
but<00:03:35.519> he's<00:03:35.610> probably<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:36.150> gonna<00:03:36.269> be<00:03:36.510> hanging

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
but he's probably just gonna be hanging

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.030 
but he's probably just gonna be hanging
out<00:03:36.870> with<00:03:36.930> Marvel<00:03:37.320> Legends<00:03:37.650> instead<00:03:37.920> of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
out with Marvel Legends instead of

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.880 
out with Marvel Legends instead of
Marvel's<00:03:38.340> legs<00:03:38.660> here<00:03:39.660> he<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.840> next<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.230> Bucky

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
Marvel's legs here he is next to Bucky
