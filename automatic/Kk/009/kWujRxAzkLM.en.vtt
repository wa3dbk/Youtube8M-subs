00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:02.917
 Do you have ads displaying the message "Suspended Site"? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.417
 To protect our users, we will not show ads 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.792
 who are not following AdWords policies. 

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.667
 But, if you fix the problem of your website, 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.792
 it may be displayed again. 

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.000
 So the first step is to find out why the site has been suspended. 

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.208
 And I'll show you how. 

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.166
 If your site has been suspended, you have received an email 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.333
 from adwords-noreply@google.com. 

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:33.208
 This email will tell you exactly why your site has been suspended 

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.667
 and it will have a link that directs exactly 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.208
 to the page that gives more details about this policy. 

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:41.792
 You can also add the "Policy Details" column to see, 

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.250
 within your account, what the reason for the suspended site. 

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:49.250
 Then you go to "Ads", then click on "Columns", 

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.166
 and "Customize Columns". 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.291
 It will appear on your right, the "Policy Details" option. 

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.583
 Just click "Add", scroll down a little 

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.667
 and click the blue button, "Apply." 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.375
 You will notice that it will appear here on your side 

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:06.083
 exactly the reason you were suspended. 

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.625
 And by clicking on this link, 

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:10.500
 you are directed to a page that gives you all the details. 

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:13.083
 Now that you have understood what policy you are violating, 

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.041
 you need to make site changes 

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.458
 to stop violating this policy. 

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:21.750
 As each policy is very specific, use the link you received by email 

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.458
 or that you took the account to make the correction. 

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.125
 Keep in mind that not all policy violations 

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:28.792
 can be repaired. 

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:32.041
 There are some sites that we really do not let be announced 

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.417
 for user protection. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.375
 So if your site is one of those 

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:38.500
 or you do not want to make the policy changes, 

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:40.667
 unfortunately your ad can not be displayed. 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.542
 Now, if you have already made the requested changes, 

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.208
 you can ask for a new review. 

00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.875
 Before sending for this new review, just make sure that, in fact, 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.583
 You corrected everything that was asked in politics. 

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.166
 Because when a website goes several times for review 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.041
 and it is suspended every time, 

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.750
 there is a risk that your account will be suspended, okay? 

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.208
 If the new review shows that all violations of your site 

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:05.166
 have been fixed, your site will be rehabilitated 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.333
 and your ads are approved again. 

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:11.417
 Remembering that the review process takes up to 3 business days 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.166
 and as soon as it is completed, you will be notified. 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.250
