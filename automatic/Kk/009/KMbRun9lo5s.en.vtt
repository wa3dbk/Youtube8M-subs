 attach and here's an adapter for 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.170
 all flash drives 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:09.830
 he is different such here and so adapter he 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:13.070
 even have a camera install it 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:22.310
 called adapter is only once in 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.370
 they are called cards they have it 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.490
 cards understood yes memory cards 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.470
 and these two adapters are not very similar 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.270
 only this one is not necessary here 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.880
 Now insert ect already built it here 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.100

 Here is an adapter which is now more 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.709
 one does not put a lot 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.769

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.080
 rope card everything and we expose 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.390
 computer now I have to show details 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.890
 how to embed it 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.690
 because some don't even know where 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.340
 adapters leave turned on the flash bye 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.390
 filmed before 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.390
 excuse me 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.659
 Here I have here is such a somehow 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.790
 understood here i click on me here 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.390
 turns on yes and here it is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.879
 here 2 there are such big things 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.530
 This is what I don't know. Even if you 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.629
 insert here it is inserted it is rain 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.889
 for adapters, it is still too small 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:41.760
 here it is here to be treated but here is the adapter 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:46.879
 this is now a very good right now gizmos 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.879
 turn on the computer to show you how 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.050
 how does the computer show that she 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:59.870
 It works that the doctor is in working condition 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.870
 here we turn on the mouse 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.280
 and here it is 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.060
 who show she lights up 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.260
 lights up if we enable adapt and the same 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.260
 most will 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 here 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.229
 that is convenient to learn at all from whom 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.570
 I think everyone has new ones 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.539
 processors the process is already called 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.680
 These are the things that are inserted 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:33.660
 they all have adapters on 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.340
 many more have been invented 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.539
 I know what they are for 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.940
 this is a micro well, that is, you cannot go wrong 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:49.180
 because nobody they 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:52.300
 some kind of general and do not insert this 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.280
 no avt it on visent appears where 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.280
 upwards then the posture process and 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 to throw 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.030
 no shut down 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.750
 here well in general here as here and so 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.599
 all these here wait for the next video 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.599
 There will of course be a vlog well until tomorrow 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:28.430
 and today you already have two videos here so 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.979
 That's all look at the other day I'll post as 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.830
 remove scratches 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.950
 drives 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.700
 because he is an ugly master 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.700
 scratches from now i'll show starobelsk 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.890
 here in the Urals 10 all scratches are 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.920
 only scratches that remain when 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:56.650
 swelling so here you see no scratches on it i 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.920
