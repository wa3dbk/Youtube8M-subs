 they are still from 4 to 20 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.690
 miles per hour in terms of 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.000
 cold air as we can see it feels 6

 that from 10 to 11 at night as 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.010
 a low pressure system reaches 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.440
 our area that means a system of 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.330
 low pressure good instability rain 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.010
 what are we going to have during the day Monday 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.290
 to start the work week and some 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.420
 snowflakes further north due to the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.330
 cold temperatures that we will have for 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.370

 the temperatures for Monday 46 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.510

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.450
 more and now I continue with you 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.060
 and speaking of the week of the day of san 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.830
 valentine, everything seems to reach us 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.390
 one of lime and another of steel 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.550
 temperatures increase what is good 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.380
 however the rain arrives for the day 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.760
 in the morning so good we're going to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.290
 take much less that we have 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.270
 good temperatures and the day of san 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.100
 valentine will be very cool so 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.990
 let's take this week sir 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.390
 today we reach a maximum of 36 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.490
 degrees we still stay below 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.530
 normal for this time we are seeing 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.570
 those temperatures at the regional level 46 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.580
 points for 43 in washington and 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.410
 precisely their digits in the 40 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.360
 degrees are what we're going to have 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.400
 here for tomorrow and the greatest 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.959
 part of this working week currently 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.480
 we have these temperatures in the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.940
 means 30 well up to 20 degrees like 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.220
 we see in white plains 25 degrees for 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.290
 this hour of the afternoon calm winds 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.120
 in most of our area a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.410
 little bit of winds of 3 miles 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.120
 hours and 6 miles per hour in what 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.650
 comes being the area of ​​things that 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.180
 is already happening and what is going 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.500
 to happen because temperatures are going to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.690
 increase good we have these 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.670
 winds that enter from the south what 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.440
 it means warm winds and that's why 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.150
 the temperatures will be maintained by 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.549
 above normal for the day 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.780
 the rest of the week at 40 degrees 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.280
 so let's take advantage of those 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.110
 temperatures that possibly reach 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.110
 up to 50 degrees as we see in the south 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.689
 yes 6 there are 52 47 for the city 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.239
 why please tomorrow's maximum 44 degrees 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.950
 clear conditions very sunny the 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.840
 today to end the end of 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.430
 week however this system quite 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.620
 great as you see coming from the area the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.480
 large lakes to the area then of the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.799
 gulf states will be moving towards 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.180
 our area and is the one that precisely 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.159
 will bring us that rain for tomorrow 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.109
 to start the week the cloudiness 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.970
 begins to increase tonight and the 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.319
 rain for time to go to work the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.180
 school is definitely going to be 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.470
 necessary to prepare as we are going to 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.060
 have stadiums visits on our 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.380
 life but it came late afternoon I 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.300
 I think the conditions start the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.220
 improvement already for hours at night in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.229
 conclusion tonight 34 degrees the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.419
 minimum cloudiness increases for the day 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.039
 in the morning it is a maximum of 47 degrees 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.990
 tomorrow night we see that 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.000
 mist temperature for tomorrow and tomorrow 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.710
 at night also and for the stop 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.180
 of the bus the little kids prepare it 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.639
 because it will be necessary to have the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.500
 umbrella for the next 45 days 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.660
 degrees the maximum of Tuesday 42 the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.160
 Wednesday and Valentine's Day 41 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.410
 degrees and the weekend 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.580
 we will tell you again with rain that 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.990
 everything is imparted in terms of time and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.990
 was worth now I continue with you
