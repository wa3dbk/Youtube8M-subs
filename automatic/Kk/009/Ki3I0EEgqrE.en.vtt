Garcia's<00:03:38.770> take<00:03:38.920> now<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> can<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:39.430> wrong<00:03:39.550> in

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
Garcia's take now so I can be wrong in

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.310 
Garcia's take now so I can be wrong in
his<00:03:39.820> ability<00:03:40.210> to<00:03:40.240> control<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.660> fight<00:03:40.870> he's<00:03:41.290> a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
his ability to control the fight he's a

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.770 
his ability to control the fight he's a
very<00:03:41.800> strong<00:03:42.070> fighter<00:03:48.270> cells<00:03:49.270> are<00:03:49.420> giving<00:03:49.690> up

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
very strong fighter cells are giving up

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.400 
very strong fighter cells are giving up
his<00:03:49.900> back<00:03:50.110> once<00:03:50.440> again<00:03:51.570> almost<00:03:52.570> four<00:03:53.140> minutes

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
his back once again almost four minutes

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.840 
his back once again almost four minutes
into<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.680> first<00:03:53.890> round<00:03:54.100> since<00:03:54.400> Salazar's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
into this first round since Salazar's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.820 
into this first round since Salazar's
got<00:03:55.000> about<00:03:55.210> a<00:03:55.270> minute<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:56.260> survive<00:03:56.650> this

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
got about a minute to to survive this

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.800 
got about a minute to to survive this
round<00:03:57.040> or<00:03:57.280> reverse<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:58.030> fortunes<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:58.570> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
round or reverse the fortunes that that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.570 
round or reverse the fortunes that that
so<00:03:59.050> far<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.290> think<00:03:59.590> we'd<00:03:59.740> see<00:03:59.920> Garcia<00:04:00.310> winning

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
so far I think we'd see Garcia winning

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.830 
so far I think we'd see Garcia winning
this<00:04:00.670> round<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:05.400> referee<00:04:06.400> Troy<00:04:06.610> wass<00:04:06.940> sorry
