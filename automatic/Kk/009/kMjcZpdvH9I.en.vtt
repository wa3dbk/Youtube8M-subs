and I am patents you moving so i decided
to<00:01:45.020> try<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.320> escape<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.560> left<00:01:45.860> hand<00:01:46.070> side<00:01:46.130> map

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
to try and escape the left hand side map

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.859 
to try and escape the left hand side map
I<00:01:46.580> can<00:01:46.700> see<00:01:46.820> what<00:01:46.909> conquerors<00:01:47.330> pushed<00:01:47.540> already

over here so I push my head though here

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.120 
over here so I push my head though here
just<00:01:51.110> see<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.409> can<00:01:51.500> spoil<00:01:51.740> anything<00:01:51.860> under

down<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.639> bit<00:05:49.879> to<00:05:49.909> try<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.270> just<00:05:50.449> watch<00:05:50.539> it

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
down a bit to try and just watch it

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.930 
down a bit to try and just watch it
actually<00:05:51.020> I've<00:05:51.409> been<00:05:52.099> fired<00:05:52.520> again<00:05:52.759> to<00:05:52.849> try

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
actually I've been fired again to try

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.409 
actually I've been fired again to try
and<00:05:53.090> hear<00:05:53.180> my<00:05:53.389> idea<00:05:53.719> of<00:05:53.750> her<00:05:53.870> hell<00:05:54.020> or<00:05:54.199> not<00:05:54.319> and

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
and hear my idea of her hell or not and

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.059 
and hear my idea of her hell or not and
that's<00:05:56.419> fine<00:05:56.599> I<00:05:56.840> see<00:05:57.349> a<00:05:57.379> van<00:05:57.620> will<00:05:57.889> freeze

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
that's fine I see a van will freeze

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.580 
that's fine I see a van will freeze
advancing<00:05:58.490> towards<00:05:58.819> base<00:05:59.229> and<00:06:00.229> I'm<00:06:00.380> starting

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
advancing towards base and I'm starting

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.379 
advancing towards base and I'm starting
to<00:06:00.680> think<00:06:00.770> we<00:06:00.919> call<00:06:01.130> after<00:06:01.400> them<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.639> i'm

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
to think we call after them and i'm

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.820 
to think we call after them and i'm
pretty<00:06:02.599> sure<00:06:02.750> as<00:06:02.960> I<00:06:02.990> turned<00:06:03.319> around<00:06:03.409> to<00:06:03.710> go

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
pretty sure as I turned around to go

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.019 
pretty sure as I turned around to go
after<00:06:03.979> them<00:06:04.870> he<00:06:05.870> gets<00:06:06.050> killed<00:06:07.000> although<00:06:08.000> I

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
after them he gets killed although I

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.850 
after them he gets killed although I
actually<00:06:08.539> stopped<00:06:08.900> engaging<00:06:09.080> s<00:06:09.440> if<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:09.710> want

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
actually stopped engaging s if you want

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.879 
actually stopped engaging s if you want
to<00:06:09.919> try<00:06:10.099> and<00:06:10.190> get<00:06:10.279> some<00:06:10.460> more<00:06:10.550> damage

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
to try and get some more damage

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.330 
to try and get some more damage
oh<00:06:16.379> yeah<00:06:17.379> I<00:06:17.409> was<00:06:17.560> great<00:06:17.680> we<00:06:17.770> can<00:06:17.889> get<00:06:18.009> a<00:06:18.039> second

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
oh yeah I was great we can get a second

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.260 
oh yeah I was great we can get a second
shot<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.550> finish<00:06:18.789> off<00:06:18.939> with<00:06:19.030> some<00:06:19.150> of<00:06:19.210> the

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
shot to finish off with some of the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.820 
shot to finish off with some of the
alternative<00:06:19.689> off<00:06:19.749> and<00:06:20.110> they<00:06:20.289> moved<00:06:20.529> from<00:06:20.650> m1

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
alternative off and they moved from m1

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.149 
alternative off and they moved from m1
or<00:06:20.979> 30<00:06:21.460> I<00:06:22.270> mean<00:06:22.449> somebody<00:06:22.719> kills<00:06:22.900> them<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:24.039> now
