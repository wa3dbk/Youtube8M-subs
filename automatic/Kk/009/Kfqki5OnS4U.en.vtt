00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
I was gonna make the Eagles and I even

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.969 
I was gonna make the Eagles and I even
thought<00:01:04.539> about<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.869> too<00:01:05.080> but<00:01:05.649> since<00:01:05.770> I'm

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
thought about that too but since I'm

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.410 
thought about that too but since I'm
doing<00:01:06.100> career<00:01:06.460> mode<00:01:06.670> with<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.940> Eagles<00:01:07.270> and

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
doing career mode with the Eagles and

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.999 
doing career mode with the Eagles and
I'm<00:01:07.479> always<00:01:07.659> doing<00:01:08.110> something<00:01:08.350> involving<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
I'm always doing something involving the

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.200 
I'm always doing something involving the
Eagles<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:09.399> figured<00:01:09.700> I'd<00:01:09.759> switch<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.090> up

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
Eagles I figured I'd switch it up

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.399 
Eagles I figured I'd switch it up
because<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.570> Dolphins<00:01:10.930> were<00:01:11.049> actually<00:01:11.320> my

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
because the Dolphins were actually my

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.320 
because the Dolphins were actually my
