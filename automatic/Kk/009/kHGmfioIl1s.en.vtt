00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.210
 Hello and welcome to the weekend weather on weather tile man 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.570
 Production Popkomm or on the youtube channel 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.080
 before a weekend on Saturday, especially right again 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.380
 summer is still on Sunday but still only in the eastern half 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.350
 Germany on Sunday in the west already denser clouds downpour and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429
 Thunderstorms will arrive relatively early 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.069
 the AR Drone solar sunshine forecast for Saturday shows 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.630
 on the one hand on this sheet a bit the sun shines on it 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.580
 and the hand casts a shadow Allam bit stupid 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.480
 yes I knew a bit so tilting is how it works 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870
 you can see in the north, it is also quite okay but a few denser 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.290
 Cloud fields stretch over the north, leaving most veils veiled 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.740
 that makes the sun in between a bit Mielich lies and reduces 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.890
 also the sunshine duration towards middle and south much sun on Saturday 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.460
 and with that much sunshine, they also see a lot of heat 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.130
 it is a bit more wet Klopsch air that comes in there evenings 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.130
 Ladies Ladies Saturday morning I concluded that also a few 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.530
 early fog fields in which Intel can be found mainly in the low mountain range 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.910
 are also in the river valleys otherwise decently going but instead 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.020
 little cloud of fog overall, no em-match the beginning for that 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.800
 Saturday the early fog fields are then quickly way what is left are just these 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.950
 Veil clouds and a bit of bids leeks in the far south to the north 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.490
 Veil clouds also sometimes just a bit thick as already seen 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 in the afternoon and evening will be less in the cloud of fog in the north then 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.110
 The sun comes through better and not excluded that is completely in the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.780
 South in the evening then and at night then anyway for the first 1 2 one 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 shy chill 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.800
 and thunderstorms soon details about 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.990
 at storm station Punkt de 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.430
 and the temperature can really be seen for summer love but only where 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.950
 the wind blows over the water for a long time so also in the southeast of Fehmarn 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.500
 Parts somehow must the northeast to eastern parts there is under 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420
 20 degrees the maximum temperatures 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 even Heligoland manages to reach 20 and otherwise 25 and up to 30 degrees 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.400
 So much of Germany with a summer break Saturday 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.879
 the wind can be a surprise from the southern directions that is floating 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.729
 then too 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.809
 as long as you win a bit stronger than the sea breeze 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.569
 in heat to the coasts and partly also to the East Frisian and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.429
 North Frisian islands heading south this rather the weak pound 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.039
 circulating game 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.939
 then looks at the Sunday you can see there is already the best the front 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.539
 arrived middle nothing and fun mixed 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.459
 at the action solar sunshine forecast 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.270
 further east, however, still a lot of sun 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.710
 and there the sun and the summer stops partly until Sunday evening by all 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.040
 Details then for the Sunday forecast when will the thunderstorms come, too 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.479
 in the East to others 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.360
 during the course of Saturday on this canal 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.980
 So it pays to check in for the last details and is
