00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.080
 hi there a few days ago 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.119
 one of my followers was asked 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.670
 the question of how at home 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.660
 using a minimum of tools you can 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 do carpentry and finger jointing 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.519
 more precisely how to make eyes because 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 Thorn can be made on the circular saw 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.110
 and with the help of a router 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.379
 I showed in one of his video here I 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 I want to show my simple 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.079
 adaptation which as usual 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.320
 was made for one job and serves 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.949
 for several years this device 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:59.340
 allows me to groove 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:05.070
 eyes of both open type and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.159
 closed with these eyes I can 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.760
 do both in the blood and the details and in the butt 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 parts for this part I attach 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.130
 upright I have here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.180
 come now i will deploy 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.180
 the device will show 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.310
 This is my stroke limiter 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.840
 which allows you to set along with here 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 this stop to set the width of the spike 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.180
 it fastens 1 clamp in order to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.180
 he did not slide here is filled with sandpaper and 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.910
 now the device itself is like that 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.500
 me organized mount 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.500
 details upright here 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:05.320
 sat he comes from metric spit and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.030
 at 6 which is wrapped in paradise for 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.850
 wood 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.100
 if i do the milling in the edge 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:20.560
 then this bar I unfold 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:27.850
 That's the way I have the detail 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.790
 It falls on it is convenient if done 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:38.230
 a series of parts then easier to put 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:43.810
 the size is exactly and from this side I have 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.780
 4 clogged nut 6 and bolt 2 to 8 all 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.209
 it is made of furniture chipboard 18 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.060
 millimeters 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.890
 twisted confirm atom and screws such 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.709
 quite primitive fixture 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.700
 nevertheless allows very strongly 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:07.540
 facilitate the work of choice and eyes for 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.150
 connections on this for today all all 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.209
