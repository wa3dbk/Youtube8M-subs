00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
to do is bring your color on to the

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.840 
to do is bring your color on to the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
left-hand side of the screen and put it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
left-hand side of the screen and put it
in<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.179> the<00:00:48.269> three<00:00:48.539> boxes<00:00:49.019> for<00:00:49.199> each<00:00:49.289> piece

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
in one of the three boxes for each piece

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.200 
in one of the three boxes for each piece
at<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> moment<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.429> can't<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:51.030> die

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
at the moment you can't actually die

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
at the moment you can't actually die
weapons<00:00:51.690> which<00:00:51.839> is<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.289> annoying<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
weapons which is kind of annoying but I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.319 
weapons which is kind of annoying but I
guess<00:00:53.159> they'll<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.489> adding<00:00:53.729> that<00:00:53.819> in<00:00:53.999> at<00:00:54.120> some

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
guess they'll be adding that in at some

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.149 
guess they'll be adding that in at some
point<00:00:54.600> soon<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.079> least<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.319> hope<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.589> because<00:00:55.979> it

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
point soon at least I hope so because it

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.529 
point soon at least I hope so because it
is<00:00:56.249> kind<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.519> pointless<00:00:56.819> dying<00:00:57.179> all<00:00:57.359> your

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is kind of pointless dying all your

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.939 
is kind of pointless dying all your
armor<00:00:57.809> without<00:00:57.899> having<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.409> weapons<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
armor without having the weapons to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.829 
armor without having the weapons to
match<00:00:59.129> anyway<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.179> die<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> same

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
match anyway if you want to die the same

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.750 
match anyway if you want to die the same
section<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.649> pieces<00:01:01.889> of<00:01:02.100> armor<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.519> go

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
section on all pieces of armor just go

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280 
section on all pieces of armor just go
to<00:01:02.819> die<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.420> you're<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.839> be<00:01:03.960> able<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to die or you're gonna be able to do

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
to die or you're gonna be able to do
that<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.339> also<00:01:05.519> clear<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.909> color

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that there you can also clear the color

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
that there you can also clear the color
in<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> certain<00:01:06.930> box<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.440> is<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> give

in a certain box which is going to give

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100 
in a certain box which is going to give
you<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> base<00:01:08.340> metal<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> also<00:01:09.720> copy

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you the base metal and you can also copy

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
challenges and this is really important

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
challenges and this is really important
most<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:50.580> achievements<00:01:51.240> were<00:01:51.330> already

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
most of these achievements were already

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
most of these achievements were already
there<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.900> guess<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:53.100> get

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there I guess but now you actually get

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.070 
there I guess but now you actually get
dies<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.820> them<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.660> need<00:01:54.870> to<00:01:54.960> do

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
dies from them and what you need to do

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.720 
dies from them and what you need to do
is<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.320> right-click<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.280> die<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
is just right-click on the die and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.130 
is just right-click on the die and
you're<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:56.970> see<00:01:57.150> exactly<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you're going to see exactly what you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
you're going to see exactly what you
need<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.680> unlock<00:01:58.980> it<00:01:59.160> some<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.520> these

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
need to do to unlock it some of these

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.430 
need to do to unlock it some of these
challenges<00:02:00.210> seem<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.510> be<00:02:00.630> bugged<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
see I've already got all of the racial

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.640 
see I've already got all of the racial
motifs<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.900> showing<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
one moving onto dye colors is actually a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.570 
one moving onto dye colors is actually a
huge<00:02:07.080> amount<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.409> choose<00:02:07.710> from<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.159> I'm<00:02:08.250> quite

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
huge amount to choose from and I'm quite

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
huge amount to choose from and I'm quite
impressed<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.209> greys<00:02:09.420> are<00:02:09.629> really<00:02:09.840> important

actually<00:02:17.550> look<00:02:17.670> different<00:02:18.090> depending<00:02:18.150> on

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
actually look different depending on

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.360 
actually look different depending on
where<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> put<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.350> your<00:02:19.530> setup<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.280> you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
where you put it in your setup so if you

put it in the middle
it's<00:02:21.170> actually<00:02:21.440> going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> look<00:02:21.800> different<00:02:21.980> to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's actually going to look different to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.710 
it's actually going to look different to
the<00:02:22.430> right<00:02:22.670> especially<00:02:23.150> with<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.390> set<00:02:23.630> of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the right especially with this set of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.210 
the right especially with this set of
armor<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.530> help<00:02:24.800> create<00:02:24.980> some

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
armor this can help create some

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.590 
armor this can help create some
different<00:02:25.640> textures<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.420> quite

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
different textures but it is quite

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120 
different textures but it is quite

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
all of your armor it means that you need

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.270 
all of your armor it means that you need

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
to mix and match sometimes with

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.830
