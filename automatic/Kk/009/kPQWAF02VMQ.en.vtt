00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
pc stick and they're basically ripoffs

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.420 
pc stick and they're basically ripoffs
of<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.230> wii<00:00:37.800> nunchuk<00:00:38.280> over<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.030> wii<00:00:39.150> console

of the wii nunchuk over the wii console

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.770 
of the wii nunchuk over the wii console
but<00:00:41.430> these<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.090> made<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:43.290> pc<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.160> i<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.910> use

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
but these are made for pc so i can use

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.850 
but these are made for pc so i can use
them<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.050> pc<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:48.500> they<00:00:49.500> come<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.280> USB

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
them for pc and they come with this USB

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.020 
them for pc and they come with this USB
receiver<00:00:53.240> so<00:00:54.240> i<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.510> control<00:00:54.900> a<00:00:55.140> watertight

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
receiver so i can control a watertight

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.010 
receiver so i can control a watertight
even<00:00:57.030> though<00:00:57.150> my<00:00:57.510> computer<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.520> bluetooth<00:01:00.020> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
even though my computer has bluetooth it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.130 
even though my computer has bluetooth it
still<00:01:01.350> needs<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.070> receiver<00:01:02.460> thing<00:01:03.050> one<00:01:04.050> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
still needs that receiver thing one of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
still needs that receiver thing one of
the<00:01:04.199> main<00:01:04.350> differences<00:01:04.920> between<00:01:05.810> these

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the main differences between these

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the main differences between these
things<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.030> an<00:01:09.030> actual<00:01:09.540> wien<00:01:09.869> remote<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
things and an actual wien remote that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.960 
things and an actual wien remote that
the<00:01:11.190> remote<00:01:11.580> has<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:12.270> infrared<00:01:12.540> camera<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
the remote has an infrared camera so

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
the remote has an infrared camera so
tracking<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:15.990> more<00:01:16.020> accurate<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.740> wii

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
tracking is a lot more accurate for wii

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
tracking is a lot more accurate for wii
remote<00:01:17.310> than<00:01:17.910> for<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.360> things<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:18.869> are

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
remote than for these things these are

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380 
remote than for these things these are
just<00:01:19.200> truly<00:01:19.680> based<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.100> accelerometers<00:01:20.820> which

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
just truly based on accelerometers which

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.300 
just truly based on accelerometers which
detect<00:01:21.720> variations<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.360> speed<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
detect variations and speed and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
detect variations and speed and
variations<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.580> tilt<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:29.780> even<00:01:30.780> though<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
variations and tilt but even though the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.430 
variations and tilt but even though the
tab<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> differed<00:01:32.940> camera<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:34.200> still

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
tab that differed camera it is still

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.980 
tab that differed camera it is still
pretty<00:01:34.590> accurate<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.580> am<00:01:36.119> able<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.510> move<00:01:36.810> around

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pretty accurate I am able to move around

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.830 
pretty accurate I am able to move around
and<00:01:37.380> house<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.970> sure<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.330> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.510> camera

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and house I sure can see on the camera

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
and house I sure can see on the camera
here<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.950> yeah<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.850> came<00:01:41.970> around<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.270> cursor<00:01:43.520> do

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
here but yeah I came around my cursor do

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.460 
here but yeah I came around my cursor do
I<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.880> moving<00:01:45.360> my<00:01:47.330> my<00:01:48.330> hand<00:01:48.630> left<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> right

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.500 

the<00:01:52.470> installations<00:01:53.310> he<00:01:53.430> came<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.210> few

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
the installations he came with a few

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.280 
the installations he came with a few
games<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.220> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> crappy<00:01:57.290> I've

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
games but you're all kind of crappy I've

games but you're all kind of crappy I've
no<00:01:58.470> idea<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.159> things<00:01:59.189> came<00:01:59.700> out<00:02:00.380> I

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
no idea when these things came out I

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.789 
no idea when these things came out I
couldn't<00:02:02.400> find<00:02:02.580> any<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.600> recent<00:02:04.080> drivers<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
couldn't find any more recent drivers I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.330 
couldn't find any more recent drivers I
could<00:02:04.950> say<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> whenever<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.229> launched<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
could say and so whenever I launched the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.940 
could say and so whenever I launched the
software<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.330> always<00:02:09.950> scaled-down

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
software it always scaled-down

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.190 
software it always scaled-down

I<00:02:28.819> was<00:02:28.940> wondering<00:02:29.299> if<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.959> could<00:02:29.989> map<00:02:30.409> them<00:02:30.620> out

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
I was wondering if I could map them out

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.220 
I was wondering if I could map them out
for<00:02:31.010> fallout<00:02:31.400> 3<00:02:31.640> make<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.390> bit<00:02:33.049> more

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
for fallout 3 make it bit more
