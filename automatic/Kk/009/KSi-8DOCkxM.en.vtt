00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.010
 hello gives them the order to learn to 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.110
 driving today I'm going to tell you how to pass 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.330
 a policeman lying down part two 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.000
 another one of the types of police lying down 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.980
 that if it's policemen lying down like 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 We are already in Colombia continuously or 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.079
 is not like what we saw that is in two 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.079
 in two parts of the village that a lot 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.579
 people unfortunately especially of 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.559
 motorcyclists who can go through the 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:32.090
 half that is, they slow us down 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:34.129
 the policeman loses his purpose and the other 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.890
 is that many times people in the 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.050
 cars pull the tires on the left 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.590
 or from the right to go through the middle 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.940
 what then causes a something a 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.940
 anomaly because the car is being 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.620
 leaving his lane to move to a 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.750
 part of our lane or to get off 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.130
 practically in half then it's going to 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 show this policeman lying down 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.740
 which is in this case very well demarcated 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.110
 yes as you can see there is a line 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.780
 before the policeman on the side that is 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.760
 erasing we are going to see a car that in 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.800
 this time will happen the police 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.909
 let's see how he does it 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.549
 the car reduces the speed 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.939
 and it passes slowly with safety is the 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.170
 car does not have to not stopped at all 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.210
 you realized that it did not stop the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.189
 everything and the safest thing is that the change in 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.020
 who came then I keep it because 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.259
 this is a gentle slope 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.880
 this embassy there is step to the motorcycle is a 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.530
 pending what implies that he 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.649
 only with sinking a little bit the plus 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.420
 the policeman can pass by without 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.789
 that the car will be paid if 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.280
 place in the next change can be 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.899
 third or second and for the police has 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.099
 cost let's see again how 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.099
 they would pay another two cables 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 observe the jump the bank is that what 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.840
 they pay a little bit like we're going to 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.420
 pass us let's pass the police 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 side we come to him 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.900
 in is pending we can go in second 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.900
 we sink gently close 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.210
 and we let the car go through its 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.009
 momentum close and a little floren 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.619
 obviously as I told them how are we going in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.740
 pending then we let the car 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.000
 pass with your momentum then how are you going to 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.690
 you pass when he lieth 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.819
 they are inclined they arrive and one of clos 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.239
 gently and brake also the brakes yes 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.129
 and to the extent that the police are passing 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.409
 you are releasing the close so that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.329
 already the kart finishes passing with his 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.819
 boost is a way to pay a police 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.620
 lying on a slope embassy with 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.819
 a lot of security we have in the next one in 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.819
 the known garment until then
