00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.080
 hello today we are going to teach this handkerchief 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.200
 made of black bodies 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.190
 It's quite easy to do, okay, we 're going. 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.800
 need the lan in front of a 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.230
 crochet number 4 and scissors 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.750
 Here I am going to show you how to 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:34.870
 We know him and we'll do it. 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.150
 crochet chain that is very easy 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.799
 here I 'm only going to make a piece just for 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.549
 You had notion. 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:47.559
 about one meter and twenty 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.780
 length that I 'll show later 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.239
 How was it for you? 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.970
 I'll take the dummy and show it to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.940
 What are you doing the chains? 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.220
 I had me do the size if you think 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.500
 you have to make it smaller or larger if you can 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:09.399
 do no problem to give a skein 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.469
 I make the one in that size still left 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:17.469
 a bit of na I made a toll of 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.619
 Now I'm going to start doing 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:24.609
 with the secret point I make a 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:28.420
 to stretch this chain is the 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:32.439
 second from a loop and secure here in the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.369
 and I'm going to make a point more 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:42.130
 half of this release I gave here already 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:47.140
 It has a half point again and one Chico 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.579
 and I make a low in 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:57.359
 I will measure this lassad 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.359
 and I'm going to close a low 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.270
 and here I will do it again 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 until I make a career and it's launched 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.660
 I made a low point in that release 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:19.870
 stretch again I make a low 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:25.450
 inside the loop that is the point 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.959
 Secret that he is very handsome to give 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.280
 finish even in knitting you can give 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.250
 finish with only a half point and is 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.860
 very quick 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.920
 How are we going to do it? 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.269
 we turn our work and we will stretch 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 and again this point doing half 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.810
 point or half point 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.350
 I come here and noticed pine and my 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:02.470
 eye and do a little but a point 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.000
 I hurt a little pinch I caught him 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.030
 because I have to leave it closed 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.680
 stico doha launched and let's get it all started 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.410
 again 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.730
 We're going to do all the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.390
 careers we are reducing the port 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.390
 it gets smaller 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:32.650
 and this point you can do not only the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.689
 teaching how you can make muse in 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.470
 that looks good you put on a camisetinha 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.540
 by male the same with a second skin 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.599
 Look, I came in. I went wrong here. I did the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.989
 Last last point and how we go 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.049
 close by making a chain and 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.480
 They cut the wire will cut the wind over the 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:59.290
 size of the fringe we're going to make 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:02.569
 look the one I found in the triangle 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.349
 with the measurement of the fringe I 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.239
 I always take a notebook to measure I go 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.109
 scroll as many times as necessary 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.310
 here on the tip in all the bathrooms 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.280
 we will cut 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.889
 I'm just going to do a show I always 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:27.160
 god found the bridge 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:33.190
 I always put two wires in each bicam 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:37.360
 each little flower divides the medium 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:43.190
 I put a needle on the first end 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.949
 look at a loop another loop and pull and 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:52.210
 so I'll do it in all the dots 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:56.900
 down where I made the drawing 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:02.180
 drey in half released another launched 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:06.050
 and I pull and this is how our 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.970
 Do not even look beautiful and wonderful. 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.630
 Look how it's taken just for you to see how 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.630
 he stayed 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.900
 This is ours - I hope you have 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.830
 liked and watch 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.830
