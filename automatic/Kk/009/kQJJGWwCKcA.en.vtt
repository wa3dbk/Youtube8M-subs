00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.839 

we<00:02:12.780> hardly<00:02:12.959> ever<00:02:13.110> use<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.769> because<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.370> were

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
we hardly ever use that because we were

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.920 
we hardly ever use that because we were
just<00:02:15.060> VFR<00:02:15.860> we<00:02:16.860> got<00:02:17.100> our<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.760> radar<00:02:18.600> altimeter

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
just VFR we got our out radar altimeter

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.660 
just VFR we got our out radar altimeter
telling<00:02:19.470> us<00:02:19.560> how<00:02:19.709> high<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.130> are<00:02:20.160> above<00:02:20.549> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
telling us how high we are above the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.910 
telling us how high we are above the
ground<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.570> our<00:02:21.870> altimeter<00:02:22.200> telling<00:02:22.680> us<00:02:22.769> the

ground and our altimeter telling us the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.950 
ground and our altimeter telling us the
absolute

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
absolute

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.830 
absolute
elevation<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.360> keep<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.660> right

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
elevation so we like to keep it right

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.770 
elevation so we like to keep it right
there<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.380> then<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:30.030> next<00:02:30.270> page<00:02:30.510> is

you here you're big now we'll take you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.270 
you here you're big now we'll take you
over<00:03:23.400> let's<00:03:23.879> say<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.319> 34<00:03:25.319> back<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.189> the

over let's say it's 34 back to the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.289 
over let's say it's 34 back to the
little<00:03:26.430> knob<00:03:26.670> back<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.689> big<00:03:27.900> knob<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:29.299> nine

little knob back to the big knob to nine

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.910 
little knob back to the big knob to nine
or<00:03:31.260> seven<00:03:33.260> one<00:03:34.260> nine<00:03:34.849> whatever<00:03:36.049> zero<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.319> then

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
or seven one nine whatever zero and then

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.300 
or seven one nine whatever zero and then
you<00:03:37.950> keep<00:03:38.280> going<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.670> big<00:03:38.849> knob<00:03:39.060> around<00:03:39.659> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
you keep going the big knob around to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.759 
you keep going the big knob around to
that's<00:03:41.310> let's<00:03:41.819> say<00:03:42.000> seven<00:03:43.459> nine<00:03:45.439> two<00:03:46.439> three

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
that's let's say seven nine two three

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.460 
that's let's say seven nine two three
and<00:03:47.010> then<00:03:47.730> let's<00:03:48.000> say<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.659> the<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
and then let's say that this is the the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.699 
and then let's say that this is the the
GPS<00:03:49.920> coordinates<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.639> want<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.530> then<00:03:52.530> we

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
GPS coordinates that we want and then we

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.500 
GPS coordinates that we want and then we
hit<00:03:53.389> direct<00:03:55.010> enter<00:03:56.010> enter

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
hit direct enter enter

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.190 
hit direct enter enter
all<00:03:59.019> right<00:03:59.200> now

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
all right now

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.690 
all right now
that<00:04:01.800> takes<00:04:02.130> us<00:04:02.900> takes<00:04:03.900> us<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> scene<00:04:04.700> but

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
that takes us takes us to the scene but

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.550 
that takes us takes us to the scene but
it<00:04:05.849> puts<00:04:06.090> us<00:04:06.300> you'll<00:04:06.660> see<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.290> first

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
it puts us you'll see at the first

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.920 
it puts us you'll see at the first
navigation<00:04:08.310> page<00:04:08.580> we<00:04:09.239> really<00:04:09.599> want<00:04:09.780> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
navigation page we really want the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.130 
navigation page we really want the
second<00:04:10.410> navigation<00:04:10.620> page<00:04:11.750> but<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.959> that

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
second navigation page but and that

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.080 
second navigation page but and that
gives<00:04:13.410> us<00:04:13.590> where<00:04:14.310> we're<00:04:14.489> going

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
gives us where we're going

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.470 
gives us where we're going
a<00:04:15.120> heading<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.070> 252<00:04:17.070> degrees<00:04:17.430> for<00:04:17.820> 70<00:04:18.269> nautical

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
a heading of 252 degrees for 70 nautical

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.510 
a heading of 252 degrees for 70 nautical
miles<00:04:19.700> then<00:04:20.700> we<00:04:20.910> split<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.109> half<00:04:22.139> for<00:04:23.010> 35

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
miles then we split that in half for 35

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.520 
miles then we split that in half for 35
and<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:23.850> take<00:04:24.030> us<00:04:24.180> 35<00:04:24.510> minutes<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.260> go<00:04:25.380> though

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and then take us 35 minutes to go though

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.940 
and then take us 35 minutes to go though
70<00:04:25.980> nautical<00:04:26.220> miles<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.780> that's<00:04:27.990> your<00:04:28.200> nav<00:04:28.560> and

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
70 nautical miles so that's your nav and

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.330 
70 nautical miles so that's your nav and
your<00:04:29.430> waypoint<00:04:30.620> auxilary<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.919> don't<00:04:32.130> really

your waypoint auxilary you don't really

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.190 
your waypoint auxilary you don't really
need<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.450> got<00:04:33.630> interesting

programmed<00:05:42.310> right<00:05:42.760> we<00:05:43.300> have<00:05:43.479> all<00:05:43.750> these

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
programmed right we have all these

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.200 
programmed right we have all these
waypoints<00:05:44.139> already<00:05:44.800> program<00:05:45.280> programmed<00:05:45.970> in

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
waypoints already program programmed in

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.920 
waypoints already program programmed in
so<00:05:46.570> if<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.960> was<00:05:47.520> Loris<00:05:48.520> so<00:05:49.479> if<00:05:49.600> it's<00:05:49.720> the<00:05:49.810> only
