00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello and welcome on how 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 photograph points like small colin 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.860
 series on marriage so today I 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.750
 always seems to you in church for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.170
 still married pictures at church I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.789
 will tell you about the kind you 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 tweaks it autofocus mode 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 use the auto focus for it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 works well there has to be some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.980
 light and contrasts so in 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 terms of light we will have 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 a lot to the church so but of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.230
 contrast one has between a husband in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.149
 black as a rule it's not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 still the case now but black and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 white so we had to contrast the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.879
 contrast we will have the autofocus mode 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.480
 you go you can take a mode 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.430
 for static subject a one shot mode 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.079
 when it's the ceremony when it's not 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.739
 not move on the other hand if you are going to be 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.850
 forced to take an autofocus mode 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 mobile for mobile subjects 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 when people come into the church 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.090
 the newlyweds enter the church for 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 follow them to you have to take a mode 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.940
 autofocus that will work for 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 dynamic topics 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 I made a video about the system 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 autofocus so I refer you on on 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.140
 this video there to have more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.130
 information but 3d autofocus mode 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.450
 for dynamic subject when people 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.610
 return to the church the newlyweds 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.189
 get into the church and ditto when they 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.720
 go out so do not forget to change 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.290
 fashion what you can have 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.820
 little surprises 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.759
 at the same time when you are putting 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.409
 to the point as there is little light 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.170
 put the central collimator is like 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.250
 it will support you slightly on the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.780
 trigger you make your bet 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.880
 point you will look at you are doing the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 photo would be once you have a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.270
 dynamic autofocus it will be difficult if 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.770
 you are doing your tuning for 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.329
 crop the other focus will go more 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 far from a few so wished 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.350
 during the ceremony when nothing moves 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:52.830
 one shot autofocus for static subject 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.590
 to efes I believe 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.500
 and when people go out the bride and groom 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:05.340
 come out of the church autofocus for 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.020
 dynamic subject afc here I was listening I 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.850
