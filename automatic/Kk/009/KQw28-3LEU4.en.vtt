hi<00:00:10.769> everybody<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.340> week<00:00:11.550> we're<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> be

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
hi everybody this week we're going to be

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.879 
hi everybody this week we're going to be
talking<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.509> basics<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.200> exposure

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
talking about the basics of exposure

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.890 
talking about the basics of exposure
now<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.519> because<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:15.000> stuff<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.330> basic

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
now just because this stuff is basic

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.660 
now just because this stuff is basic
doesn't<00:00:16.230> mean<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.619> important<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.490> let's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
doesn't mean it's not important so let's

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.490 
doesn't mean it's not important so let's
dive<00:00:17.880> right<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:19.050> week<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
dive right in this week we had a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.830 
dive right in this week we had a
question<00:00:19.680> from<00:00:20.070> David<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.699> seer<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.270> David

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
question from David a seer and David

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.990 
question from David a seer and David
wrote<00:00:22.020> could<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.590> please<00:00:22.859> explain<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.640> so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
wrote could you please explain the so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.609 
wrote could you please explain the so
called<00:00:24.300> exposure<00:00:24.990> triangle

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
called exposure triangle

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.169 
called exposure triangle
well<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> exposure<00:00:29.099> triangle<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.730> made<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
well the exposure triangle is made up of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
well the exposure triangle is made up of
three<00:00:30.630> things

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
three things

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
three things
it's<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.859> aperture<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.820> shutter<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.360> ISO

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it's the aperture the shutter and ISO

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
it's the aperture the shutter and ISO
now<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.800> understand<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.489> let<00:00:35.700> me<00:00:35.730> explain<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
now to understand this let me explain to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
now to understand this let me explain to
you<00:00:36.329> how<00:00:36.390> light<00:00:36.780> enters<00:00:37.230> our<00:00:37.350> camera<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you how light enters our camera and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
you how light enters our camera and
makes<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> picture<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> goes<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
makes a picture when it goes into the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
makes a picture when it goes into the
lens<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.680> has<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> pass<00:00:41.250> through<00:00:41.280> something

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
lens it has to pass through something

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
lens it has to pass through something
called<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:42.390> aperture<00:00:43.020> after<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.980> goes<00:00:44.070> through

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
called an aperture after it goes through

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
called an aperture after it goes through
the<00:00:44.489> aperture<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> passes<00:00:45.450> through<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the aperture it passes through the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.990 
the aperture it passes through the
shutter<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> finally<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> hits<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.550> sensor

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
shutter and finally it hits the sensor

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
shutter and finally it hits the sensor
in<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.480> camera<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> sensor<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.039> sort<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
in your camera now the sensor is sort of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
in your camera now the sensor is sort of
like<00:00:50.430> film<00:00:50.820> used<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.539> gathers<00:00:52.050> light

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
like film used to be it gathers light

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
like film used to be it gathers light
and<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.770> makes<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> photo<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.730> let's<00:00:53.910> talk<00:00:54.030> about

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and it makes a photo so let's talk about

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
and it makes a photo so let's talk about
these<00:00:54.449> things<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> time<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> first

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
these things one at a time now the first

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760 
these things one at a time now the first
thing<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.699> aperture<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.899> aperture<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.559> sort

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
thing is aperture now aperture is sort

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
thing is aperture now aperture is sort
of<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> hole<00:00:59.489> inside<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.120> lens<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.480> it's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of like a hole inside your lens now it's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
of like a hole inside your lens now it's
not<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> hole<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.289> sort<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.039> what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
not a hole it's sort of like one in what

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640 
not a hole it's sort of like one in what
I<00:01:02.550> mean<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.239> always<00:01:03.629> open<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.500> get

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
I mean is it's always open it can get

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490 
I mean is it's always open it can get
larger<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.309> smaller<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.510> controls<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
larger or smaller and it controls the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
larger or smaller and it controls the
quantity<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> light<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.420> goes<00:01:09.570> through<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
quantity of light that goes through the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
quantity of light that goes through the
lens<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> aperture<00:01:11.580> has<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> wide

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
lens so if the aperture has a wide

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
lens so if the aperture has a wide
opening<00:01:12.750> lots<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.470> light<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.159> through

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
opening lots of light is going through

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.940 
opening lots of light is going through
it<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> small<00:01:15.360> opening<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:16.710> light

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it as a small opening not so much light

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800 
it as a small opening not so much light
is<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.340> through<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.090> second<00:01:18.509> thing<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
is going through now the second thing is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.760 
is going through now the second thing is
called<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> shutter

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
called the shutter

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
called the shutter
now<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> shutter<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> aperture

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
now the shutter is not like the aperture

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
now the shutter is not like the aperture
because<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.110> either<00:01:22.259> open<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:22.890> closed<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
because it's either open or closed so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
because it's either open or closed so
it's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.360> open<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> time<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's not open all the time now the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's not open all the time now the
difference<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.640> shutter<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.150> open<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
difference is the shutter can open and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.990 
difference is the shutter can open and
close<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.990> different<00:01:28.409> speeds<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> controls

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
close at different speeds so it controls

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
close at different speeds so it controls
the<00:01:30.240> duration<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> light<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.130> open

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the duration of the light so it can open

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
the duration of the light so it can open
up<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> few<00:01:32.970> seconds<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.740> fraction<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
up for a few seconds or a fraction of a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.010 
up for a few seconds or a fraction of a
second<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.610> again<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> shutter<00:01:36.180> controls<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
second so again the shutter controls the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.899 
second so again the shutter controls the
duration<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.650> light<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.610> open<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
duration of light now if it's open a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
duration of light now if it's open a
long<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.329> lots<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> light<00:01:40.320> goes<00:01:40.530> through<00:01:40.770> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
long time lots of light goes through if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100 
long time lots of light goes through if
it's<00:01:41.189> open<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> short<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:42.210> less<00:01:42.840> light

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it's open for a short time less light

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's open for a short time less light
goes<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.380> well<00:01:43.979> let's<00:01:44.159> talk<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.369> how

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
goes through well let's talk about how

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
goes through well let's talk about how
our<00:01:45.000> shutter<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> aperture<00:01:45.899> work<00:01:46.619> together

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
our shutter and aperture work together

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.240 
our shutter and aperture work together
to<00:01:47.460> keep<00:01:47.670> things<00:01:48.060> balanced<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:49.439> remember<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to keep things balanced now remember the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.469 
to keep things balanced now remember the
stuff<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:50.670> talking<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.030> today<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
stuff that I'm talking about today the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.880 
stuff that I'm talking about today the
specific<00:01:51.930> numbers<00:01:52.259> well<00:01:52.560> they're<00:01:52.680> all

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
specific numbers well they're all

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
specific numbers well they're all
relative<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.640> please<00:01:53.850> don't<00:01:54.090> email<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.600> say

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
relative so please don't email and say

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
relative so please don't email and say
that<00:01:54.899> those<00:01:55.079> numbers<00:01:55.320> don't<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.799> out

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that those numbers don't work out

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
that those numbers don't work out
because<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.790> trying<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> teach<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> some

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
because I'm trying to teach you some

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.179 
because I'm trying to teach you some
principles<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.500> numbers<00:01:58.770> won't<00:01:59.040> work

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
principles and the numbers won't work

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.440 
principles and the numbers won't work
out<00:01:59.310> they're<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.969> illustrative

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
out they're just for illustrative

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
out they're just for illustrative
purposes<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.500> again<00:02:01.680> let's<00:02:01.860> talk<00:02:01.979> about<00:02:02.219> how

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
purposes so again let's talk about how

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.249 
purposes so again let's talk about how
the<00:02:02.369> aperture<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> shutter<00:02:03.119> work<00:02:04.079> together

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the aperture and shutter work together

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.980 
the aperture and shutter work together
as<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> team<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.460> keep<00:02:05.640> our<00:02:05.880> light<00:02:06.090> balance<00:02:06.869> so

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
as a team to keep our light balance so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.109 
as a team to keep our light balance so
we<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> proper<00:02:07.770> exposure<00:02:08.129> well<00:02:08.819> let's<00:02:08.970> say

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
we get a proper exposure well let's say

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
we get a proper exposure well let's say
that<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.989> wide<00:02:10.440> open<00:02:11.009> aperture

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that we have a really wide open aperture

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.730 
that we have a really wide open aperture
well<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> let<00:02:12.900> through<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
well that's going to let through a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
well that's going to let through a
of<00:02:13.980> light<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.910> lot<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.240> light

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
of light and we have a lot of light

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.090 
of light and we have a lot of light
coming<00:02:15.900> through<00:02:15.930> our<00:02:16.170> lens<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.770> need<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
coming through our lens we need to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340 
coming through our lens we need to
balance<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.910> somehow<00:02:18.180> well<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.170> use<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
balance that somehow well we can use a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.010 
balance that somehow well we can use a
really<00:02:19.830> fast<00:02:20.310> shutter<00:02:20.790> speed<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.720> fast

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
really fast shutter speed and that fast

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.930 
really fast shutter speed and that fast
shutter<00:02:22.350> speed<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.250> balance<00:02:23.730> out

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
shutter speed is going to balance out

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600 
shutter speed is going to balance out
how<00:02:24.420> much<00:02:24.570> light<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.020> coming<00:02:25.260> through<00:02:25.380> now<00:02:26.370> if

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
how much light is coming through now if

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.190 
how much light is coming through now if
we<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> exact<00:02:27.420> opposite<00:02:27.840> let's<00:02:28.020> say

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
we have the exact opposite let's say

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200 
we have the exact opposite let's say
that<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.560> had<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> really<00:02:29.040> small<00:02:29.610> aperture

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
that we had a really small aperture

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.270 
that we had a really small aperture
opening<00:02:30.570> well<00:02:30.840> less<00:02:31.410> light<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.920> coming

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
opening well less light is coming

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.980 
opening well less light is coming
through<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.670> lens<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.720> less

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
through the lens and if we have less

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.900 
through the lens and if we have less
light<00:02:34.290> coming<00:02:34.620> through<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> lens<00:02:35.040> well<00:02:35.520> we

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
light coming through the lens well we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.910 
light coming through the lens well we
need<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> take<00:02:36.270> our<00:02:36.450> shutter<00:02:36.630> speed<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> slow

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
need to take our shutter speed and slow

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.880 
need to take our shutter speed and slow
it<00:02:38.070> down<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.640> make<00:02:38.790> up<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.660> lower

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
it down to make up for the lower

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
it down to make up for the lower
quantity<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.100> light<00:02:41.520> now<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.380> in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
quantity of light now we can do this in

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.290 
quantity of light now we can do this in
a<00:02:43.680> couple<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.070> ways<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.550> some<00:02:44.760> modes<00:02:45.030> on

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
a couple of ways we have some modes on

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.360 
a couple of ways we have some modes on
our<00:02:45.450> camera<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.260> help<00:02:46.440> us<00:02:46.590> calculate<00:02:47.130> how<00:02:47.310> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
our camera that help us calculate how to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
our camera that help us calculate how to
set<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> shutter<00:02:48.120> speed<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> aperture

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
set the shutter speed or the aperture

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
set the shutter speed or the aperture
value<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.160> first<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.790> called<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.210> it's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
value the first one is called this it's

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.560 
value the first one is called this it's
aperture<00:02:52.200> priority<00:02:52.500> mode<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> Canon<00:02:54.210> it's<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
aperture priority mode on a Canon it's a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.200 
aperture priority mode on a Canon it's a
V<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.500> your<00:02:56.040> mode<00:02:56.310> dial<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.820> stands<00:02:57.090> for

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
V on your mode dial that stands for

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.050 
V on your mode dial that stands for
aperture<00:02:57.900> value<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.800> Nikon<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.910> other

aperture value on Nikon and other

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.720 
aperture value on Nikon and other
cameras<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.990> called<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.380> for<00:03:02.040> aperture

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
cameras is just called a for aperture

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.730 
cameras is just called a for aperture
now<00:03:03.210> what<00:03:03.390> happens<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.200> set<00:03:04.620> your

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
now what happens here is you set your

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.980 
now what happens here is you set your
camera's<00:03:05.190> aperture<00:03:05.820> value<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.660> other<00:03:06.810> words

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
camera's aperture value in other words

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.600 
camera's aperture value in other words
how<00:03:07.080> wide<00:03:07.380> or<00:03:07.410> how<00:03:07.650> small<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.220> aperture

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
how wide or how small the aperture

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.460 
how wide or how small the aperture
opening<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.240> then<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> camera<00:03:10.110> will

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
opening is and then the camera will

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.680 
opening is and then the camera will
figure<00:03:10.710> out<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.250> proper<00:03:11.490> shutter<00:03:12.150> speed<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
figure out the proper shutter speed and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.600 
figure out the proper shutter speed and
things<00:03:12.990> will<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.380> balance<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.340> can<00:03:14.490> do

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
things will be in balance now you can do

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.790 
things will be in balance now you can do
the<00:03:14.730> exact<00:03:15.090> opposite<00:03:15.630> by<00:03:15.780> using<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.410> shutter

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
the exact opposite by using the shutter

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.790 
the exact opposite by using the shutter
priority<00:03:17.220> mode<00:03:17.730> now<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> canon<00:03:19.110> camera<00:03:19.500> this

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
priority mode now on a canon camera this

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.910 
priority mode now on a canon camera this
is<00:03:19.860> T<00:03:20.310> V<00:03:20.340> for<00:03:21.090> time<00:03:21.510> value<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.710> other

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
is T V for time value and on other

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.460 
is T V for time value and on other
cameras<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.670> s<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:24.270> shutter<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.930> in

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
cameras is just s for shutter and in

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.050 
cameras is just s for shutter and in
this<00:03:25.650> mode<00:03:25.950> what<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.670> set<00:03:26.910> your

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
this mode what you do is you set your

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.030 
this mode what you do is you set your
shutter<00:03:27.330> speed<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> specific<00:03:28.560> speed<00:03:28.830> and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
shutter speed to a specific speed and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.590 
shutter speed to a specific speed and
then<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.520> camera<00:03:29.880> will<00:03:30.030> figure<00:03:30.180> out<00:03:30.300> how

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
then the camera will figure out how

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.950 
then the camera will figure out how
large<00:03:30.960> or<00:03:31.260> how<00:03:31.710> small<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.850> aperture<00:03:33.540> opening

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
large or how small the aperture opening

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.930 
large or how small the aperture opening
should<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.370> far<00:03:35.580> we've<00:03:35.730> talked<00:03:35.910> about

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
should be so so far we've talked about

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.670 
should be so so far we've talked about
aperture<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.840> shutter<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.350> how<00:03:37.440> those<00:03:37.620> two

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
aperture and shutter and how those two

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.620 
aperture and shutter and how those two
things<00:03:38.100> work<00:03:38.280> together<00:03:38.460> to<00:03:39.000> keep<00:03:39.180> things<00:03:39.450> in

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
things work together to keep things in

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.190 
things work together to keep things in
balance

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
balance

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.800 
balance
now<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.890> about<00:03:41.010> ISO<00:03:41.820> how<00:03:42.240> does<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.600> work

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
now what about ISO how does that work

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.530 
now what about ISO how does that work
well<00:03:43.410> ISO<00:03:44.280> controls<00:03:44.700> our<00:03:45.030> cameras

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
well ISO controls our cameras

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.080 
well ISO controls our cameras
sensitivity<00:03:46.530> now<00:03:47.100> let<00:03:47.220> me<00:03:47.310> talk<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.000> about

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
sensitivity now let me talk to you about

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.660 
sensitivity now let me talk to you about
it<00:03:48.270> like<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.950> let's<00:03:49.950> pretend<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.610> I

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
it like this let's pretend you and I

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.520 
it like this let's pretend you and I

bit<00:03:54.150> late<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:54.600> we<00:03:55.020> go<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.470> ticket<00:03:55.740> counter

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
bit late so we go to the ticket counter

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.800 
bit late so we go to the ticket counter
grab<00:03:56.580> our<00:03:56.760> tickets<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.180> make<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.690> the

well unfortunately we can't see a thing
and<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.100> can't<00:04:02.310> find<00:04:02.550> our<00:04:02.730> seats<00:04:03.000> because<00:04:03.210> it's

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
and we can't find our seats because it's

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.690 
and we can't find our seats because it's
too<00:04:03.690> dark<00:04:04.050> in<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.350> theatre<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.220> we<00:04:05.400> wait<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> few

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
too dark in the theatre so we wait a few

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.150 
too dark in the theatre so we wait a few
minutes<00:04:05.970> our<00:04:06.420> eyes<00:04:06.660> adjust<00:04:07.140> we<00:04:07.530> find<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.860> couple

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
minutes our eyes adjust we find a couple

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.740 
minutes our eyes adjust we find a couple
of<00:04:08.280> seats<00:04:08.460> and<00:04:08.670> we<00:04:08.760> settle<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.390> watch<00:04:09.540> our

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
of seats and we settle in and watch our

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.390 
of seats and we settle in and watch our
movie<00:04:09.990> after<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.560> movie<00:04:10.770> was<00:04:10.890> finished<00:04:11.100> we

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
movie after the movie was finished we

movie after the movie was finished we
decide<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.850> go<00:04:11.970> have<00:04:12.150> some<00:04:12.360> coffee<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:12.780> chat

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
decide to go have some coffee and chat

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.380 
decide to go have some coffee and chat
about<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.470> film<00:04:13.680> when<00:04:14.340> we<00:04:14.460> walk<00:04:14.700> outside<00:04:14.910> were

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
about the film when we walk outside were

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.300 
about the film when we walk outside were
blinded<00:04:15.870> by<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.080> bright<00:04:16.350> sunlight<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.920> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
blinded by the bright sunlight and it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.610 
blinded by the bright sunlight and it
takes<00:04:17.489> your<00:04:17.609> eyes<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> few<00:04:18.180> minutes<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.570> adjust

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
takes your eyes a few minutes to adjust

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.850 
takes your eyes a few minutes to adjust
well<00:04:21.340> ISO<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> lot<00:04:22.330> like<00:04:22.510> our<00:04:22.780> eyes<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.800> that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
well ISO is a lot like our eyes in that

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.580 
well ISO is a lot like our eyes in that
it<00:04:24.280> can<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:24.550> more<00:04:24.820> or<00:04:24.880> less<00:04:25.150> sensitive<00:04:26.110> to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
it can be more or less sensitive to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.800 
it can be more or less sensitive to
light<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.090> ISO<00:04:28.090> numbers<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.570> are<00:04:28.690> really

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
light so ISO numbers that are really

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.550 
light so ISO numbers that are really
high<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.320> ISO<00:04:29.800> 1600<00:04:30.370> or<00:04:30.729> 3200<00:04:31.690> allows<00:04:32.350> our

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
high like ISO 1600 or 3200 allows our

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.620 
high like ISO 1600 or 3200 allows our
sensor<00:04:32.979> to<00:04:33.190> shoot<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.610> low-light<00:04:34.240> situations

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
sensor to shoot in low-light situations

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.140 
sensor to shoot in low-light situations
just<00:04:35.440> like<00:04:35.530> our<00:04:35.740> eyes<00:04:35.889> could<00:04:36.160> see<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.880> dark

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
just like our eyes could see in a dark

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.450 
just like our eyes could see in a dark
Theater<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.930> ISO<00:04:38.710> numbers<00:04:39.010> that<00:04:39.190> are<00:04:39.280> very

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
Theater and ISO numbers that are very

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.870 
Theater and ISO numbers that are very
low<00:04:39.760> like<00:04:40.090> ISO<00:04:40.630> 100<00:04:41.260> or<00:04:41.380> 200<00:04:41.830> allow<00:04:42.370> our<00:04:42.580> camera

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
low like ISO 100 or 200 allow our camera

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.460 
low like ISO 100 or 200 allow our camera
to<00:04:42.940> be<00:04:43.030> less<00:04:43.240> sensitive<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.720> light<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.139> we<00:04:44.350> can

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
to be less sensitive to light so we can

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.439 
to be less sensitive to light so we can
shoot<00:04:44.680> in<00:04:44.830> bright<00:04:45.220> sunny<00:04:45.610> days

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
shoot in bright sunny days

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.780 
shoot in bright sunny days
well<00:04:47.199> now<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.560> shows<00:04:48.310> us<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.580> we<00:04:48.699> have

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
well now that shows us that we have

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.969 
well now that shows us that we have
three<00:04:49.150> things<00:04:49.479> that<00:04:49.750> work<00:04:49.990> together<00:04:50.260> to

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
three things that work together to

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.430 
three things that work together to
control<00:04:51.310> exposure<00:04:51.729> aperture<00:04:52.660> shutter<00:04:52.840> and

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
control exposure aperture shutter and

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.980 
control exposure aperture shutter and
ISO<00:04:54.180> now<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.240> might<00:04:55.450> be<00:04:55.570> asking<00:04:55.930> yourself

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
ISO now you might be asking yourself

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.930
