drop<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.070> kind<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.520> em<00:01:23.670> action<00:01:23.970> MMO<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.930> not

week<00:04:40.560> basically<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:41.980> sort<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.450> thinking

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
week basically it is sort of thinking

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.100 
week basically it is sort of thinking
then<00:04:43.840> think<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.880> at<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.030> NGE<00:04:46.420> for<00:04:46.780> Star<00:04:46.960> Wars

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
then think of at the NGE for Star Wars

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.530 
then think of at the NGE for Star Wars
Galaxies<00:04:47.590> if<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> NGE<00:04:48.160> didn't<00:04:48.580> suck<00:04:48.880> what<00:04:49.420> it

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
Galaxies if the NGE didn't suck what it

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.180 
Galaxies if the NGE didn't suck what it
does<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:50.020> going<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.200> lower<00:04:50.470> your<00:04:50.770> time<00:04:51.040> to

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
does is it's going to lower your time to

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.610 
does is it's going to lower your time to
kill<00:04:51.370> on<00:04:51.640> monsters<00:04:52.180> for<00:04:52.510> for<00:04:53.110> newer<00:04:53.290> players

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
kill on monsters for for newer players

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.260 
kill on monsters for for newer players
and<00:04:53.860> across<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.160> board<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:54.850> should<00:04:55.120> make

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
and across the board so it should make

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.570 
and across the board so it should make
combat<00:04:55.750> less<00:04:56.260> of<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.470> chore<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.860> get<00:04:57.250> through

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
combat less of a chore to get through

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.700 
combat less of a chore to get through
obviously<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.690> hard<00:04:58.900> monsters<00:04:59.320> will<00:04:59.500> still

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
obviously the hard monsters will still

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.740 
obviously the hard monsters will still
be<00:04:59.830> hard<00:05:00.070> but<00:05:00.220> they<00:05:00.370> sort<00:05:00.670> of<00:05:00.760> took<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.420> ones

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
be hard but they sort of took the ones

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.300 
be hard but they sort of took the ones
