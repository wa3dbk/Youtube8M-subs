00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.001
 We are in the Atraska Museum 

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.606
 in the Vatican Museums in Rome, and we are currently looking at my favorite 

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:15.244
 the amphora of the whole world. I see why your favorite. 

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:19.185
 It seems almost glowing. That's why she's so famous, 

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.670
 are the two characters and, despite the simplicity of the image, 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.733
 it gives us a lot of information. The heroes are 

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.910
 Achilles on the left and Ajax on the right, a lady of the great Greek 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.972
 heroes from Homer's Iliad. Ексекий, 

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:38.808
 the vasepist, signed only under two vases like the potter and the creator 

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:42.800
 a visitor, has identified the two figures as being 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.837
 he wrote their names over them. He also told us what was happening 

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:50.438
 between them. Achilles on the left says the word 

00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:54.749
 four - "Tesra". The right shows how 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.333
 Ajax says three - "Tri". 

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:03.091
 We immediately understand that Achilles wins the game they both play. 

00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:07.137
 But this, of course, is a metaphor of how myth will develop. 

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:10.512
 On each side we see their shields. Achilles 

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:17.336
 Still wearing his helmet, even though Ajax has lowered his own - so watch a moment of peace between the battles. 

00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:22.170
 They are on the battlefield around Troy. Ekskeki reveals more information here, 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.748
 not just the casting of the dice, but also in a broader sense their destinies. 

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:33.742
 Look how, for example, although the two figures are lowered and focused their attention on the current game, 

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:37.037
 and without forgetting, they are very close friends, 

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:42.669
 so here watching intimacy, brotherhood. However, Achilles, who has a higher role, 

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:47.150
 has dropped his spears, it is seen how their tops are distant. 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.104
 Lines of copies that are not parallel are shown below. 

00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:55.279
 But look at the figure on the right - Ajax, whose spears are laid more parallel to one another, 

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.248
 from which it is understood that he actually clings to them, 

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:02.607
 that it's tense. Part of this tension is also written on his forehead. 

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:10.941
 Yes that is right. If you look closely, you will see that Achilles eyebrow is depicted in a single line. 

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:17.004
 While for Ajax two lines are used, which probably implies his tension. 

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.919
 Another detail that is very easy to see, although it carries a lot of symbolism in itself: 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.914
 look at the steps of the two figures. 

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:27.376
 Achilles is again calm, relaxed, his foot is laid on the ground. 

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:34.336
 Unlike Ajax, whose pitch is raised only subtly, so a little light can be seen beneath it. 

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:39.410
 Which means that his foot is moving, his muscles are tense, and his whole body. 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.701
 He is also slightly more inclined than Achilles, his head is slightly lower than his friend. 

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:50.408
 It seems to have some other meaning, you get stuck here except the game itself. 

00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:56.749
 Anyone in the ancient world whose eyes would have this amphora, knew the story of Achilles and Ajax, which Homer tells. 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:01.203
 What he said, Achilles is a great hero. 

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:08.206
 In fact, as a child, his mother dipped him into the river, which would make him invulnerable. 

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:12.933
 But she held him to his heel, so she remained unprotected. 

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:17.101
 And after all, he was killed by an arrow that hit him right there. 

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:23.270
 From there comes the expression "Achilles heel", which means "someone's weak spot". 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.002
 However, Achilles dies as a great hero. 

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.504
 But Ajax's fate is a bit more complicated. 

00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:33.376
 He will outlast Achilles and will take his body away from the battlefield. 

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:37.544
 Later he will take part in a battle for Achilles' armor. 

00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:43.694
 Achilles has many special doses, forged by god Hephaestus, the patron of the fire. 

00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:49.906
 Two want these armor, and both speak in an attempt to persuade the judges to give them. 

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:56.659
 Although Ajax was closer to Achilles, the armor was given to another. Death and hatred, Ajax kills a flock of sheep, 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.081
 until he finally committed suicide with his own sword - disgraced at the end of his life. 

00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:08.102
 So it's very interesting to look through the eyes of a casual observer from Ancient Ellada who knows the whole story 

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:11.169
 and everything that will happen to the two characters. 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:16.703
 But the story is one, and the way Ekeky, the Vasopisist, has presented this moment, 

00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:24.343
 these two figures, with so much regency, with such fine details on the surface of the amphora, 

00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:26.970
 which is so elegant, is something completely different. 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.467
 Eckey was really one of the greatest masters of black-figure style. 

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:39.739
 These black figures are silhouettes, and if you look closely you will notice that the decorative shapes are mostly painted with a needle. 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:43.704
 And the black surface is similar to paint, but not exactly. 

00:04:43.704 --> 00:04:53.505
 This is a "slip-wear". The ancient Hellenes did not know how to make ceramics ovens hot enough to turn it into glass as modern ceramics. 

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:58.936
 Instead, they took fine pieces of clay, immersed in water 

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:03.505
 and used them as a kind of paint. Depending on how much oxygen they have in the furnace, 

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:08.801
 the clay had a black or red color. They stained the surface with this and then 

00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:13.197
 she polished her. This was done with the help of a very smooth surface, such as the back of the spoon, 

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:20.604
 which rubbed back and forth to get this sleek and smooth effect. 

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:27.771
 If you look at the decoration on the handles or the one over the heroes, 

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:32.709
 there are beautiful details that are almost three-dimensional. 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:36.272
 The decoration is raised in places to capture the light. 

00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:41.168
 Greeks often embellished the amphora, 

00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:45.711
 as we decorate cakes today. 

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:51.700
 Just as the icing and cream are thrown over the surface of the cake, 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.637
 but in a much finer way, we see it here. 

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:59.437
 So Eckechi is a master whose works are so different in many ways, 

00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:04.142
 through their form, drawing, details, even the drama, 

00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:05.802
 which he has managed to give to the image. 

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:10.669
 The Etruscan tribes certainly believed that because they had to spend a lot of money, 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:17.210
 to transport this amphora from Greece, across the Mediterranean Sea to the Italian Peninsula where they lived. 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.499
 You know, in fact, many of the Amphorae of Dravna Ellada were actually buried in Etruscan tombs. 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:28.011
 The ancient Hellenes have routed an incredible business to export such amphoryl 

00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:30.567
 Ekeky was one of the greatest masters.
