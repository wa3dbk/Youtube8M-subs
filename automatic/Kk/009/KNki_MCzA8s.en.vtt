something<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.490> said<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> doubt<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
something I said is that I doubt that

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.210 
something I said is that I doubt that
they<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.170> another<00:00:19.439> voting<00:00:19.859> system

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they would have another voting system

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.730 
they would have another voting system
for<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.760> two<00:00:20.939> new<00:00:21.180> platforms<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
for the two new platforms I would I

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.439 
for the two new platforms I would I
assumes<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.150> cameras

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
assumes that because the two cameras

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
assumes that because the two cameras
actually<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.109> cyborg<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.800> dragon

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
actually one with cyborg and dragon

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.130 
actually one with cyborg and dragon
those<00:00:26.849> cameras<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.390> now<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> game<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
those cameras are now in the game in the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.429 
those cameras are now in the game in the
xbox<00:00:28.289> 360<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.189> black<00:00:29.400> ops<00:00:29.429> 2<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.750> doubted

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
xbox 360 of black ops 2 and I doubted

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.080 
xbox 360 of black ops 2 and I doubted
that<00:00:31.710> they<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.070> run<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> whole<00:00:32.640> new<00:00:32.850> voting

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that they would run a whole new voting

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.580 
that they would run a whole new voting
system<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.840> thought<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.170> would<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.350> put

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
system I thought they would just put

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.979 
system I thought they would just put
those<00:00:34.680> two<00:00:34.890> cameras<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.969> ps3<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.600> PC

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
those two cameras in the ps3 and the PC

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.420 
those two cameras in the ps3 and the PC
platforms<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> turns<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.250> they're

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
platforms but it turns out they're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.549 
platforms but it turns out they're
actually<00:00:38.700> having<00:00:38.820> another<00:00:39.180> voting<00:00:39.660> system<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
actually having another voting system so

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.410 
actually having another voting system so
this<00:00:41.129> gives<00:00:41.309> us<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> opportunity<00:00:41.730> for

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this gives us the opportunity for

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
this gives us the opportunity for
different<00:00:42.989> cameras<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.829> actual

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
different cameras if the actual

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
different cameras if the actual
community<00:00:44.640> decides<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.660> vote<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:45.840> something

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
community decides to vote for something

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
community decides to vote for something
different<00:00:46.559> than<00:00:46.980> cyborg<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> dragon<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.570> we

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
different than cyborg and dragon then we

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
different than cyborg and dragon then we
could<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:48.870> some<00:00:48.989> move<00:00:49.260> their<00:00:49.500> new<00:00:49.680> camos<00:00:50.039> on

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
