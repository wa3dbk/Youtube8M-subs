what is the challenge of opening weekend

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.930 
what is the challenge of opening weekend
well<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.469> think<00:00:13.860> there<00:00:14.040> are<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.160> lot<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.340> talent

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
well I think there are a lot of talent

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.990 
well I think there are a lot of talent
so<00:00:15.389> many<00:00:15.630> variables<00:00:16.260> Amanda<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.400> think

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
so many variables Amanda that I think

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.090 
so many variables Amanda that I think
are<00:00:18.150> out<00:00:18.359> there<00:00:18.630> especially<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> opener

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
are out there especially for the opener

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
are out there especially for the opener
I<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> coaches<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.689> concerned

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
I think the coaches are concerned

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
I think the coaches are concerned
they've<00:00:22.650> got<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:23.039> long<00:00:23.340> texts<00:00:23.850> left<00:00:24.060> they

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
they've got these long texts left they

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.700 
they've got these long texts left they
want<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:24.900> sure<00:00:24.930> they<00:00:25.199> covered

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
want to make sure they covered

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.429 
want to make sure they covered
everything<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.939> players<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.630> excited<00:00:27.810> they

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
everything the players are excited they

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
everything the players are excited they
want<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
want to get out there and get on the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.840 
want to get out there and get on the
field<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.320> color<00:00:31.529> jersey<00:00:32.160> but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
field with a different color jersey but

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.850 
field with a different color jersey but
I<00:00:32.910> think<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> big<00:00:33.989> adjustment<00:00:34.170> for

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
I think that was a big adjustment for

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.510 
I think that was a big adjustment for
everyone<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> clock<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
everyone is the clock and I think that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.430 
everyone is the clock and I think that
you're<00:00:38.790> used<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.540> spring<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you're used to going out spring and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
you're used to going out spring and
practicing<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> couple<00:00:41.640> hours<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> go

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
practicing for a couple hours and you go

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110 
practicing for a couple hours and you go
and<00:00:42.690> August<00:00:43.350> practice<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.980> attractive<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.879> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and August practice is attractive for a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
and August practice is attractive for a
couple<00:00:45.690> hours<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> sudden<00:00:46.950> you've

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
couple hours and all of a sudden you've

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
couple hours and all of a sudden you've
got<00:00:47.399> 60<00:00:48.000> minutes<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.719> you've<00:00:48.809> been<00:00:48.989> shooting

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
got 60 minutes that you've been shooting

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.950 
got 60 minutes that you've been shooting
for<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.579> earth<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.629> myth

during<00:00:52.500> sometimes<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.309> surprise<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.539> i

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
during sometimes the surprise those I i

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.260 
during sometimes the surprise those I i
think<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.649> game<00:00:55.860> two<00:00:56.160> years<00:00:56.460> ago<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> great

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
think our game two years ago is a great

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.110 
think our game two years ago is a great
example<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:58.020> over<00:00:58.379> Marshall<00:00:58.920> where<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> think

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
example that over Marshall where I think

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
example that over Marshall where I think
the<00:01:00.239> players<00:01:00.510> shop<00:01:01.109> realize<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.160> all

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the players shop realize it was all

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.240 
the players shop realize it was all
ranked<00:01:02.609> fourth<00:01:03.030> quarter<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.129> Marshall<00:01:05.129> was

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
ranked fourth quarter and Marshall was

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
ranked fourth quarter and Marshall was
played<00:01:05.489> great<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:06.060> got<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> fast

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
played great they got off to a fast

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.590 
played great they got off to a fast
start<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.650> were<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> come<00:01:09.570> up

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
start you were up and we had to come up

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
start you were up and we had to come up
with<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> couple<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.409> less<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> drive<00:01:11.369> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
with a couple of less and a drive in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
with a couple of less and a drive in
order<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> win<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> game<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
order to win that game so I think it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
order to win that game so I think it
used<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.280> clock<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> opener<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
used that clock in the opener is one of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
used that clock in the opener is one of
the<00:01:15.750> key<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.259> definitely<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the key thing definitely now we know the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
the key thing definitely now we know the
offensive<00:01:18.390> threats<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.140> wvu<00:01:20.040> but

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
offensive threats for wvu but

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
offensive threats for wvu but
defensively<00:01:21.000> how<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.960> things<00:01:21.990> playing

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
defensively how you see things playing

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.039 
defensively how you see things playing
out<00:01:22.820> well<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> be

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
out well that's that's going to be

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.530 
out well that's that's going to be
interesting<00:01:25.170> question<00:01:26.009> too<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.700> with

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
interesting question too because with

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
interesting question too because with
the<00:01:27.689> new<00:01:27.869> defensive<00:01:28.470> fact<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.310> course<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the new defensive fact we of course the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.390 
the new defensive fact we of course the
past<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.270> years<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.900> graduation<00:01:31.500> losses<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
past two years of graduation losses that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760 
past two years of graduation losses that
are<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:33.150> substantial<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.380> could<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.590> an

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
are pretty substantial so it could be an

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.340 
are pretty substantial so it could be an
opportunity<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.520> some<00:01:35.939> younger<00:01:36.299> guys<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
opportunity for some younger guys to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.890 
opportunity for some younger guys to
play<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.710> defense<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:39.180> we're<00:01:39.390> open<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
play on defense I think we're open the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.260 
play on defense I think we're open the
slack<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.590> taken<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.130> by<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> office<00:01:42.000> with
