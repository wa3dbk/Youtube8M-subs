00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
a few times you will get it because it's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.300 
a few times you will get it because it's
not<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.930> hard<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.620> give<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.100> spin

have to perform the Charlie health to
catch<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.000> card<00:03:42.209> in<00:03:43.109> between<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.160> two

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
catch the card in between the two

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.100 
catch the card in between the two
selections<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:45.989> will<00:03:46.290> try<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.560> in

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
selections so I will try it in

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.950 
selections so I will try it in
time<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.560> don't<00:03:47.710> know<00:03:47.800> if<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:47.980> get<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.960> yeah

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
time I don't know if I get it but yeah

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.580 
time I don't know if I get it but yeah
you<00:03:50.080> get<00:03:50.290> it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
you get it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.770 
you get it
so<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.070> just<00:03:51.250> can't<00:03:51.550> it<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.940> at<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.450> end<00:03:52.660> of

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
so you just can't it and at the end of

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.510 
so you just can't it and at the end of
the<00:03:52.870> trick<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.530> just<00:03:53.770> have<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:53.950> spread<00:03:54.340> the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
the trick you just have to spread the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.940 
the trick you just have to spread the
cards<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.090> take<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.990> count<00:03:56.500> underneath

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
cards and you take the count underneath

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.130 
cards and you take the count underneath
and<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.220> card<00:03:57.430> about<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.850> five<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.240> Hearts<00:03:58.570> to

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
and the card about the five of Hearts to

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.710 
and the card about the five of Hearts to
reveal<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.590> DFL<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.700> five<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.210> spades<00:04:01.300> at<00:04:01.630> the

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
reveal the DFL the five of spades at the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.510 
reveal the DFL the five of spades at the
nine<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.020> Spades<00:04:02.320> which<00:04:02.530> are<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.310> two

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
nine of Spades which are the two

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.440 
nine of Spades which are the two
selectively<00:04:04.450> counts<00:04:05.490> so<00:04:06.490> I<00:04:06.520> know<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:07.120> sounds<00:04:07.390> a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
selectively counts so I know it sounds a

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.600 
selectively counts so I know it sounds a
little<00:04:07.570> bit<00:04:07.750> complicated<00:04:07.990> but<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.010> just<00:04:09.430> have

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
little bit complicated but you just have

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.790 
little bit complicated but you just have
to<00:04:09.760> practice<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.420> spin<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.900> card<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.380> front<00:04:11.650> of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
to practice to spin the card in front of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.210 
to practice to spin the card in front of
you

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.060 
you
okay<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.330> just<00:04:13.630> dropped<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.380> but<00:04:14.530> it's<00:04:14.890> not<00:04:15.040> a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
okay so I just dropped it but it's not a

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.520 
okay so I just dropped it but it's not a
problem<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.940> just<00:04:16.150> pin<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:16.750> just

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
problem you just pin it and then just

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.250 
problem you just pin it and then just
perform<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.890> Charlier<00:04:18.280> cut<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.850> catch<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.269> in

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
perform a Charlier cut to catch it in

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.190 
perform a Charlier cut to catch it in
between<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.859> two<00:04:20.980> selections<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.570> basically

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
between the two selections so basically

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.840 
between the two selections so basically
the<00:04:23.350> trick<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.830> hope<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.370> enjoy<00:04:24.640> them

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
the trick I hope you enjoy them

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.700 
the trick I hope you enjoy them
it<00:04:24.970> needs<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.270> little<00:04:25.419> bit<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.720> practice<00:04:25.990> but<00:04:26.680> I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
it needs a little bit of practice but I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.610 
it needs a little bit of practice but I
think<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.490> will<00:04:27.640> gotta<00:04:27.910> get<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.630> that<00:04:29.380> says

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
think you will gotta get it so that says

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.850 
think you will gotta get it so that says
is<00:04:30.340> in<00:04:30.520> acts<00:04:30.669> now
