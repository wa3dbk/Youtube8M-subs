00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.180
 at 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.160
 hi both of a witness that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.960
 I hope you will of course 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.640
 than today for the former number 3 of 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.450
 vaylats get lost on the run we are 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.310
 always with this australia team 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.690
 add some small contracts and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.850
 in the previous episode could not have 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.470
 already changed two nations so we're going 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.390
 I still hope to succeed in changing 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.430
 nation live from this episode 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.340
 so I remind you of every division 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.020
 we change countries and do not go out 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 prime nation it's good stop me 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.800
 too ugly enough now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 yeah so here we are always with 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.160
 rich australia and dubuc music 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.840
 and put express people I want 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.399
 to say that I think it may well 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.070
 start I think it's possible 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.480
 that I look at it is villa that accelerates 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.620
 what makes us nice that has 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 kept the ball we do not know too much 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.899
 how 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.910
 what will do here roulette 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.379
 we have the shock hits the right foot 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.059
 it's inside that's how it's 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.760
 start that's how we start 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.769
 vela who I have not frozen a little lost I 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.510
 find a little lost the thread on carlos 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.879
 I think it's not huge here 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.110
 casually for one for a thot player 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.970
 I am really disappointed with the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.490
 scorer version frankly so good 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.390
 it does not matter too bad and bashe had 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.260
 there he will continue to put the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.520
 pressure with regard to lay people and he 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.490
 happens going to equal I'm recovering and that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 vela and fucking I do not know how 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.430
 I can not score first 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.619
 I'm lucky there is the ideology this 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.479
 who follows so that's in the 8th minute 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.810
 already 2 0 that's how it starts 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.549
 wheelchair here who with rake shots 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.369
 pierce the whole defense he goes 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.869
 succeed in centering at the far post after 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.820
 another leader one last one 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.220
 last feint hit the roulette wheel and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.360
 there the small recovery of ramsey who 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.729
 is definitely one of the players I have 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.619
 most liked in this team 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.570
 from australia he was really great 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.860
 for a good jetro player too kiffÃ© and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.600
 I really advise you to test it 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 there my work in wilshere that made 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.810
 almost all the terrain before 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.610
 let go of this record for ramsey it was 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.170
 maybe a little near a disgusting goal 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.600
 but hey it's okay 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.430
 and there I catch up the trinquet not 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.289
 of worry the long shot of tim cahill it 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.180
 goes well it goes very very well 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.009
 and here is how it works 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.939
 that's how it works too 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.399
 while I have a little bit of time 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.110
 I wanted to tell you that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.909
 there I soon leave kind three 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 four days in a festival and all that 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.390
 so I do not think I'll have time 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.489
 to make videos super way 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.780
 regular good how are you doing 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.549
 this way that I send cities to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 minus five videos a week so I 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.180
 think at least four videos a week 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.400
 by so I think you like you will have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 two weeks in July where there will be 3 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.390
 2 3 4 videos to fart 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.439
 and so I had to tell myself 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.379
 continue to put pressure on them 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.329
 look again is thompson 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.560
 var and and that one stopped had to stop 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.470
 put goals by what this is it 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.090
 do not it's archi thompson that we 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.440
 puts an archi strikes 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.569
 I want to say word games of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.190
 the grass it releases so we'll see that at 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.959
 slow motion up the keystroke 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.030
 she goes down well the guardian who is 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.500
 lost and we are still waiting for the rush 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.540
 leaves are still expected expected 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.980
 always rams and who center there we want 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.769
 boost a little calving stages c 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.900
 is there but you kill you kill him the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.250
 is burning must burn so 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840
 good ben abdellah frankly I lost 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.340
 the yarn 1 jari more noticed the coup I 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.790
 force with him and suddenly not and that's 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.859
 even worse 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.260
 and here you go quickly to the side 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.400
 left unfortunately it's missed and the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.349
 corner to see what we can do is 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.780
 wilshere who looks after it and the head of 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.400
 the inevitable davidson who was a very 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.750
 good defender I really liked 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.769
 years I was not expecting such a good 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.239
 defender because I was a little 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.519
 skeptical about attributes 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.750
 defensive means and offensive to and 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.250
 frankly it's not bad it's not 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.239
 badly beautiful little curled hit of 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.010
 zych videos fortunately it's a 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.389
 keeper a good if not with a guardian no 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.099
 would the money the type they 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.019
 stopped it that these cui and basel 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.090
 once again a goal of tim cahill 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.470
 that's who with his big 91 in the lead 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.199
 he was really a very good tim player 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.879
 cahill and so here we go to 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.079
 yeah I did not say I did not say what 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.940
 nation I have not yet said which nation 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.280
 massive exposed the attentions fate 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.280
 and censorship we must censor 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.199
 so here it is good we are champion of 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.930
 division 5 quietly bah voila I 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:57.359
 still well dominated 28 shots at 6 and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.650
 here is champion that's done and we're going 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.940
 see his shares he first I'll go to you 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.769
 show the players that I decided to 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.909
 keep for the final team you know I 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.109
 think I 'll win it at the end 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.479
 with carlos vela I want to keep three 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.310
 players speak by country so I'm going 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.680
 start with yann rams and tim cahill 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.569
 and davidson this is the three 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.709
 players I'm going to keep ram it's 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.900
 that there are four stars cahill the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.389
 strapless version 91 in the lead and the last 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.200
 this is davidson is here so we go to 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.400
 Japan 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.790
 Let's go to Japan 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.780
 quietly and that's listened to I 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.130
 want to show the team right away so 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.660
 that's the team I did not 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.370
 two central defenders and so suddenly 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.240
 I had to put a right defender a 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.820
 central defender 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.840
 so it's the most complete team that 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.660
 I could do with the credits that 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.210
 I had because I would have taken by 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.890
 example yoshida boost or so still a 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.170
 sail actually I believe to cubic 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.550
 I could have taken loose but 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.590
 good here it was a bit expensive so the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.250
 suddenly I could have written yes I have left 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.870
 7,193,794 same and let's go on 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.240
 start right now the first game 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.580
 with my Japanese team against a 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.000
 nice series team has in 4-3-1-2 with 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.380
 armero with dock ligny not the 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.390
 port wharf zag leopard had to 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.250
 balotelli of edinson cavani which should 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.050
 sign in psg I do not know we'll see 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.100
 what that gives and on bass and kagawa 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.930
 who finds himself alone in front of the goalkeeper 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.800
 little ball to the ground unfortunately 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.090
 please but vela who had 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.350
 followed and I do not know why he tried 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.310
 that but be careful it's not over 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.010
 city recovery at the keystroke 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.380
 rescuing his guardian a beautiful 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.340
 clapper the beautiful clapper reflex on 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.460
 will see what the corner can give 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.260
 it is he who takes care of the head and 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.820
 unfortunately still interned moaning on 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.650
 may be able to put this 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.940
 Once I decided to shoot a 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.710
 good free kick shooter who is honda 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.120
 who is a very good player that I 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.510
 advise because it's cheap the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.090
 head 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.010
 the recovery is happening right next to it 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.700
 a lot beside it's a shame but good 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.720
 it is not serious 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.340
 the help we continue to put 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.330
 6th minute pressure acceleration world has 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.270
 looked at the post she's perfect for 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.890
 yoshi and ben ali who in two stages in 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.000
 two beats of course but who succeeds in 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.100
 mark the 9th minute 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.960
 this goal that makes us feel good since we 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.940
 open the brand and take advantage 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.620
 decisive because it's still a 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.850
 big team so we 're not immune 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.260
 of a dumpling knowing that my 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.440
 defense besides there is not really any 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.690
 true true business advocates what the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.710
 most ceded sideways so we're going 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.540
 see what we can do and especially 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.160
 better pitch is not very defensive 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.100
 so you have to quickly mark for 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.990
 then build that we go on 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.820
 serene bases we'll say here and there it's 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.430
 the counterattack with inui that goes into 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.380
 depth for kagawa and kagawa he can 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.730
 do not miss it look at the left foot the 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.210
