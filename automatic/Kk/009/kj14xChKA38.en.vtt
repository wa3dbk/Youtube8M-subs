with with the LW a well the LW a is a
fantastic<00:00:18.930> new<00:00:19.350> amplifier<00:00:19.949> from<00:00:20.160> warwick<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
fantastic new amplifier from warwick and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.720 
fantastic new amplifier from warwick and
it<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> lightweight<00:00:22.680> amplifier<00:00:23.310> its<00:00:23.460> Class

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
it is a lightweight amplifier its Class

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.080 
it is a lightweight amplifier its Class
D<00:00:23.760> technology<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.769> only<00:00:25.890> weighs<00:00:26.130> 5.7

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
D technology so it only weighs 5.7

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630 
D technology so it only weighs 5.7
pounds<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.810> generates<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.500> legit<00:00:29.010> thousand

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
pounds but it generates a legit thousand

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.970 
pounds but it generates a legit thousand
watts<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.179> 4<00:00:30.449> ohms<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> real<00:00:31.769> special

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
watts at 4 ohms it has a real special

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
watts at 4 ohms it has a real special
power<00:00:32.640> module<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:33.690> how<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
power module in it and that's how it

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.930 
power module in it and that's how it
does<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> Pascal<00:00:35.670> power

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
does it it's a it's a Pascal power

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.990 
does it it's a it's a Pascal power
module<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.649> puts<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> thousand<00:00:38.850> watts

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
module and it puts out a thousand watts

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.660 
module and it puts out a thousand watts
at<00:00:39.239> less<00:00:39.600> than<00:00:39.629> 1%<00:00:40.050> THD<00:00:41.010> total<00:00:41.399> harmonic

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
at less than 1% THD total harmonic

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.150 
at less than 1% THD total harmonic
distortion<00:00:42.110> what<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.290> means<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.070> know

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
distortion what that means you know

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.709 
distortion what that means you know
that's<00:00:44.370> technical<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> really

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that's technical but what it really

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.479 
that's technical but what it really
means<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> delivers<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> booty<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
means is it delivers the booty it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.119 
means is it delivers the booty it
delivers<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.940> low-end<00:00:48.600> fundamental<00:00:49.440> real

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
delivers the low-end fundamental real

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
delivers the low-end fundamental real
fast<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.760> real<00:00:51.000> clean<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> lot<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
fast in real clean with a lot of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
fast in real clean with a lot of
headroom<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:53.460> no<00:00:53.610> distortion<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.329> no

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
headroom and there's no distortion or no

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
headroom and there's no distortion or no
clipping<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
clipping so that's what kind of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240 
clipping so that's what kind of
differentiates<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.420> other<00:00:58.250> lightweight

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
differentiates it from other lightweight

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
differentiates it from other lightweight
amplifiers<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.270> come<00:01:00.449> before<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.960> cool

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
amplifiers that have come before it cool

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
amplifiers that have come before it cool
and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> channel<00:01:02.699> switching<00:01:03.030> at

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and I see it's a channel switching at

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.810 
and I see it's a channel switching at
YouTube<00:01:03.600> channels<00:01:03.930> yeah<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
YouTube channels yeah that's one of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.219 
YouTube channels yeah that's one of the
one<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> great<00:01:06.450> features<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.140> have

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
one of the great features of you have

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
one of the great features of you have
two<00:01:07.380> completely<00:01:07.770> independent<00:01:08.040> channels<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
two completely independent channels that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
two completely independent channels that
are<00:01:08.909> identical<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:11.070> switch

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
are identical and then you can switch

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.130 
are identical and then you can switch
between<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.970> two<00:01:12.000> channels<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> comes

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
between the two channels and it comes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.330 
between the two channels and it comes
with<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> foot<00:01:13.590> switch<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.070> comes<00:01:14.250> with

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
with the foot switch and it comes with

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.960 
with the foot switch and it comes with
the<00:01:14.700> TRS<00:01:15.479> cable<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.320> I'll<00:01:16.740> play<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> second

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the TRS cable so I'll play for a second

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:30.260 
the TRS cable so I'll play for a second
here<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> demonstrate<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
here just to demonstrate so what I have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
here just to demonstrate so what I have
is<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.689> two<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.320> EQ<00:01:31.619> structures

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
is I have two different EQ structures

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
is I have two different EQ structures
I'm<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.820> top<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.930> ramped

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
I'm the top one I have kind of a ramped

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.130 
I'm the top one I have kind of a ramped
up<00:01:34.799> low<00:01:35.220> end<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.759> some<00:01:36.390> sizzle<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> high

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
up low end and some sizzle and the high

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
up low end and some sizzle and the high
end<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.430> channel<00:01:38.820> i<00:01:38.880> have

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
end and then on the other channel i have

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.690 
end and then on the other channel i have
it<00:01:39.180> set<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> enhanced<00:01:40.439> mid-range<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it set with the enhanced mid-range so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
it set with the enhanced mid-range so
for<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> bass<00:01:42.180> player<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.689> using<00:01:43.020> two

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
for a bass player that's using two

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
for a bass player that's using two
different<00:01:43.470> sound<00:01:43.710> settings<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.759> switch

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
different sound settings they can switch

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.289 
different sound settings they can switch
between<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.509> two<00:01:45.540> say<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.350> play<00:01:47.180> fretted<00:01:48.180> on

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
between the two say you play fretted on

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.850 
between the two say you play fretted on
most<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> set<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.229> play<00:01:49.470> fretless

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
most of the set but you play fretless

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.039 
most of the set but you play fretless
bass<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.310> three<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.610> four<00:01:50.759> songs<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.840> can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
bass on three or four songs you can

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.569 
bass on three or four songs you can
switch<00:01:52.350> between<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.799> two<00:01:52.829> instruments<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
switch between the two instruments and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.980 
switch between the two instruments and
have<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:53.939> different<00:01:54.270> sound<00:01:54.509> settings

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have your two different sound settings
