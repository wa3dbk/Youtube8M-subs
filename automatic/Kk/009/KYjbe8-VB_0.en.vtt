overall<00:00:56.760> players<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.870> bench<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> then

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
overall players on the bench and then

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
overall players on the bench and then
they<00:00:58.500> pause<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> screen<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.550> we'll<00:00:59.820> probably

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
they pause the screen so we'll probably

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
they pause the screen so we'll probably
have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> deal<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.829> okay

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
have to deal with that but that's okay

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709 
have to deal with that but that's okay
that's<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.550> part<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> game<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> guess

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that's as part of the the game I guess
