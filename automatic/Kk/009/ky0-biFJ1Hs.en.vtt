on<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.550> gun<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.970> actually<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:22.199> weird

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
on this gun it's actually really weird

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.939 
on this gun it's actually really weird
this<00:00:24.390> kinda<00:00:24.630> has<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> lot<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:24.990> recoil<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.800> at

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this kinda has a lot of recoil but at

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
this kinda has a lot of recoil but at
the<00:00:26.070> same<00:00:26.250> time<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.240> don't<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> use

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the same time I really don't like to use

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
the same time I really don't like to use
grip<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.410> lot<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> people<00:00:28.920> say<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.429> grip

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
grip on it a lot of people say that grip

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.120 
grip on it a lot of people say that grip
doesn't<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:30.779> affect<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.560> weapon<00:00:31.890> I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
doesn't actually affect the weapon I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.020 
doesn't actually affect the weapon I
don't<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.399> I've<00:00:32.520> been<00:00:32.550> hearing<00:00:32.880> things

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
don't know I've been hearing things

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
don't know I've been hearing things
about<00:00:33.300> people<00:00:34.140> saying<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.710> grip<00:00:34.980> doesn't

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
about people saying a grip doesn't

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.270 
about people saying a grip doesn't
actually<00:00:35.520> affect<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> weapon<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> like

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
actually affect the weapon and like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.530 
actually affect the weapon and like
apparently<00:00:38.280> drifter<00:00:38.730> made<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> video<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
apparently drifter made a video about I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
apparently drifter made a video about I
don't<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> research<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.070> about

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
don't know I have to research more about

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.069 
don't know I have to research more about
it<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.000> apparently<00:00:42.120> grip<00:00:42.690> doesn't<00:00:42.960> really

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it but apparently grip doesn't really

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
it but apparently grip doesn't really
help<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> tried<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> Scorpion

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
help so I tried using the Scorpion

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
help so I tried using the Scorpion
without<00:00:45.450> grip<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.020> tried<00:00:46.260> silencer<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
without grip and I tried silencer and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.529 
without grip and I tried silencer and
fast<00:00:47.070> mag<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.879> love<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> set<00:00:48.420> up

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
fast mag and I really love this set up

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.240 
fast mag and I really love this set up
on<00:00:48.660> scorpion<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.649> cuz<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> really

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
on scorpion just cuz that's a really

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
on scorpion just cuz that's a really
fast<00:00:50.610> fire<00:00:51.090> rate<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> recoil

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
fast fire rate and I has a lot of recoil

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200 
fast fire rate and I has a lot of recoil
but<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.280> recoil<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.789> definitely

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
but that recoil is definitely

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
but that recoil is definitely
controllable<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.649> need<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
controllable so you don't really need a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.389 
controllable so you don't really need a
grip<00:00:56.309> even<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.899> grip<00:00:58.079> should<00:00:58.739> work<00:00:59.039> but

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
grip even when the grip should work but

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.380 
grip even when the grip should work but
uh<00:00:59.870> you<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.199> need<00:01:01.440> grip<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> fast

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
uh you don't really need grip and fast

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
uh you don't really need grip and fast
mag<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.320> good<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
mag is really good on this because the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
mag is really good on this because the
fire<00:01:05.790> rate<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.240> fast<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> clip<00:01:06.930> drains

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
fire rate is so fast the clip drains

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
fire rate is so fast the clip drains
pretty<00:01:07.619> quickly<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:09.030> once<00:01:09.780> your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
pretty quickly so that way once your

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
pretty quickly so that way once your
ammo<00:01:11.040> runs<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.760> quickly<00:01:12.000> reload

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
ammo runs out you just quickly reload

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
ammo runs out you just quickly reload
with<00:01:12.600> fast<00:01:12.869> mag<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
with fast mag and I really like it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
with fast mag and I really like it
especially<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.700> silencer<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.360> really

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
especially with silencer it's really

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.749 
especially with silencer it's really
good<00:01:15.720> setup<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.140> definitely<00:01:16.409> suggest<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.610> guys

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
good setup I definitely suggest you guys

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.510 
good setup I definitely suggest you guys
to<00:01:18.150> try<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> use<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> um<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:20.220> some<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to try and use this um I know on some of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
to try and use this um I know on some of
the<00:01:20.610> bigger<00:01:20.759> maps<00:01:21.000> Matt<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.990> gun<00:01:22.170> might<00:01:22.409> not

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the bigger maps Matt this gun might not

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.289 
the bigger maps Matt this gun might not
be<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> best<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> recoil<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.090> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
be the best because of the recoil but I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
be the best because of the recoil but I
really<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> weapon<00:01:25.799> especially<00:01:25.979> on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really do like this weapon especially on

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.179 
really do like this weapon especially on
Yemen<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.299> good<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:28.409> basically

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
