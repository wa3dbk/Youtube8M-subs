tricks on the side so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:48.660> started<00:00:48.750> hop<00:00:49.560> in<00:00:49.740> to<00:00:49.829> forge<00:00:50.070> mode<00:00:52.610> start

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
get started hop in to forge mode start

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.730 
get started hop in to forge mode start
off<00:00:53.730> by<00:00:53.910> spawning<00:00:54.240> a<00:00:54.420> container<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> turn<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
off by spawning a container and turn it

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.569 
off by spawning a container and turn it
sideways<00:00:56.780> then<00:00:57.780> take<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.620> barriers<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
sideways then take two barriers and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.500 
sideways then take two barriers and
place<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.480> side<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.160> container<00:01:02.520> make

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
place them in side of the container make

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.350 
place them in side of the container make
sure<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.780> container<00:01:04.079> is<00:01:04.290> sideways<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.360> for

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
sure the container is sideways and for

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.569 
sure the container is sideways and for
the<00:01:06.420> best<00:01:06.600> effect<00:01:06.990> put<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> barriers<00:01:07.799> side

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
the best effect put the barriers side

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.999 
the best effect put the barriers side
way<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.119> easier<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> stand<00:01:09.780> inside<00:01:13.009> then

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
way so it's easier to stand inside then

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.950 
way so it's easier to stand inside then
place<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> couple<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.909> gravel<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.299> conveniently

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
place a couple of gravel is conveniently

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.959 
place a couple of gravel is conveniently
near<00:01:16.139> the<00:01:16.259> container<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> grab<00:01:17.399> all

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
near the container for you to grab all

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.919 
near the container for you to grab all

this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:26.939> dangerous<00:01:27.119> stunt<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.840> not

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this is a very dangerous stunt do not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.830 
this is a very dangerous stunt do not
try<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.380> home

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.480 

oh<00:01:38.969> you<00:01:39.969> know<00:01:40.119> I've<00:01:41.079> always<00:01:41.320> kind<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.280> wondered

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
ah no one of the cool neat tricks I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.860 
ah no one of the cool neat tricks I
noticed<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.680> sometimes<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:19.090> box<00:02:19.540> just

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
noticed that sometimes the box just

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.290 
noticed that sometimes the box just
floats<00:02:20.200> up<00:02:20.440> there<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.550> gravel<00:02:21.910> if<00:02:22.000> holds

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
floats up there and the gravel if holds

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.270 
floats up there and the gravel if holds
it<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.480> for<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> good<00:02:22.900> amount<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.200> time<00:02:23.380> oh<00:02:23.650> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
it up for a good amount of time oh and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.340 
it up for a good amount of time oh and
one<00:02:24.430> more<00:02:24.460> tip<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:25.270> not<00:02:25.450> shoot<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.690> box<00:02:26.020> it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
one more tip do not shoot the box it

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.710 
one more tip do not shoot the box it
will<00:02:26.860> fall<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.480> will<00:02:31.630> not<00:02:31.840> feel<00:02:32.410> good<00:02:32.680> i

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
