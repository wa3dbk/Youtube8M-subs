00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.540
 solar energy is becoming increasingly popular as an energy source 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 houses 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.709
 there are different solar boiler systems 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.230
 in this instructional film follow the connection of a hr to be filtered back 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.069
 solar solar boiler system for the bank branch water supply of the residents 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.160
 on this house in bodegraven for the old solar collectors from nineteen 93 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.780
 replaced by three new vortex disturbing of her there so long 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.070
 these are placed on the roof with a crane 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.880
 or this flat roof you mount the collectors on the flat roof supplied 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.840
 frames 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.740
 the collector gives the best return if it is oriented 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.480
 southeast and southwest 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.800
 from below a slope of 25 to 60 degrees 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.550
 five tiles per frame ensure proper anchoring of the frames on it 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.790
 roof 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.590
 connect the collector pipes names follow against lehman principle 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.110
 Insulate external pipes with suitable insulation that is short-lived 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.110
 must be able to withstand temperatures below 80 degrees 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.210
 the sensor also closes the council chamber and pass the pipes and wire through the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.210
 tractor for the horses in the attic are the solar water heater 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.920
 then the connection of the pipes to the existing one starts 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.030
 use 15 new meters of copper pipes for this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540
 far at the first old pump 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.610
 cut the pipe to a size to be able to connect the new pump unit 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 rig the pipe in the customized pump unit 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.360
 flat the bottom of the pump at the cold outlet of the collective 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 circuit from stock 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.939
 and the top on the cold times changed collector circuit 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.129
 five then firmly tighten all pipes 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.939
 hr soler's solar boiler system filled with the truck is an extra expansion tank 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.599
 required 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.269
 mount your first expansion vessel bracket at the correct height on the wall 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.919
 in order to connect it, you make these pieces and the branch 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.899
 of the cold water pipe 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.139
 ensure a watertight closure of the soft nature of the expansive ad 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.559
 by discovering this with biting around food 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.789
 a mounting expansion vessel then to the bracket 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.839
 then makes the pipe to size and closes the expansion vessel on the collector 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:56.419
 leadership 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.289
 if all pipes of the collecter's circuit are correctly installed 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.409
 isolated 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.979
 you fill the system with a water chemistry comment sell with a mixing ratio of two 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.159
 stands on one 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.459
 controlled mixing ratio with such a refractory meter 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.369
 the water must be between this minus 15 and in 18 degrees 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.489
 they find much comes on the volcano of the consumer and much in the system 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.630
 three stages in which you allow the liquid to flow back in between 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.249
 in the hole of the stuff 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:32.569
 this is how you ensure that this expansion vessel is automatically circulated around air 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:38.199
 if we no longer see any air bubbles visible in the emerging liquid, you feel 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.349
 the system to a real of the approximately 2 bar 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.979
 connect the sensor to the collectors' boards and the boards to it 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.249
 control clock of the control seal in the computer 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:54.069
 the system can now be operated by plugging it in 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.809
 plug in 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:01.369
 tell the customer that the solar water heater must remain in continuous operation and before 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.369
 good effect 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.909
 Yes
