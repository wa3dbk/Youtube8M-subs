probably going to die what's oh I'm
definitely<00:02:57.139> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> die<00:02:57.709> now

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.500 

a<00:03:01.040> matter<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.760> fact<00:03:01.970> let's<00:03:02.150> take<00:03:02.330> off<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
a matter of fact let's take off the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.880 
a matter of fact let's take off the
super<00:03:02.900> weapon<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.500> don't<00:03:03.530> lose<00:03:03.830> it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
super weapon just so I don't lose it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.820 
super weapon just so I don't lose it
when<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.190> inevitably<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.820> myself<00:03:05.060> killed<00:03:08.830> yeah

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
when I inevitably get myself killed yeah

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.640 
when I inevitably get myself killed yeah
that's<00:03:10.130> all<00:03:10.280> she<00:03:10.430> wrote<00:03:10.460> as<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:12.080> can<00:03:12.200> see<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
that's all she wrote as you can see the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.740 
that's all she wrote as you can see the
fire<00:03:13.070> weapon<00:03:13.460> has<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.640> much<00:03:13.910> bigger<00:03:14.180> hit<00:03:14.480> bux

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
fire weapon has a much bigger hit bux

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.350 
fire weapon has a much bigger hit bux
than<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.050> actual<00:03:15.260> fire<00:03:15.710> blast<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:17.150> can

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
than the actual fire blast and it can

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.000 
than the actual fire blast and it can
hit<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.960> fair<00:03:18.200> distance<00:03:18.470> vertically

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
hit you for a fair distance vertically

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.070 
hit you for a fair distance vertically
that's<00:03:19.640> why<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.850> say<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.150> have<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.480> be<00:03:20.570> really

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
that's why I say you have to be really

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.570 
that's why I say you have to be really
far<00:03:21.290> away<00:03:21.440> if<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.920> don't<00:03:22.070> want<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.250> be<00:03:22.310> head<00:03:22.460> by

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
far away if you don't want to be head by

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.800 
far away if you don't want to be head by
it<00:03:24.040> let's<00:03:25.040> try<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.550> again<00:03:28.630> bushman<00:03:29.630> we<00:03:29.720> have

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
it let's try that again bushman we have

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.930 
it let's try that again bushman we have
got<00:03:29.959> some<00:03:30.110> lives<00:03:30.320> in<00:03:30.470> reserve<00:03:30.800> so<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.700> won't

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
got some lives in reserve so I won't

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.180 
got some lives in reserve so I won't
have<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.120> continue<00:03:32.570> by<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.590> way<00:03:33.740> I<00:03:33.770> have<00:03:34.010> never

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
have to continue by the way I have never

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.010 
have to continue by the way I have never
seen<00:03:34.490> him<00:03:34.610> use<00:03:34.790> any<00:03:35.000> other<00:03:35.180> weapon<00:03:35.540> in

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
seen him use any other weapon in

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.630 
seen him use any other weapon in
addition<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.470> fire<00:03:36.650> besides<00:03:37.130> his<00:03:37.340> fast

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
addition to the fire besides his fast

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.670 
addition to the fire besides his fast
version<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.209> plasma<00:03:38.390> cannon<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.500> at<00:03:39.590> least

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
version of the plasma cannon so at least

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.720 
version of the plasma cannon so at least
you<00:03:39.830> don't<00:03:39.920> have<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.160> worry<00:03:40.340> about<00:03:40.459> him

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
you don't have to worry about him

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.070 
you don't have to worry about him
dropping<00:03:40.970> rocket<00:03:41.360> launches<00:03:41.690> or<00:03:41.780> anything

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
dropping rocket launches or anything

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.380 
dropping rocket launches or anything
like<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.000> imagine<00:03:44.150> this

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
like that on you I have to imagine this

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.150 
like that on you I have to imagine this
guy<00:03:44.540> would<00:03:44.720> be<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.840> total<00:03:45.440> nightmare<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:45.920> he<00:03:46.010> had

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
guy would be a total nightmare if he had

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
guy would be a total nightmare if he had
access<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.640> things<00:03:46.850> like<00:03:47.030> super<00:03:51.610> his<00:03:52.610> pattern

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
access to things like super his pattern

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.940 
access to things like super his pattern
he<00:03:53.360> roughly<00:03:53.750> follows<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.530> it's<00:03:54.650> kind<00:03:54.860> of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
he roughly follows you but it's kind of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.920 
he roughly follows you but it's kind of
erratic<00:03:55.220> sometimes<00:03:56.060> he<00:03:56.420> follows<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.810> with

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
erratic sometimes he follows you with

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.979 
erratic sometimes he follows you with
burners<00:03:57.290> sometimes<00:03:57.709> he<00:03:57.800> just<00:03:57.830> jumps<00:03:58.250> around

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
burners sometimes he just jumps around

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.600 
burners sometimes he just jumps around
so<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.709> kind<00:04:00.860> of<00:04:00.980> have<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.130> be<00:04:01.340> ready<00:04:01.489> for

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
so you just kind of have to be ready for

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.570 
so you just kind of have to be ready for
either<00:04:01.870> possibility<00:04:02.870> be<00:04:03.860> ready<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.220> jump<00:04:04.430> up

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
either possibility be ready to jump up

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.840 
either possibility be ready to jump up
or<00:04:04.730> down<00:04:04.910> at<00:04:05.450> any<00:04:05.660> moment<00:04:06.370> doing<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.519> little<00:04:07.670> bit

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
or down at any moment doing a little bit

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.340 
or down at any moment doing a little bit
of<00:04:07.880> this<00:04:08.090> time<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.540> hopefully<00:04:08.720> I'll<00:04:09.140> be<00:04:09.170> able

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
of this time so hopefully I'll be able

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.380 
of this time so hopefully I'll be able
to<00:04:09.530> endure<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.950> fire<00:04:10.160> because<00:04:11.120> again<00:04:11.360> I

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
to endure the fire because again I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.410 
to endure the fire because again I
