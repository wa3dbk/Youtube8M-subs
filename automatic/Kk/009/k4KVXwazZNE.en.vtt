00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
back and left backs i'm going to use

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.780 
back and left backs i'm going to use
drugs<00:00:30.570> chruch<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.440> the<00:00:31.530> example<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.580> you<00:00:32.669> just

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
drugs chruch for the example so you just

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.689 
drugs chruch for the example so you just
need<00:00:32.970> to<00:00:33.030> find<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.780> back<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.170> left<00:00:34.350> back

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
need to find the right back or left back

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.640 
need to find the right back or left back
check<00:00:35.699> their<00:00:35.879> minimum<00:00:36.150> by<00:00:36.449> now<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.900> think<00:00:37.140> he's

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
check their minimum by now I think he's

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.240 
check their minimum by now I think he's
gone<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.270> 1.4<00:00:39.270> k<00:00:39.449> roughly<00:00:39.989> oh<00:00:40.170> he's<00:00:41.070> got

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
gone for about 1.4 k roughly oh he's got

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
gone for about 1.4 k roughly oh he's got
cheaper<00:00:41.550> actually<00:00:41.909> he's<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.960> about

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cheaper actually he's going for about

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.070 
cheaper actually he's going for about
okay<00:00:43.970> this<00:00:44.970> method<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
okay this method you just really need to

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.229 
okay this method you just really need to
find<00:00:46.199> a<00:00:46.320> play<00:00:46.470> that<00:00:46.620> work<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.820> could<00:00:47.970> find

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
find a play that work so you could find

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
find a play that work so you could find
him<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> que<00:00:49.080> there<00:00:49.409> it<00:00:50.010> might<00:00:50.190> actually

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
him go for a que there it might actually

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.140 
him go for a que there it might actually
be<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.550> deal<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> he's<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.589> for<00:00:52.769> a<00:00:52.800> k<00:00:52.979> and<00:00:53.250> he

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
be a deal so he's going for a k and he

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.640 
be a deal so he's going for a k and he
is<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:56.030> right<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.479> much<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.930> him<00:00:58.080> so

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
is a right back so much as for him so

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.979 
is a right back so much as for him so
then<00:00:59.159> you<00:00:59.339> want<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.640> check<00:00:59.790> his<00:01:00.000> price<00:01:00.269> in<00:01:00.540> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
then you want to check his price in a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.490 
then you want to check his price in a
right<00:01:01.320> wing<00:01:01.559> back<00:01:02.390> where<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.170> wing

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
right wing back where is it right wing

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.550 
right wing back where is it right wing
back<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:06.120> should<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.510> 1.5<00:01:07.290> k

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
back here it should be about 1.5 k
