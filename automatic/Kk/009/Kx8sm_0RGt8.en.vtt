00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000 

I<00:00:08.179> call<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.330> one

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
I call this one

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.150 
I call this one
we<00:00:12.010> start<00:00:12.309> but<00:00:12.519> just

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
we start but just

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.890 
we start but just
tip<00:00:13.490> down<00:00:14.440> and<00:00:15.550> then<00:00:16.550> we<00:00:16.700> fold<00:00:16.940> each<00:00:17.240> edge<00:00:19.900> just

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
tip down and then we fold each edge just

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.380 
tip down and then we fold each edge just
the<00:00:21.080> very<00:00:21.259> edge<00:00:21.820> down<00:00:27.250> just<00:00:28.250> like<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.669> very

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
the very edge down just like that very

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.200 
the very edge down just like that very
narrow<00:00:29.810> edge<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:31.340> same<00:00:31.609> thing<00:00:31.880> on<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.180> other

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
narrow edge the same thing on the other

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
narrow edge the same thing on the other
side

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.050 

you<00:00:41.230> want<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.560> start<00:00:41.830> your<00:00:41.920> fold<00:00:42.340> as<00:00:42.550> close<00:00:42.820> to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
you want to start your fold as close to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.310 
you want to start your fold as close to
the<00:00:43.180> tip<00:00:43.420> as<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.750> possibly<00:00:44.260> can<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.080> same

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
the tip as you possibly can do the same

00:00:47.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
the tip as you possibly can do the same
thing<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.860> fold<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.630> tip<00:00:52.630> down<00:00:54.780> no<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.989> edge

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:15.970 

just<00:01:04.239> like<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.010> other<00:01:06.040> side

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.920 

and<00:01:16.980> we<00:01:17.220> open<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.420> other<00:01:18.600> two<00:01:18.870> battles<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.030> do

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and we open the other two battles and do

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
and we open the other two battles and do
the<00:01:22.080> same<00:01:22.350> thing<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:27.830> just<00:01:28.830> folding<00:01:29.250> down

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the same thing on them just folding down

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420 
the same thing on them just folding down
the<00:01:29.640> very<00:01:29.910> edge<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.950> did<00:01:32.010> on<00:01:32.160> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the very edge just like I did on the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:50.560 
the very edge just like I did on the
other<00:01:32.580> two<00:01:32.820> pedals<00:01:42.500> okay<00:01:44.210> one<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:48.860> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
other two pedals okay one more and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.440 
other two pedals okay one more and
remember<00:01:51.570> there's<00:01:52.289> a<00:01:52.350> pause<00:01:52.680> button<00:01:53.450> right

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450

that pause button so you can get caught

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.740 
that pause button so you can get caught
back<00:02:05.430> up

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.310 

okay<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.190> we've<00:02:13.400> got<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.820> our<00:02:13.850> petals<00:02:14.330> folded

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
okay so we've got all our petals folded

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.120 
okay so we've got all our petals folded
down<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.820> little<00:02:17.000> bit<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.620> next<00:02:18.890> step

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
down just a little bit and the next step

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.040 
down just a little bit and the next step
is<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> open<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.560> make<00:02:21.740> sure<00:02:21.770> our<00:02:21.980> flowers

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
is to open and we make sure our flowers

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.320 
is to open and we make sure our flowers
square<00:02:24.050> forms<00:02:24.620> across<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:27.290> open<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.710> pedal

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
square forms across and we open a pedal

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.690 
square forms across and we open a pedal
and<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:30.860> curling<00:02:31.490> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and this is just like curling the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.500 
and this is just like curling the
instant<00:02:32.120> flower<00:02:32.890> what<00:02:33.890> we<00:02:34.100> do<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.580> we<00:02:34.760> curl<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
instant flower what we do is we curl the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.300 
instant flower what we do is we curl the
pedal<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:37.300> lot<00:02:38.300> see<00:02:39.200> how<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.500> curled<00:02:39.860> by<00:02:40.070> down

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
pedal a lot see how it curled by down

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.000 
pedal a lot see how it curled by down
and<00:02:41.270> I'm<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.660> I'm<00:02:41.870> pushing<00:02:42.290> up<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.800> my

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and I'm just I'm pushing up with my

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.300 
and I'm just I'm pushing up with my
index<00:02:43.220> fingers<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.989> get<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.290> curl<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.920> occur

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
index fingers to get that curl to occur

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.250 
index fingers to get that curl to occur
so<00:02:47.300> open<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.989> pedal<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:51.370> force<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:53.050> with<00:02:54.050> my

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so open the pedal I force it up with my

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.430 
so open the pedal I force it up with my
index<00:02:54.500> fingers<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.840> pedal<00:02:56.840> just<00:02:57.050> curls

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
index fingers and the pedal just curls

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
index fingers and the pedal just curls
right<00:02:57.680> down<00:02:58.270> just<00:02:59.270> like<00:02:59.420> that<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.150> next

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
right down just like that and the next

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:14.130 
right down just like that and the next
one

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.470 

pull<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.260> pedal<00:03:15.590> up<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:17.360> curl<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.020> down<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
pull the pedal up and curl it down and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:35.190 
pull the pedal up and curl it down and
now<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.690> last<00:03:20.960> petal<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:32.230> then<00:03:33.230> we<00:03:33.410> shape<00:03:33.650> it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
now the last petal and then we shape it

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.850 
now the last petal and then we shape it
and<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.560> ourselves<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:37.130> lady<00:03:37.340> slipper
