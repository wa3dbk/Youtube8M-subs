okay my boy Thane I actually took a

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.820 
okay my boy Thane I actually took a
little<00:05:04.810> bit<00:05:04.960> longer<00:05:05.200> than<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.470> might<00:05:05.710> of

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
little bit longer than I might of

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.370 
little bit longer than I might of
thoughts<00:05:06.070> but<00:05:06.400> um<00:05:08.460> let's<00:05:09.460> see<00:05:09.610> we'll<00:05:10.090> see

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
thoughts but um let's see we'll see

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.350 
thoughts but um let's see we'll see
let's<00:05:11.380> go<00:05:11.500> talk<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.860> totleigh<00:05:12.130> I'm<00:05:13.090> probably

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
let's go talk to totleigh I'm probably

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.450 
let's go talk to totleigh I'm probably
just<00:05:13.510> gonna<00:05:13.750> actually<00:05:14.710> make<00:05:14.980> this<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.190> whole

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
just gonna actually make this a whole

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.030 
just gonna actually make this a whole
separate<00:05:15.760> episode<00:05:16.350> just<00:05:17.350> quick<00:05:17.620> seven

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
separate episode just quick seven

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.950 
separate episode just quick seven
minutes<00:05:18.460> or<00:05:18.700> we'll<00:05:19.180> probably<00:05:19.420> end<00:05:19.570> up<00:05:19.750> being

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
minutes or we'll probably end up being

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.860 
minutes or we'll probably end up being
around<00:05:20.200> 10<00:05:20.560> or<00:05:20.590> something<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.310> don't<00:05:21.400> know<00:05:21.870> yeah

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
around 10 or something I don't know yeah

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.390 
around 10 or something I don't know yeah
it<00:05:22.960> tally<00:05:23.170> won't<00:05:23.440> take<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.680> long<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:24.220> I'm

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
it tally won't take that long so I'm

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.970 
it tally won't take that long so I'm
guessing<00:05:24.610> around<00:05:24.820> seven<00:05:25.360> minutes<00:05:25.630> will<00:05:25.840> be

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
guessing around seven minutes will be

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:37.170 
guessing around seven minutes will be
the<00:05:26.980> most<00:05:27.190> accurate<00:05:27.430> judgement<00:05:28.300> for<00:05:28.390> that

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180
