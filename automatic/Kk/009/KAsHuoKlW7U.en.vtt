00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
or if you've used them and then also

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.590 
or if you've used them and then also
your<00:01:09.930> additional<00:01:10.470> ones<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.890> said<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.700> one

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
your additional ones like I said so one

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
your additional ones like I said so one
of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> things<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.170> big<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.500> us<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of the things that's big for us is to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130 
of the things that's big for us is to
make<00:01:14.820> sure<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.270> picking<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> flight

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
make sure that you're picking a flight

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.830 
make sure that you're picking a flight
time<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.400> good<00:01:17.880> time<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.540> kids

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
time that is a good time for your kids

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
time that is a good time for your kids
so<00:01:19.110> sometimes<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.460> early<00:01:20.670> flight<00:01:21.180> can

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
so sometimes a really early flight can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
so sometimes a really early flight can
actually<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.409> nice<00:01:22.560> especially<00:01:23.159> if

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
actually be kind of nice especially if

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
actually be kind of nice especially if
you<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> long<00:01:23.729> drive<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.479> Airport

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you have a long drive to your Airport

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
you have a long drive to your Airport
because<00:01:25.590> they're<00:01:25.920> also<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> know

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
because they're also kind of you know

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
because they're also kind of you know
just<00:01:27.000> waking<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.229> kind<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> have

it's<00:02:20.519> really<00:02:20.760> important<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.329> not<00:02:22.079> only<00:02:22.349> pick

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it's really important to not only pick

package cereal for instance in smaller
baggies<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.459> way<00:02:47.579> that<00:02:47.790> gets<00:02:47.909> spilled<00:02:48.329> you

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
baggies that way that gets spilled you

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.420 
baggies that way that gets spilled you
don't<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> giant<00:02:49.500> mess<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.889> clean<00:02:50.099> up<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
don't have a giant mess to clean up and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.460 
don't have a giant mess to clean up and
just<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.180> bits<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.109> can<00:02:52.319> kind

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
just have little bits and you can kind

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.690 
just have little bits and you can kind
of<00:02:52.500> give<00:02:52.650> them<00:02:52.829> what<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.099> need<00:02:53.129> kind<00:02:53.639> of

of give them what they need kind of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.099 
of give them what they need kind of
ration<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.209> if<00:02:54.359> that<00:02:54.510> makes<00:02:54.720> sense

ration it out if that makes sense

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.140 
ration it out if that makes sense
