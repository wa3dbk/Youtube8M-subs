four species had been visiting earth for
thousands<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> years<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.880> own

thousands of years and this is my own
view<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.680> stage<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:27.500> except<00:00:28.500> for

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
view at the stage as well so except for

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.669 
view at the stage as well so except for
that<00:00:28.859> they're<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> couple<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.939> things

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679

that they're just a couple of things
that<00:00:31.679> we've<00:00:31.890> talked<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.669> I'd<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
that we've talked about that I'd like to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.400

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
refer to and one was that we were

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.369 
refer to and one was that we were
referring<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> them<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:39.230> until<00:00:40.230> this

she was the first one actually named

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.850 
she was the first one actually named

so<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:31.310> don't<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> any<00:01:33.619> more<00:01:34.619> refer

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
so I don't think we can any more refer

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
so I don't think we can any more refer
them<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.400> them<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:36.960> they're<00:01:37.140> not

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
them to them as they because they're not

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249 
them to them as they because they're not
an<00:01:37.409> amorphous<00:01:37.890> mass<00:01:38.810> there<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:39.930> different

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
an amorphous mass there are different

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
an amorphous mass there are different
species<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.950> consequently<00:01:41.610> may<00:01:41.909> have

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
species and consequently may have

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.870 
species and consequently may have
different<00:01:42.180> agendas<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.700> can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
different agendas I don't think we can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
different agendas I don't think we can
say<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> same<00:01:46.439> agenda

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
say that they all have the same agenda

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.319 
say that they all have the same agenda
any<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> could<00:01:47.759> say<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
any more than that we could say that the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.679 
any more than that we could say that the
United<00:01:48.659> States<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:49.290> China<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> Russia<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:51.090> the

United States of China and Russia at the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
United States of China and Russia at the
same<00:01:51.899> agenda<00:01:52.770> our<00:01:53.040> real<00:01:53.340> interests<00:01:53.880> may<00:01:54.030> be

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
same agenda our real interests may be

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.590 
same agenda our real interests may be
very<00:01:54.420> similar<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.790> now<00:01:56.850> our<00:01:57.180> perceived

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
very similar but as of now our perceived

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
very similar but as of now our perceived
interests<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.380> still<00:01:58.680> quite<00:01:59.610> far<00:02:00.240> apart<00:02:01.790> one

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
interests are still quite far apart one

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.969 
interests are still quite far apart one
more<00:02:03.060> observation<00:02:03.509> before<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.350> begin<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.950> I
