00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
get started first things first we have

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.219 
get started first things first we have
our<00:01:44.679> blender<00:01:44.950> here<00:01:44.979> set<00:01:45.369> up<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.810> I've<00:01:46.810> already

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
our blender here set up and I've already

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.620 
our blender here set up and I've already
juiced<00:01:47.590> three<00:01:48.069> limes<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.609> zested<00:01:49.390> them<00:01:49.509> as

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
juiced three limes and zested them as

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.550 
juiced three limes and zested them as
well<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.319> in<00:01:50.560> with<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.799> zest<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.810> juice<00:01:53.079> from

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
well so in with the zest the juice from

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.110 
well so in with the zest the juice from
three<00:01:53.799> limes

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.030 

some<00:01:59.120> chili<00:01:59.330> paste

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
some chili paste

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.800 
some chili paste
so<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.160> chili<00:02:01.370> paste<00:02:01.610> adds<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.510> spicy

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
so the chili paste adds that spicy

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.480 
so the chili paste adds that spicy
element<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.380> again<00:02:03.710> it's<00:02:03.860> kind<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.160> like<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
element so again it's kind of like the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.280 
element so again it's kind of like the
yin<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.910> yang<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.780> really<00:02:06.020> great

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
yin and the yang and it's a really great

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.060 
yin and the yang and it's a really great
balance<00:02:06.470> between<00:02:06.740> spicy<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.400> sweet<00:02:07.520> and
