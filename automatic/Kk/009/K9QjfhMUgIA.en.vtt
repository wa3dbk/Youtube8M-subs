00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.160
 I say this is going to be a video to see how the ball ordered 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080
 files and backgrounds on your computer 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.359
 chopped there's been a century 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.530
 we are going to be 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.530
 let's go to my partner 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.789
 within the achievements of hard disks 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.359
 arelis free 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 let's find the seiki unit the unit that the boat 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.179
 vamo ávila units 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 with a doublet 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.740
 been united to the eighth arcando all the argumentation waters 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.460
 to minimize it 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.550
 and let's fly the opposite 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.319
 grabbing her the blue part 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:48.410
 we can 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.060
 the Christian 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.360
 we drag it to the right 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 and we return April 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 there is no government 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.420
 we open 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 again the unit once 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.300
 here we do the same but 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.500
 we minimize it 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 I turn to the right 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.900
 then remove it iberdrola 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.610
 a little bit longer 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 Clicking with fashion and then it becomes residents of Chicago 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 let's find a folder to create a new fund 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 safety in the area of ​​land use 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160
 the mood units 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.340
 the two units 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 and that he called a new folder 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 in that moment of the fact very well 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 and we give you click where it says 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.370
 but obviously I know 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.400
 create a background we put the name 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.570
 for example one 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.570
 ballots 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.039
 of the airbus 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.400
 because he was a click on the white part so he believes himself 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.119
 and the same with a doublet 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:18.799
 we are already inside of me 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.989
 the unit of 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.629
 Within the folio of the Charrúas ballots we are going to focus on any 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.399
 another zoo in london where is 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.559
 I vote 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.669
 mixed for example in 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.969
 the power to take place within a single folio 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.969
 we open the floor 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.489
 the ballot of light 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.579
 for example playing 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.319
 these documents that according to fat 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.699
 táboas realizes his ticket of light the first document we put him 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.329
 a lucid man 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.209
 the stretches 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.949
 the other great advantage 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.919
 with the same left button 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.079
 thematically secure 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.999
 the second we give a click and then another that undifferentiated we put plus 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.639
 2 another click on the white part 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.639
 by the left he is dragged by borghi 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.549
 we can the way a peak in right over the following imboden if we give it 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.289
 really to rename 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.289
 we expose light 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.699
 throughout december in brussels and others are stretches 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.379
 inside the white part of the bottom of without moving here 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.129
 Those are 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.149
 3 and you die 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.149
 that I have light we are going to make a back 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.749
 we already see that within the unit 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.649
 let's hope the soleolum light ballots 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.359
 because I love being someone else who says 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.139
 another click on the white part 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.139
 lamy coin of another that says folder 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.370
 for another side background he 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.969
 and we put him 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.740
 Photos 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.870
 min 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.200
 foals of the pair of the ncaa and we give him 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200
 double click on the background the hemicycle background 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 we started to ballast the funds the photos 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.669
 then the man 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.610
 for example or 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.029
 name 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.029
 alessa 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.879
 andrés a 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.499
 by 0 to 1 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.309
 was going to tail that we drag percent of the bottom 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:00.900
 vicente photo 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.900
 to the next photo like 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.099
 an achievement in law 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.409
 rename left python 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.610
 and we put such acts 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.150
 roger collections 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
 we return to the closed it drags it body 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.339
 and so we are going to have 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:22.909
 each folio 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.099
 computer 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.099
 within the same unit 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
 photo my daughters light tickets 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.800
 one by one the oea and ordering 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 all this within the school menu 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.960
 in this same background before dying and the same thing is so we look for 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.270
 we appreciate the loyalty key 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.060
 it is not the time of our life here or we are going through a single 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.259
 shoulder but you see 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.499
 ordering it 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:56.729
 imposing him at home 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.860
 here portugal sea commented a different name and inside an enclosure holder 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.100
 because we would be
