I<00:00:14.629> think<00:00:15.629> I<00:00:15.719> follow<00:00:15.929> signs<00:00:16.610> more<00:00:17.610> than<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.910> do

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
I think I follow signs more than you do

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
I think I follow signs more than you do
you<00:00:18.270> watch<00:00:18.450> all<00:00:18.689> your<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> prior<00:00:19.289> no<00:00:19.500> boxsets

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
you watch all your to prior no boxsets

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.659 
you watch all your to prior no boxsets
and<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:20.849> that<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:21.509> watching<00:00:22.669> science

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
and all that lot I'm watching science

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.880 
and all that lot I'm watching science
read<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.140> get<00:00:25.259> anything<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.829> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
read it you don't get anything from it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.639 
read it you don't get anything from it
do<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.790> minute<00:00:27.320> but<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.380> don't<00:00:28.529> learn

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
do it for a minute but you don't learn

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:29.900 
do it for a minute but you don't learn
anything<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.130> goes<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.669> there's<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.820> guy

anything it goes in and there's a guy
and<00:00:30.149> then<00:00:30.270> you<00:00:30.390> then<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.899> extrapolate<00:00:31.349> in

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
and then you then you extrapolate in

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.549 
and then you then you extrapolate in
your<00:00:32.189> own<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.550> world<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.329> bit<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> knowledge

good<00:01:00.980> bit<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> science<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.640> heard<00:01:05.570> there's<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
good bit of science I heard there's a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.209 
good bit of science I heard there's a
load<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> birds<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.259> America<00:01:07.740> laughs<00:01:07.920> just

it's very nice fine there is it sort of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's very nice fine there is it sort of
that<00:01:14.220> line<00:01:14.370> we<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.420> yet<00:01:15.770> your

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that line we don't know yet your

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.740 
that line we don't know yet your
Blastoise<00:01:17.190> say<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.729> last<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
Blastoise say that we don't last the

Blastoise say that we don't last the
best<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> science<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.159> when

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
best bit of science I think the bit when

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
best bit of science I think the bit when
you<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
you go all what was that when you go I

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.070 
you go all what was that when you go I
flew<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.159> big<00:01:23.670> wind<00:01:24.150> er<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.600> know

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
flew into a big wind er you know

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.890 
flew into a big wind er you know
boring<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
boring I like that bit of it I like the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
boring I like that bit of it I like the
bit<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.010> kid<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.340> no<00:01:29.400> legs

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
bit of can we make this kid with no legs

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.310 
bit of can we make this kid with no legs
walk<00:01:29.850> no<00:01:30.420> give<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> yeah<00:01:32.010> we<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.310> boring

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
walk no give it a go yeah we have boring

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.750 
walk no give it a go yeah we have boring
it's<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> busy<00:01:34.590> world<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.190> kid<00:01:35.369> didn't<00:01:35.610> walk

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
it's the busy world that kid didn't walk

it's the busy world that kid didn't walk
I<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> bit<00:01:36.690> when<00:01:36.840> he's<00:01:36.960> dragging

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I like the bit when he's dragging

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
I like the bit when he's dragging
himself<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.549> doing<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.030> do

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
himself about what you doing will we do

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
himself about what you doing will we do
it<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.170> ever<00:01:40.290> make<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.680> boy<00:01:40.890> war<00:01:41.189> that's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it will we ever make this boy war that's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
it will we ever make this boy war that's
not<00:01:41.850> science<00:01:42.390> I'd<00:01:43.320> love<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> show

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
not science I'd love to see that show

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
not science I'd love to see that show
coming<00:01:45.000> soon<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> Science<00:01:45.869> Channel<00:01:45.900> will

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
coming soon to the Science Channel will

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.570 
coming soon to the Science Channel will
we<00:01:46.650> ever<00:01:46.830> make<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> boy<00:01:47.520> walk<00:01:47.880> yeah<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.430> he's

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
we ever make this boy walk yeah so he's

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.240 
we ever make this boy walk yeah so he's
got<00:01:50.760> some<00:01:50.790> new<00:01:51.119> mechanical<00:01:51.659> legs<00:01:51.900> so<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> ped
