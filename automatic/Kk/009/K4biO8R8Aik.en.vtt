00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
a review about it so I think the first

a review about it so I think the first
thing<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> start<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
thing that I would like to start with is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
thing that I would like to start with is
the<00:00:34.950> overall<00:00:35.219> size<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:37.430> yoga<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:39.030> pad

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.350 
the overall size of the yoga think pad
as<00:00:39.770> some<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:40.890> viewers<00:00:41.219> may<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.670> already<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
as some of my viewers may know already I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.400 
as some of my viewers may know already I
own<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.260> Lenovo<00:00:44.100> y50<00:00:44.660> which<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.379> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
own the Lenovo y50 which is over here on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010 
own the Lenovo y50 which is over here on
the<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.879> thought<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> would<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the right and I thought that would be a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.029 
the right and I thought that would be a
good<00:00:49.590> size<00:00:49.860> comparison<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.010> roughly<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
good size comparison this is a roughly a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.540 
good size comparison this is a roughly a
13<00:00:53.670> inch<00:00:53.940> laptop<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.510> guess

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
13 inch laptop and this is a I guess

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.680 
13 inch laptop and this is a I guess
15.6<00:00:59.550> inch<00:00:59.789> laptop<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:02.210> one<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> things<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
15.6 inch laptop so one of the things I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
15.6 inch laptop so one of the things I
wanted<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> stack<00:01:05.220> them

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.370 

kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> more<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> middle<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:27.380> I'll

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
kind of more into the middle and I'll

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
kind of more into the middle and I'll
just<00:01:28.740> put<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.159> guy<00:01:29.400> right<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just put this guy right on top of the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.890 
just put this guy right on top of the
y50<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:35.630> quite<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> size

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
y50 and as you can see quite a size

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
y50 and as you can see quite a size

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
difference so there's a view from the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
difference so there's a view from the
top<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:42.320> I'll<00:01:43.320> flip<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> side<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
top and I'll flip this to the side and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.889

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
we can look at those so here they are

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.499 
we can look at those so here they are
from<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> side<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.549> apologize<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.390> the

from the side and I apologize for the
lighting<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.500> kind<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.280> hard<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.729> but

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.729 
thing for a 15.6 inch laptop you know I
guess<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.980> comparison<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:24.319> not<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.560> much

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
guess in comparison is not that much

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.010 
guess in comparison is not that much
more<00:02:26.010> maybe<00:02:26.849> just<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> thickness<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
more maybe just the thickness of the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.430 
more maybe just the thickness of the
screen<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:29.130> only<00:02:29.340> 50<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.819> have<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.450> trusty<00:02:31.140> tape

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
screen I'm only 50 I have my trusty tape

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.890 
screen I'm only 50 I have my trusty tape
measure<00:02:31.739> out<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:33.150> give<00:02:33.330> some<00:02:33.569> overall

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
measure out to give some overall

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.860 
measure out to give some overall
dimensions<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.980> yoga<00:02:35.310> from<00:02:35.880> left<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
dimensions of the yoga from left to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.870 
dimensions of the yoga from left to
right<00:02:37.280> or<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:39.319> guess<00:02:40.319> maybe<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.099> length<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
right or I guess maybe the length of the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.680 
right or I guess maybe the length of the
computer<00:02:42.650> at<00:02:43.650> least<00:02:43.830> from<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.099> front<00:02:44.400> is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
computer at least from the front is

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.590 
computer at least from the front is
roughly<00:02:45.690> about<00:02:46.370> 12<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> half<00:02:47.730> inches<00:02:48.330> from

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
roughly about 12 and a half inches from

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.570 
roughly about 12 and a half inches from
the<00:02:49.080> side<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.489> yoga<00:02:50.880> laptop<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.980> about<00:02:53.250> 8

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
the side the yoga laptop is just about 8

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.479 
the side the yoga laptop is just about 8
and<00:02:54.019> 3/4<00:02:55.019> inches<00:02:56.120> plus<00:02:57.120> -<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.140> even<00:02:59.130> though<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
and 3/4 inches plus - and even though it

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.150 
and 3/4 inches plus - and even though it
may<00:02:59.640> be<00:02:59.670> hard<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:01.140> thing<00:03:01.380> focuses<00:03:01.980> in

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
may be hard to see this thing focuses in

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.089 
may be hard to see this thing focuses in
the<00:03:02.610> overall<00:03:03.150> height<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.260> laptop<00:03:04.920> when

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the overall height of the laptop when

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.850 
the overall height of the laptop when
it's<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.400> closed<00:03:05.610> position<00:03:06.380> like<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.500> said<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
it's in a closed position like I said is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.520 
it's in a closed position like I said is
about<00:03:08.069> 3/4<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.700> an<00:03:08.910> inch<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.840> addition<00:03:10.230> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
about 3/4 of an inch and in addition to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.050 
about 3/4 of an inch and in addition to
the<00:03:10.830> overall<00:03:10.950> dimensions<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.849> just

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the overall dimensions that I just

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.430 
the overall dimensions that I just
showed<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.769> weight<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.700> laptop<00:03:14.910> is

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
showed you the weight of this laptop is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.890 
showed you the weight of this laptop is
roughly<00:03:16.579> 3.5<00:03:17.579> pounds<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.870> pretty

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
roughly 3.5 pounds so it's it's a pretty

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.069 
roughly 3.5 pounds so it's it's a pretty
light<00:03:22.500> machine<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.340> my<00:03:23.549> opinion<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.239> starting

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
light machine in my opinion now starting

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.920 
light machine in my opinion now starting
on<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> left<00:03:25.560> side<00:03:26.359> of<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.510> machine<00:03:27.750> I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
on the left side of the machine I

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.569 
on the left side of the machine I
thought<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.170> would<00:03:28.380> go<00:03:28.500> through<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.130> talk

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
thought I would go through and talk

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.770 
thought I would go through and talk
about<00:03:29.640> each<00:03:30.769> side<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:33.030> computer<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.569> show

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
about each side of the computer and show

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.580 
about each side of the computer and show
you<00:03:33.840> its<00:03:34.829> power<00:03:35.340> ports<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.590> input/output

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
you its power ports and input/output

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.780 
you its power ports and input/output
ports<00:03:38.120> things<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.500> right<00:03:40.709> here<00:03:41.280> is

is what I was talking about when we were
looking<00:04:21.510> at<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.659> front<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:23.550> little<00:04:23.849> guy<00:04:23.970> is

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
which I will talk about in a little bit

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.939 
which I will talk about in a little bit
when<00:04:43.379> we<00:04:43.409> get<00:04:44.159> the<00:04:44.280> laptop<00:04:44.460> started<00:04:45.120> up<00:04:45.210> and

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
when we get the laptop started up and

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.179 
when we get the laptop started up and
we'll<00:04:46.949> see<00:04:47.129> how<00:04:47.280> well<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.669> guy<00:04:47.849> works<00:04:48.090> too<00:04:49.189> so

right next to that with the single dot
is<00:04:53.659> the<00:04:54.659> power<00:04:55.050> switch<00:04:57.169> it's<00:04:58.169> hard<00:04:58.469> to<00:04:58.590> tell

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
is the power switch it's hard to tell

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.149 
is the power switch it's hard to tell
from<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:59.219> video<00:04:59.520> but<00:04:59.879> this<00:05:00.060> is<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:00.539> a

reader this is the second of the two USB
ports<00:05:34.169> are<00:05:34.949> on<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.250> computer<00:05:35.639> this<00:05:36.150> one<00:05:36.360> is

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
ports are on the computer this one is

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.159 
ports are on the computer this one is
not<00:05:36.659> powered<00:05:37.110> by<00:05:37.259> the<00:05:37.319> way<00:05:38.270> here<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:39.419> an<00:05:39.569> HDMI

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
not powered by the way here is an HDMI

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.490 
not powered by the way here is an HDMI
port<00:05:40.409> and<00:05:41.419> right<00:05:42.419> here<00:05:42.690> we<00:05:42.900> have<00:05:42.930> the

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
port and right here we have the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.499 
port and right here we have the
Kensington<00:05:44.009> lock<00:05:44.129> so<00:05:44.580> this<00:05:44.940> is<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.180> back<00:05:45.330> of

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
Kensington lock so this is the back of

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.659 
Kensington lock so this is the back of
the<00:05:45.569> machine<00:05:45.839> and<00:05:46.759> see<00:05:47.759> if<00:05:48.509> I<00:05:48.599> can<00:05:48.690> get<00:05:48.810> in<00:05:48.930> here

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
the machine and see if I can get in here

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.990 
the machine and see if I can get in here
these<00:05:50.669> right<00:05:51.180> here<00:05:51.629> are<00:05:52.039> the<00:05:53.039> heat<00:05:53.250> vents<00:05:53.520> so

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
these right here are the heat vents so

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.850 
these right here are the heat vents so
this<00:05:54.330> would<00:05:54.509> be<00:05:54.689> the<00:05:55.680> exhaust<00:05:56.039> for<00:05:57.029> the<00:05:57.089> heat<00:05:57.300> I

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
this would be the exhaust for the heat I

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.379 
this would be the exhaust for the heat I
guess<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.009> only<00:05:59.129> other<00:05:59.250> notable<00:05:59.819> thing<00:06:00.060> here

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
guess the only other notable thing here

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.189 
guess the only other notable thing here
are<00:06:00.949> these<00:06:01.949> screen<00:06:02.909> hinges<00:06:03.389> there<00:06:03.839> are<00:06:03.900> two<00:06:04.080> of

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
are these screen hinges there are two of

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.950 
are these screen hinges there are two of
them<00:06:04.319> one<00:06:04.650> here<00:06:04.919> one<00:06:05.580> here<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.120> when<00:06:06.389> we<00:06:06.569> show

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
them one here one here and when we show

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.469 
them one here one here and when we show
the<00:06:07.860> different<00:06:08.189> modes<00:06:08.400> that<00:06:08.699> this<00:06:08.819> laptop<00:06:09.000> can

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
the different modes that this laptop can

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.420 
the different modes that this laptop can
be<00:06:09.509> in<00:06:09.779> you'll<00:06:10.469> kind<00:06:10.710> of<00:06:10.770> see<00:06:10.830> these<00:06:11.099> in<00:06:11.310> action

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
be in you'll kind of see these in action

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.629 
be in you'll kind of see these in action
I've<00:06:12.000> flipped<00:06:12.779> the<00:06:12.930> laptop<00:06:13.349> over<00:06:13.740> and<00:06:13.979> we<00:06:14.520> are

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
I've flipped the laptop over and we are

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.950 
I've flipped the laptop over and we are
now<00:06:14.789> looking<00:06:15.000> at<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.330> underside<00:06:15.569> of<00:06:15.779> the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
now looking at the underside of the

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.719 
now looking at the underside of the
machine<00:06:16.229> back<00:06:16.680> up<00:06:16.710> here<00:06:17.039> at<00:06:17.129> the<00:06:17.250> top<00:06:17.460> you<00:06:17.699> can

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
machine back up here at the top you can

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.839 
machine back up here at the top you can
see<00:06:18.029> the<00:06:18.060> underside<00:06:18.419> of<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.550> hinges<00:06:20.550> for<00:06:20.759> the

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
see the underside of the hinges for the

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.559 
see the underside of the hinges for the
screen<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.419> here<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.139> another<00:06:22.409> view<00:06:22.919> of<00:06:23.569> the

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
screen and here is another view of the

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.559 
screen and here is another view of the
exhaust<00:06:24.930> vents<00:06:25.319> and<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:26.279> believe<00:06:26.639> that<00:06:27.000> this<00:06:27.210> is

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
exhaust vents and I believe that this is

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.920 
exhaust vents and I believe that this is
clearly<00:06:28.469> the<00:06:28.620> intake<00:06:29.610> vents<00:06:29.879> at<00:06:30.419> least<00:06:30.689> that's

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
clearly the intake vents at least that's

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.920 
clearly the intake vents at least that's
my<00:06:31.520> assumption<00:06:32.520> please<00:06:33.089> let<00:06:33.240> me<00:06:33.360> know<00:06:33.509> in<00:06:33.870> the

my assumption please let me know in the
