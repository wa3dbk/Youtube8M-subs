00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
once the roots are drive move on to the

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.069 
once the roots are drive move on to the
end<00:01:00.309> you<00:01:00.519> basically<00:01:00.909> want<00:01:01.119> to<00:01:01.210> blast<00:01:01.420> dry<00:01:01.839> so

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
it's about eighty percent drag to move

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's about eighty percent drag to move
on<00:01:04.119> to<00:01:04.390> using<00:01:04.539> a<00:01:04.809> brush<00:01:05.019> what<00:01:05.649> you<00:01:05.740> want<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.950> do

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
well so it helps to smooth out the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.790 
well so it helps to smooth out the
cuticle<00:01:09.759> as<00:01:09.940> your<00:01:10.119> hair<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.420> drying<00:01:10.690> so<00:01:11.350> take

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
easier I just like to use a kind of

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.370 
easier I just like to use a kind of
paddle<00:01:16.119> brush<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.750> sure<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:16.990> comb<00:01:17.200> through

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
the section first and then basically

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.450

on<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.700> cold<00:02:56.940> setting<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.650> after<00:02:58.650> each

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
on the cold setting and after each

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560 
on the cold setting and after each
section<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.280> straighten<00:02:59.790> go<00:03:00.210> through<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
section you straighten go through the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.120 
section you straighten go through the
blow-dryer<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.350> going<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.620> really<00:03:01.770> seal

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
blow-dryer this is going to really seal

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.920 
blow-dryer this is going to really seal
all<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.520> bonds<00:03:02.940> new<00:03:03.150> hair<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.630> make<00:03:03.750> your

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
hair a lot straighter and stop the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.580 
hair a lot straighter and stop the
humidity<00:03:06.239> from<00:03:06.420> making<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> going<00:03:07.140> frizzy

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
humidity from making it going frizzy

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.260 
humidity from making it going frizzy
this<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.130> make<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> last<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.850> lot

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
this is going to make it last a lot

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.030 
this is going to make it last a lot
longer<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.750> well<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.500> any<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.890> real

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
longer as well for any kind of real

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.010 
longer as well for any kind of real
curly<00:03:11.430> bits<00:03:11.580> around<00:03:11.760> your<00:03:12.000> hairline<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.600> just

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
curly bits around your hairline I just

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.750 
curly bits around your hairline I just
like<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.290> grab<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.620> with<00:03:13.739> my<00:03:13.770> fingers<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.580> then

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
like to grab it with my fingers and then

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.580 
like to grab it with my fingers and then
put<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.239> iron<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.780> way<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> find<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.380> lot

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
put the iron in that way I find it a lot

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.830 
put the iron in that way I find it a lot
easier<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.250> get<00:03:17.730> real<00:03:18.000> close<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> scalp

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
easier to get real close to the scalp

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.170 
easier to get real close to the scalp
that<00:03:18.989> way<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.950> continue<00:03:20.730> straightening

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that way so continue straightening

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.180 
that way so continue straightening
section<00:03:21.840> by<00:03:21.959> section<00:03:22.020> all<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.680> way<00:03:22.860> through

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
section by section all the way through

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.460 
section by section all the way through
the<00:03:23.310> top<00:03:23.520> especially<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> top<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.290> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
the top especially on the top I like to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.199 
the top especially on the top I like to
use<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> blow-dryer<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.340> lot<00:03:26.550> more<00:03:26.760> because

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
use a blow-dryer a lot more because

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.590 
use a blow-dryer a lot more because
these<00:03:27.600> bits<00:03:27.959> are<00:03:28.170> more<00:03:28.489> exposed<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.420> free

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
these bits are more exposed to the free

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.330 
these bits are more exposed to the free
radicals<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.290> things<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.070> it's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
radicals and things like that and it's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.610 
radicals and things like that and it's
just<00:03:32.520> going<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> make<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.880> style<00:03:33.570> last<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.290> lot

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
just going to make it style last a lot

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.830 
just going to make it style last a lot
longer

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.570 

so<00:03:39.840> check<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> back<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.920> use<00:03:41.040> mirror<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
so check the back I just use mirror and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.250 
so check the back I just use mirror and
kind<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.850> hold<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.210> behind<00:03:42.569> me<00:03:42.810> obviously

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
kind of hold it behind me obviously

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.690 
kind of hold it behind me obviously
you'll<00:03:43.440> need<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.830> standing<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.280> front<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.610> a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
you'll need to be standing in front of a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.220 
you'll need to be standing in front of a
mirror<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.540> want<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.780> make<00:03:45.900> sure<00:03:45.930> the
