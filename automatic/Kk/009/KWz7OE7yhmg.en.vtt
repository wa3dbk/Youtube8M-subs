only thing I can tell is now we're back

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.370 
only thing I can tell is now we're back
to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> point<00:01:50.250> where<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.659> clutch<00:01:52.020> rubbers

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to the point where the clutch rubbers

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560 
to the point where the clutch rubbers
are<00:01:52.560> worn<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:52.979> again<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.640> we've<00:01:53.700> started<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
are worn out again and we've started to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.560 
are worn out again and we've started to
develop<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.049> vibration<00:01:56.030> I've<00:01:57.030> actually<00:01:57.180> run<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
develop a vibration I've actually run to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.609 
develop a vibration I've actually run to
a<00:01:57.630> couple<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> riders<00:01:58.350> who<00:01:58.500> were

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
a couple of the riders who were

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.060 
a couple of the riders who were
suffering<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.189> vibrations<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.909> their<00:02:01.070> 450

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
suffering with vibrations on their 450

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.480 
suffering with vibrations on their 450
or<00:02:02.310> 500<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.960> think<00:02:04.649> that's<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.250> its

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
or 500 and I think that's what is its

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270 
or 500 and I think that's what is its
those<00:02:05.909> clutch<00:02:06.299> rubbers<00:02:06.689> wear<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.280> somewhere

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
those clutch rubbers wear out somewhere

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
those clutch rubbers wear out somewhere
around<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.610> hundred<00:02:08.940> hour<00:02:09.090> maybe<00:02:09.899> even

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
around the hundred hour maybe even

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.640 
around the hundred hour maybe even
slightly<00:02:10.379> less<00:02:10.890> range<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.420> develops<00:02:12.930> what

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
slightly less range and it develops what

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.640 
slightly less range and it develops what
feels<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.189> chassis<00:02:14.909> vibration<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:16.170> it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
feels like a chassis vibration it it it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.470 
feels like a chassis vibration it it it
feels<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.250> emanates<00:02:17.730> right<00:02:18.030> from<00:02:18.239> around

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
feels like it emanates right from around

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
feels like it emanates right from around
here<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> loose<00:02:19.230> swing<00:02:19.530> arm<00:02:19.709> pivot<00:02:19.980> or

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
here like a loose swing arm pivot or

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.399 
here like a loose swing arm pivot or
maybe<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.610> loose<00:02:20.760> swing<00:02:21.090> arm<00:02:21.269> bolt<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.260> it's

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
maybe a loose swing arm bolt but it's

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.869 
maybe a loose swing arm bolt but it's
really<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.950> clutch<00:02:23.340> rubbers<00:02:23.700> now

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
really the the clutch rubbers now

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.550 
really the the clutch rubbers now
there's<00:02:24.360> no<00:02:24.510> indication<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.379> clutch

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
there's no indication in the clutch

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.050 
there's no indication in the clutch
action<00:02:25.950> itself<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.459> there's<00:02:26.640> any<00:02:26.790> kind<00:02:26.939> of
