00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the damn place and so you want to just

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.750 
the damn place and so you want to just
pour<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.200> maybe<00:01:13.350> 2<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> 3<00:01:13.799> ounces<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.580> key

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
pour like maybe 2 to 3 ounces the key

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
pour like maybe 2 to 3 ounces the key
here<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.470> flick<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
here is to it's a little flick of the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
here is to it's a little flick of the
wrist<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> go

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
wrist and you want it to go

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
wrist and you want it to go
counterclockwise<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> left<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
counterclockwise so to the left and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
counterclockwise so to the left and
around<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> difficult<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.890> figure

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
around so this is difficult to figure

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.870 
around so this is difficult to figure
out<00:01:26.310> counterclockwise<00:01:27.150> clockwise<00:01:27.630> whatever

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
out counterclockwise clockwise whatever

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.090 
out counterclockwise clockwise whatever
I'll<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.140 

and<00:01:33.940> we're<00:01:34.570> going<00:01:34.900> towards<00:01:35.350> ourselves<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
and we're going towards ourselves to the

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.969 
and we're going towards ourselves to the
left<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.200> whole<00:01:41.380> counterclockwise

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
left now this whole counterclockwise

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.590 
left now this whole counterclockwise
clockwise<00:01:42.400> thing<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.060> little<00:01:43.330> bit<00:01:43.450> too

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
clockwise thing is a little bit too

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.360 
clockwise thing is a little bit too
difficult<00:01:44.050> when<00:01:44.680> you're<00:01:44.800> first<00:01:44.920> starting<00:01:45.070> out

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
difficult when you're first starting out

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.760 
difficult when you're first starting out
I<00:01:45.640> always<00:01:46.210> tell<00:01:46.390> people<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.869> put<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.229> glass<00:01:47.440> on

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
I always tell people to put the glass on

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.480 
I always tell people to put the glass on
a<00:01:47.860> table<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:49.600> then<00:01:50.020> put<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.070> actual

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
a table and and then put the the actual

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.820 
a table and and then put the the actual
stem<00:01:51.760> between<00:01:52.600> your<00:01:52.810> first<00:01:53.020> finger<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.710> your

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
stem between your first finger and your

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.530 
stem between your first finger and your
middle<00:01:53.860> finger<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.580> do<00:01:55.420> that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
middle finger and do that

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.840 
middle finger and do that
counterclockwise<00:01:56.320> motion<00:01:57.009> but<00:01:57.160> on<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.490> table

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
counterclockwise motion but on the table

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.760 
counterclockwise motion but on the table
and<00:01:58.119> then<00:01:58.660> you<00:01:58.690> can<00:01:58.780> still<00:01:59.080> get<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.229> really<00:01:59.470> good

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and then you can still get a really good

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.180 
and then you can still get a really good
swirl<00:02:00.300> with<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.450> wine<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:02.860> kind<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.040> fun

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
swirl with the wine and it's kind of fun

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.639 
swirl with the wine and it's kind of fun
to<00:02:03.280> do<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.020> funny<00:02:05.229> I'm<00:02:05.350> telling<00:02:05.590> you

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649

counterclockwise<00:02:06.039> but<00:02:06.580> there's<00:02:06.850> been<00:02:07.390> times

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
counterclockwise but there's been times

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.810 
counterclockwise but there's been times
on<00:02:08.050> my<00:02:08.170> travels<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:09.009> different<00:02:09.280> wine<00:02:09.399> regions

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
on my travels to different wine regions

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.100 
on my travels to different wine regions
and<00:02:10.030> I've<00:02:10.119> gone<00:02:10.270> on<00:02:10.390> press<00:02:10.630> trips<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.050> things

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
and I've gone on press trips and things

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.900 
and I've gone on press trips and things
like<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.860> I've<00:02:12.070> met<00:02:12.250> people<00:02:12.400> from

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
like that and I've met people from

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.199 
like that and I've met people from
Europe<00:02:13.270> or<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.630> Australia<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.410> they<00:02:15.340> swirl

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
Europe or in Australia and they swirl

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.080 
Europe or in Australia and they swirl
the<00:02:16.330> other<00:02:16.510> way<00:02:16.690> they<00:02:17.290> swirl<00:02:17.650> clockwise<00:02:18.520> which

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
the other way they swirl clockwise which

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.390 
the other way they swirl clockwise which
is<00:02:19.239> more<00:02:19.810> difficult<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.350> me<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.560> do<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.950> don't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
is more difficult for me to do I don't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.530 
is more difficult for me to do I don't
know<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.489> it's<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.180> probably<00:02:22.450> not

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
know if it's just it's probably not

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.699 
know if it's just it's probably not
because<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.840> where<00:02:23.050> they're<00:02:23.200> from<00:02:23.230> although

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
because of where they're from although

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.199 
because of where they're from although
they<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.370> whole<00:02:24.550> like<00:02:24.730> Australian

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
they have that whole like Australian

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.420 
they have that whole like Australian
thing<00:02:25.360> where<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> water<00:02:26.140> flushes<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.250> other

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
thing where the water flushes the other

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.000 
thing where the water flushes the other
way<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.670> don't<00:02:28.120> know<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.590> maybe<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.980> just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
way I don't know so maybe it just

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.320 
way I don't know so maybe it just
depends<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.489> your<00:02:30.550> own<00:02:30.700> personal<00:02:31.150> preference

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
depends on your own personal preference

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.270 
depends on your own personal preference
so<00:02:31.540> try<00:02:31.810> both<00:02:31.989> ways<00:02:32.019> but<00:02:32.769> it's<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.130> little

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
so try both ways but it's just a little

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.440 
so try both ways but it's just a little
bit<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.610> flick<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.910> wrist<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.300> that's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
bit of a flick of the wrist and that's

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.770 
bit of a flick of the wrist and that's
it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.330 
it
now<00:02:34.930> I'm<00:02:35.140> gonna<00:02:35.230> put<00:02:35.440> my<00:02:35.530> wine<00:02:35.709> glass<00:02:35.739> down<00:02:36.130> for

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
now I'm gonna put my wine glass down for

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.560 
now I'm gonna put my wine glass down for
a<00:02:36.400> second<00:02:36.700> because<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:37.000> want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.330> demonstrate

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
a second because I want to demonstrate

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.590 
a second because I want to demonstrate
one<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.470> my<00:02:38.620> dance<00:02:39.549> moves<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.180> created

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
one of my dance moves that I created

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.690 
one of my dance moves that I created
just<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.110> couple<00:02:41.290> years<00:02:41.410> ago<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.830> was<00:02:42.100> bored<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.810 
I was sommelier and I came up with a
little<00:02:46.390> dance<00:02:46.600> move<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> call<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.549> swirl
