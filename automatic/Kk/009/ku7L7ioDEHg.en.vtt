 The dripline is a pipe, generally in very resistant plastic material, equipped with special holes, through which it is possible to water plants, flowerbeds, vases. 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.450
 This tube is placed on the surface of the ground, placing the holes near the shafts of the trees, or of the seedlings 

00:00:58.532 --> 00:01:05.532
 special U-bolts allow the pipe to be fixed to the ground, so that it does not move accidentally, dispersing the water where it is not needed 

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:28.873
 to better irrigate the soil and the plants it is also possible to place special drippers inside the holes of the pipe 

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:32.207
 or even flexible tubes, so as to direct the water 

00:01:55.997 --> 00:02:03.000
 This pipe can also be placed underground; in this case you will practice a small trench a few centimeters deep, 

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:05.480
 that unites the areas of the garden we want to irrigate 

00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:15.110
 inside this trench the dripping wing is placed, with the holes near the plants that we want to water.
