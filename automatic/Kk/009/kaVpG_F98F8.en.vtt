00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.490
 so in this exercise we have to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 build symmetric 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.340
 two signs figure versus water 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.259
 but also in relation to the right of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.580
 there compared to the drug dea you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.770
 know more than it's symmetry 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.710
 axial of the sixth so me of the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.529
 do that build the symmetrical of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.500
 this figure with respect to the right that 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.180
 we remember we have to build 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.060
 the simi price of each point that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.309
 is the figure in relation to the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.340
 right and and for that I'm going to start 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.890
 by this point our to his the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 perpendicular to the right and and which 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 go through the point here so we're 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.989
 7.9 while the air you take here 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 your eye and Cairo 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.289
 and then you were initiated 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 perpendicular club then you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.730
 extend one so here or there you have 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 your perpendicular but you the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.520
 extend once you've drawn 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.740
 your particular case to those who pass 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.640
 by this point you take our pump to 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.729
 you sting at this point which is 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.280
 the intersection of your perpendicular 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:28.470
 right here 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.150
 with and you take the measurement here 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.440
 ma'am by the way my name is I'm going 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 put points because precisely 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.729
 famous block when I was away from me 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 am reminded to b and c 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 and then the intersection la pala pays 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 two years ago and easier you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.070
 so take the measure of the segment that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.049
 know that you're pointing to the other side 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.899
 and so this point there you call it by 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.910
 example its prices and so on you 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:00.530
 do the same for others 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:06.140
 points so perpendicular to the point a 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 particularly suffered the harbor and the point to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.619
 auch 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:17.970
 here you have your place that you 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.640
 post it knows the compares you 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.260
 click here you take the measure of what 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.700
 segment that you bring back from each other 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.959
 side is so here it'll give you 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:37.680
 your point prints and finally same thing 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:40.380
 for the weight of I'm going to take my 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.850
 other stone than a little longer so 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.630
 here up same thing but finally it's the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.079
 even right we understand each other 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.280
 leather peak mate takes the measure of the 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:01.920
 ib segment and we go back to the other side 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.420
 and so the second year and finally like 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.570
 you have here your point for 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.940
 deconstruct the stv sort of the figure by 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.859
 report to note that I'm going to do here in 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.890
 red 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:18.370
 so that's your site 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:21.660
 the first action that normally 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:30.400
 had to do that from the 6th station 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:31.959
 computer if she was kidding now but 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.670
 no we have to do the same thing but 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.950
 attention symmetry of the figure of 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.650
 departure from this is our 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.270
 central asymmetry chapter so here 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.720
 you have built to dugny right 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:50.820
 these waters were worth for others 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.820
 vacation realize the right half to water 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.600
 and finally the half right bo 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.170
 then take your time by yourself 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.579
 poke at the high point and then you take 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.530
 the measure for example for the point a 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.190
 so had it's black will you 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.919
 post here from an api so that 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.020
 it gives you to this world if you have the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.780
 same thing for the point it's you the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.840
 win I did not think I would 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.880
 finds its sources at 2000 right so 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.070
 here we report the 16 seconds and you 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.930
 do the same for the bay weight 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:47.790
 of that you're reporting here so here to you 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.200
 give seconds and so you have 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.860
 your new triangle that I'm going 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.860
 put here remp r 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.820
 so here is red you have the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.550
 symmetrical of this figure with respect to 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.840
 d and towards the symmetrical of this 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.420
 figure versus water 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.950
 here he knows will make me axial is here a 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.850
 mean central like that we see well 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.850
 the difference between prices
