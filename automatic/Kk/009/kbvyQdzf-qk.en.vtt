00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.960
 and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.520
 equal to all simple come kids 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.379
 new video up better until 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.090
 of each type this time we're going to talk about 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.949
 the best dragon type attacks 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.869
 logically there are many attacks of type 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.580
 dragon and 8 a chosen summary the most 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.170
 used and the most viewed and we will 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 explain it one by one and why are they so 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.359
 good ones 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.529
 let's apply the dragon type a type 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 that we love me at least 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.289
 love the dragon type is very used the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.269
 true that I also look pretty 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.339
 type dragons mega chavizar and dragon to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.079
 very much like dragon type are very 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.120
 very but very seen because they are very 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.739
 powerful have very good states and the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.359
 people not only include their equipment and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.370
 many of them are few favorites of 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.660
 the people so this time at the best 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 attack of each type let's see from the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.930
 Dragon - type attacks all through 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.460
 venice below are of damage 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 direct I will not say no dragon dance 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 or anything like that are all damage attacks 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.429
 direct first edil in physicists and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.660
 after the specials so let's go 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.760
 with the first dragon-type attack 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.890
 physical hit my our first attack 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.719
 physical dragon type this attack is very 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 peculiar because they only learn it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.379
 soroush and gaston by level then also 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.780
 can learn soft from the dream world 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.730
 when we launched in 2d white pokemon from 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.980
 wheat the auc also had bumps but 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.930
 of normal by level they only learn to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.150
 Cyrus and GarzÃ³n, what does this 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.250
 attack for 40 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.330
 without adding the state all the attacks 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.220
 that I'm going to put in hours do not have 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.600
 adding the staff are basic attacks 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.780
 of the base power according to the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.060
 attack power 40 and precision 90 but 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.310
 what effect does it have hits two 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.080
 Sometimes this allows you to break it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430
 you that is a skill that annoys 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.020
 a lot with is a very powerful attack 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.240
 and do not kill him and his rival can kill you 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.680
 to you and focus bands and we go with the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.660
 next physical moment of dragon type 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.420
 dragon claw this movement is more 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.730
 powerful hits the same with 80 power 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.290
 but it does not hit the same because 40 more is 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.180
 active maybe 40 more is hit bis 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.860
 removes more has more power than claw 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.020
 dragon but the agon claw is more 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.690
 safe precision fine though not 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.830
 effect side effect does not have 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.510
 none with can not hit twice 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.640
 does not push back the rival do not burn 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.590
 nothing the only thing he does is none 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.960
 a sure attack of tigua dragon very 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.090
 powerful because 480 more states would be 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.340
 120 but I'm adding the this power 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.590
 80 precision 100 safe physical attack of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.990
 kind of gone we're going up and we're going with 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.090
 more irritated dragon- like attack 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.950
 this attack has power 120 precision 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.570
 100 does not fail almost never has set the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.550
 power that you have and more being if you gave 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.490
 a brutal attack I will pay you 180 of 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.230
 power 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.390
 and it has a very side effect 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.240
 negative that is hit from two to three 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.070
 turns followed and confuses at the end of 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.560
 they save exceptions because they 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.000
 associations because it 's something that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.260
 imagine that you are angry 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 first shift but you were 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.620
 paralyzed if in the next turn it 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 realizes is not to confuse you 'aces' 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
 later or imagine that you hit in attack 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.800
 angry your opponent hits us an attack 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.300
 of recoil in the second shift not 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.190
 you confuse return zero, they put themselves 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.110
 made exceptions this attack 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.880
 is very powerful is the most used because the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.500
 people sometimes used the cannon more 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.480
 powerful and angry type of attack 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.850
 physical is the most powerful I have left of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.380
 side with the dragon charge dragon us 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.000
 are other attacks also dragon type 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.230
 physical but I think that the most 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.370
 important and the best are those that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.380
 just say the three that I just said 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.260
 to summarize it enough and now 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.630
 we go with the two most used attacks of 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.400
 dragon type but specials we go with 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.750
 them the first one is pulse dragons of 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.370
 Attack is the safest attack 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.140
 special dragon type because it has 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.640
 100 precision and effect in motion 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.410
 no dragon-type attacks that 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 I would beat is the rival with good a good 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.370
 power and if your pokemon is of type 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.320
 dragon you put it more the state hit and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.460
 it's very strong if it does not attack safely it 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.110
 it seems like a claw 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.030
 in physical movements but this is the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.440
 special and we are going dragon pulse and now 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.960
 we go with the best type attack of the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.300
 gong the most seen the most used and the most 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.650
 risky that is kite heist is that 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.480
 he is the most seen and most daring in the goal 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.430
 game attack very, very powerful 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
 powerful dragon- type attack and when 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.090
 those elements of assured combat 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.370
 whenever you come back you will receive a 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.830
 attack kite heist you have to have 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.810
 of good the power 130 more then the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.000
 staff your mariana with a very powerful 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.130
 program a fort of 195 without bad no 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.660
 calculation with the head and precision 90 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.730
 it may fail but it has an effect 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.620
 secondary very but that very harmful 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.480
 for you it is that you lose the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.800
 special attack or low two levels the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.270
 so special of the user what 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.730
 uses is when they have as imagined 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.680
 that they take out that the mainz and use as 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.030
 draco goal what would happen in that turn that 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.280
 you use commented with you stick a host 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.040
 bestial but you get off the special attack 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.540
 for two you are bound a little to change 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.910
 but a lot of people what they do is 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.380
 leave it with drake kite and comment here 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.510
 says draco and starts all the time 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.550
 we oppose comet robbery except losada 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.710
 hits almost everything for one and dragons 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.330
 Etcetera etcetera is very very 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.550
 but that very good attack and that most seen 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.630
 it's better to untie what dragon type 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.880
 to the attacks of the legendary 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.260
 logically so guys this has been 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.780
 agon type attacks the best 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.850
 you asked me many videos like this 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.010
 didactic to explain you and make you the 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.150
 game easier and I'm happy 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.920
 help them because that's why I became the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.630
 channel to help you and make the goal that 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.100
 it's more fun so guys thanks 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.639
 for being with me every day I send you a 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.620
 I want to hug you very much and bye

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.780
