00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 in the presentation of the new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.020
 New uniforms shirts had 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.809
 called the attention of the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.960
 pumas legaspi today finally in a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 event then already there with a lot of show with 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.190
 a lot of production although brief was 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.380
 presented the uniform of the cougars 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.170
 we go to this report of our 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 compañero adolfo díaz red 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.040
 emotional was the presentation of the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.560
 new skin that will wear the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.830
 university students during their matches 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.500
 the next league tournament mx what 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030
 more important are the players who 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 You must turn this shirt into 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.520
 historical remembering in guadalajara lion 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 there are many shirts of the bicampeonato that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 he keeps using people because he stays 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 marked by the championship when 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 let's hope to make history with this 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.320
 T-shirt for people to follow 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.750
 being in 10 years and that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820
 it's only done inside the court 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 between the green rectangle providing the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.159
 with pride and with much spirit of the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.470
 beauty in the design there is no discussion and 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.940
 of course I think that when one 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.040
 especially us the players 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 when we put we have put the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 shirt logo on the pumas shirt 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.930
 I think we try to do what 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.780
 best 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.250
 in each game leave everything and take 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.200
 results so that also the vision 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.210
 Enjoy that precisely for the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.940
 player it is important to know who will be 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 wearing the latest technology to 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.080
 sportswear that we are implementing 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.240
 something still much newer that's going 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.910
 towards the fiber precisely of the garment 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.950
 what is a dry is what it does is 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.750
 that dries much faster the garment 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.990
 and this makes it also a garment 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.819
 light even though it has many 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.679
 transfers and some added parts that 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.999
 they could make it look heavy on 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.460
 reality is a very light garment because 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.140
 fiber is a fiber that allows you to 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.659
 in the moment that transpires dries 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.270
 immediately and what none of the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.640
 college students must forget on the court 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.369
 in the gallery and on the street dress this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.150
 T-shirt is a pride but much more 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.690
 a responsibility that one 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.550
 I worked in university, I wore a garment 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.640
 the university is a responsibility and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.620
 find the find it with 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.990
 behavior with ethics with 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.360
 Professionalism with images of Miguel

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.170
