tremolo and reverse headstock but this
year<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.860> would<00:01:20.220> try<00:01:20.370> to<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.820> changes

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
year we would try to make some changes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940

so<00:01:21.660> basically<00:01:21.900> what<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.140> did<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.500> take<00:01:22.800> out

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so basically what we did was take out

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.070 
the tremolo I put it like a normal
bridge<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> normal

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
