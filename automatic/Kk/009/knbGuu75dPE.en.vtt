00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
or would be a 7 7 to 10 inch tablets or

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.050 
or would be a 7 7 to 10 inch tablets or
iPads<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.640> where<00:02:23.820> I'm<00:02:23.910> gonna

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
iPads right and this is where I'm gonna

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940 
iPads right and this is where I'm gonna
I'm<00:02:24.360> gonna<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.750> crank<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.350> feet<00:02:25.590> closer

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.350 
I'm gonna just crank the feet closer
together<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.850> would<00:02:27.030> work<00:02:27.150> better

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
together because that would work better

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.150 
together because that would work better
for<00:02:27.600> my<00:02:27.750> 8<00:02:28.020> whereas<00:02:28.350> if<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> do<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.740> 10<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
for my 8 whereas if you do the 10 you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.620 
for my 8 whereas if you do the 10 you
probably<00:02:29.430> want<00:02:29.610> them<00:02:29.760> cranked<00:02:30.150> farther<00:02:30.480> apart

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
probably want them cranked farther apart

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.820 
probably want them cranked farther apart
and<00:02:31.080> there<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.530> go

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
and there we go

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.010 
and there we go
perfect<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.460> sits<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.480> then

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
perfect it sits there like that and then

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.840 
perfect it sits there like that and then
you<00:02:34.140> crank<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> thing<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:35.340> high<00:02:35.610> as<00:02:35.640> you
