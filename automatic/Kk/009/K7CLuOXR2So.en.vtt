needs to be you can see the hole there
in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.559> piece<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.739> wood<00:00:58.920> where<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> rest<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
in the piece of wood where the rest of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
in the piece of wood where the rest of
the<00:01:01.109> cane<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.449> point<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.870> had

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the cane will go at this point I had

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.130 
the cane will go at this point I had
already<00:01:04.140> turned<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> other<00:01:06.180> part

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
already turned the other the other part

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.260 
already turned the other the other part
of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> cane<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.040> thought<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:09.180> all

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
of the cane I just thought that you all

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
of the cane I just thought that you all
might<00:01:09.450> enjoy<00:01:10.460> launching<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> process<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
might enjoy launching the process so

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.250 
might enjoy launching the process so
this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> cane

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this is actually going to be a cane

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.539 
this is actually going to be a cane
handle<00:01:14.479> for<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> guy<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.310> spinning

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
handle for that guy so I'm just spinning

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
handle for that guy so I'm just spinning
it<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.060> sure<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.420> I'm<00:01:18.689> gonna<00:01:18.869> hit<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
it to make sure that I'm gonna hit the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
it to make sure that I'm gonna hit the
rest<00:01:19.409> while<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> turns<00:01:19.979> on

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
rest while it turns on

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.790 
rest while it turns on
right<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.900> using<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.410> roughing

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
right now I'm just using a roughing

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.300 
right now I'm just using a roughing
gouge<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:24.170> just<00:01:25.170> round<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.980> entire<00:01:26.310> piece

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
gouge to just round out the entire piece

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
gouge to just round out the entire piece
it's<00:01:29.310> usually<00:01:29.460> good<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.990> low

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it's usually good to go at a really low

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.260 
it's usually good to go at a really low
speed<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.820> helps<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.840> prevent<00:01:34.640> chip<00:01:35.640> out

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.140 

that's<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.350> parting<00:01:40.710> tool<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> caliper

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that's just parting tool in the caliper

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150 
that's just parting tool in the caliper
I'm<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.810> using<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
I'm just using it to get it down to the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.800 
I'm just using it to get it down to the
right<00:01:44.280> size<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.240> back<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
right size and then I go back with the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.290 
right size and then I go back with the
roughing<00:01:46.140> gouge<00:01:46.170> again<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.970> size

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
roughing gouge again to get to that size

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.100 
roughing gouge again to get to that size
that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> want<00:01:50.090> kind<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.120> just<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.390> process<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that I want kind of just a process of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.210 
that I want kind of just a process of
getting<00:01:52.229> lower<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> lower<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> rounded<00:01:56.190> the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
getting lower and lower and rounded the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.219 
getting lower and lower and rounded the
piece<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> wood<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
piece of wood more and more there's the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.060 
piece of wood more and more there's the
old<00:01:58.380> Cape<00:01:59.540> that<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> guy<00:02:01.290> broke<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.860> just

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
old Cape that that the guy broke up just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.100 
old Cape that that the guy broke up just
flip<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.700> pencil<00:02:03.090> marks<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> can

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
flip the pencil marks on there so I can

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.620 
flip the pencil marks on there so I can
get<00:02:04.229> into<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.710> size<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.310> well

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.080 

it's<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.500> process<00:02:08.740> using<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.520> lathe<00:02:09.700> there's<00:02:10.000> a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
it's a process using a lathe there's a
