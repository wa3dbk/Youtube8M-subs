00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
to do is you can have 10 you can have

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.969 
to do is you can have 10 you can have
let's<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.689> could<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.899> 10<00:01:40.170> sets<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
let's see you could have 10 sets of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.969 
let's see you could have 10 sets of
classes<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.270> five<00:01:42.509> classes<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> each<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.649> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
classes with five classes in each if you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.700 
classes with five classes in each if you
decide<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.670> prestige<00:01:45.180> you'll<00:01:45.930> end<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.289> having

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
decide to prestige you'll end up having

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
decide to prestige you'll end up having
ten<00:01:47.310> sets<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:48.450> ten<00:01:49.109> classes<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
ten sets with ten classes so this is

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.219 
ten sets with ten classes so this is
what<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.289> have<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:54.149> 10<00:01:54.689> sets<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
what I have right now I have 10 sets of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
what I have right now I have 10 sets of
classes<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:57.049> five<00:01:58.049> sets<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.590> each<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.270> have

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
that I have and this is why I decided to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.479 
that I have and this is why I decided to
go<00:03:07.900> ahead<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.260> purchase<00:03:08.409> all<00:03:08.799> these<00:03:08.980> classes

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
go ahead and purchase all these classes

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.300 
go ahead and purchase all these classes
because<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.239> allows<00:03:10.510> me<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.109> set<00:03:11.920> up<00:03:11.950> multiple

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
because it allows me to set up multiple

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.190 
because it allows me to set up multiple
types<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.939> classes<00:03:13.299> for<00:03:13.480> multiple<00:03:13.840> types<00:03:14.019> of

me to be able to adapt to any situation

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.279 
me to be able to adapt to any situation
one<00:05:33.139> thing<00:05:33.440> if<00:05:33.650> you're<00:05:34.069> in<00:05:34.279> game<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:36.110> want

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
one thing if you're in game and you want

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.350 
one thing if you're in game and you want
to<00:05:36.379> be<00:05:36.440> able<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.770> use<00:05:36.949> this<00:05:37.159> you<00:05:37.759> can't<00:05:38.029> switch

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
to be able to use this you can't switch

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.570 
to be able to use this you can't switch
in<00:05:38.569> between<00:05:38.629> these<00:05:39.199> classes<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.919> game<00:05:40.279> which

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
in between these classes in game which

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.339 
in between these classes in game which
is<00:05:40.610> very<00:05:40.940> very<00:05:41.150> annoying<00:05:41.569> I<00:05:41.930> don't<00:05:42.110> know<00:05:42.229> if

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
is very very annoying I don't know if

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:43.959 
is very very annoying I don't know if
they<00:05:42.469> can<00:05:42.529> patch<00:05:42.860> that<00:05:43.159> I<00:05:43.339> doubt<00:05:43.639> that<00:05:43.849> they

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
they can patch that I doubt that they

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.519 
they can patch that I doubt that they
will<00:05:44.120> be<00:05:44.180> able<00:05:44.300> to<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:45.020> doubt<00:05:45.229> that<00:05:45.409> they

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
will be able to and I doubt that they

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:46.689 
will be able to and I doubt that they
will<00:05:45.710> patch<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.129> because<00:05:46.400> they<00:05:46.550> haven't

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
will patch it because they haven't

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.999 
will patch it because they haven't
patched<00:05:46.969> anything<00:05:47.120> else<00:05:47.690> with<00:05:47.870> this<00:05:47.990> game<00:05:48.229> but

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
patched anything else with this game but

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.430 
patched anything else with this game but
my<00:05:49.159> point<00:05:49.400> is<00:05:49.520> you<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:50.300> have<00:05:50.509> to<00:05:50.750> set<00:05:51.110> this

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
my point is you you have to set this

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.890 
my point is you you have to set this
tier<00:05:51.889> like<00:05:52.550> if<00:05:52.699> you<00:05:52.849> like<00:05:53.120> you<00:05:53.360> control<00:05:53.750> this

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
tier like if you like you control this

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.290 
tier like if you like you control this
by<00:05:54.080> doing<00:05:54.139> your<00:05:54.379> lb<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:54.949> your<00:05:55.099> RB<00:05:55.460> if<00:05:55.699> you<00:05:56.120> don't

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
by doing your lb in your RB if you don't

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.749 
by doing your lb in your RB if you don't
do<00:05:56.419> lb<00:05:56.839> and<00:05:57.080> RB<00:05:57.500> or<00:05:57.710> if<00:05:57.979> you<00:05:58.129> don't<00:05:58.310> pick<00:05:58.550> the

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
do lb and RB or if you don't pick the

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.850 
do lb and RB or if you don't pick the
specific<00:05:59.300> tier<00:05:59.599> that<00:06:00.110> you<00:06:00.259> want<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.589> use

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
specific tier that you want to use

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.890 
specific tier that you want to use
you're<00:06:01.669> stuck<00:06:02.000> with<00:06:02.210> it's<00:06:02.360> here<00:06:02.509> that<00:06:02.539> you<00:06:02.750> may

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
not want to use in game so that means

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.309 
not want to use in game so that means
