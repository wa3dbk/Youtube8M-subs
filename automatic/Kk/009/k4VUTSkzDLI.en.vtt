00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
holding on to a three point lead

a<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:38.730> lead<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.540> bout

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
a three point lead but the way this bout

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.720 
a three point lead but the way this bout
is<00:00:39.809> gone<00:00:40.140> could<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.649> significant

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.860 

just<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.880> they're<00:00:48.030> both<00:00:48.300> running<00:00:48.630> out<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
just like they're both running out of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.130 
just like they're both running out of
gas<00:00:49.080> now<00:00:49.410> they're<00:00:49.560> taking<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.920> point<00:00:50.190> away

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
gas now they're taking a point away

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
gas now they're taking a point away
taking<00:00:52.140> two<00:00:52.290> points<00:00:52.680> away<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:52.920> carry<00:00:53.370> on

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
taking two points away from carry on

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
taking two points away from carry on
carry<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.450> had<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> three<00:00:55.140> point<00:00:55.410> lead<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
carry on had a three point lead but the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.710 
carry on had a three point lead but the
math<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.880> that<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.090> point<00:00:57.360> taken

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
math on this is that the point taken

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.299 
math on this is that the point taken
away<00:00:57.900> from<00:00:58.080> one<00:00:58.260> fighter<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.650> awarded<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.130> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
away from one fighter is awarded to the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.610 
away from one fighter is awarded to the
other<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.700> it's<00:00:59.880> a<00:00:59.970> two<00:01:00.150> point<00:01:00.390> swing<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> now

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
other so it's a two point swing and now

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
other so it's a two point swing and now
we're<00:01:01.860> tied<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.160> 20<00:01:02.870> see<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.050> is<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.350> I'm

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
