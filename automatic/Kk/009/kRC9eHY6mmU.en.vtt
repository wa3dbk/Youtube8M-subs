00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
both sort of slightly pliable rubber and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.259 
both sort of slightly pliable rubber and
then<00:04:16.209> they<00:04:16.329> have<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.739> full<00:04:18.070> collar<00:04:18.700> piece<00:04:19.030> and

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
then they have the full collar piece and

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.789 
then they have the full collar piece and
then<00:04:19.389> the<00:04:19.510> half<00:04:19.720> collar<00:04:20.049> piece<00:04:20.320> for<00:04:20.650> the

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
then the half collar piece for the

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.540 
then the half collar piece for the
folded<00:04:21.280> arms<00:04:21.489> they<00:04:22.180> look<00:04:22.330> basically<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.260> same

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
folded arms they look basically the same

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.700 
folded arms they look basically the same
and<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.760> think<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:25.090> shading<00:04:25.510> on<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.690> sdcc<00:04:26.470> one

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
and I think the shading on the sdcc one

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.620 
and I think the shading on the sdcc one
which<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.669> one<00:04:27.789> on<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.150> side<00:04:28.360> over<00:04:28.510> here

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
which is the one on this side over here

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.290 
which is the one on this side over here
it's<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.650> little<00:04:29.860> bit<00:04:30.400> darker<00:04:30.820> but<00:04:30.940> other<00:04:31.120> than

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
it's a little bit darker but other than

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.150 
it's a little bit darker but other than
that<00:04:31.360> they<00:04:31.660> look<00:04:31.840> basically<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.380> same<00:04:32.620> now

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
that they look basically the same now

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.500 
that they look basically the same now
that<00:04:33.370> about<00:04:33.580> wraps<00:04:33.760> up<00:04:33.910> for<00:04:34.150> both<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.450> the
