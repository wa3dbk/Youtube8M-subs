for the K 1600 GT and GTL it's actually

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.800 
for the K 1600 GT and GTL it's actually
quite<00:00:18.010> simple<00:00:18.400> on<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:18.880> inside<00:00:19.300> of<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.599> bar

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
quite simple on the inside of the bar

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.680 
quite simple on the inside of the bar
there<00:00:20.140> are<00:00:20.340> seven<00:00:21.340> adjuster<00:00:22.150> holes<00:00:22.390> that<00:00:22.630> you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
there are seven adjuster holes that you

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.590 
there are seven adjuster holes that you
can<00:00:22.840> choose<00:00:23.230> from<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.640> clamp<00:00:24.970> has<00:00:25.119> a<00:00:25.300> dowel

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
can choose from the clamp has a dowel

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.830 
can choose from the clamp has a dowel
pin<00:00:26.020> in<00:00:26.199> it<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:27.610> that<00:00:27.760> way<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.029> can<00:00:28.420> adjust

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
pin in it and that way you can adjust

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.720 
pin in it and that way you can adjust
the<00:00:29.529> length<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:30.010> the<00:00:31.739> mounting<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:33.190> suit<00:00:33.430> your

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
the length of the mounting to suit your

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:58.090 
the length of the mounting to suit your
inseam<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:36.179> we'll<00:00:37.179> find<00:00:37.479> a<00:00:37.569> hole<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:37.989> like
