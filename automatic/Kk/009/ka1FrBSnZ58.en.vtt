00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi there, Iâ€™m admin group mask sat down and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.790
 Now I would like to show you this 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.240
 here is the mask this mask is a pirate station 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.349
 the work was custom made 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 The feature of this mask is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:27.199
 what we have backlit here is inserted and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 batteries and turn on the backlight 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 backlight color can be any in this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.820
 case we made a green one like this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.309
 it all works 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 the mask is very light despite the fact that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.570
 There are batteries and some kind of minimum 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.980
 electronics but only LEDs 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.770
 comfortable and lightweight mesh fabrics here 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.350
 below the grid is also made to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.260
 it could be worn long and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 well, my face is not misted in it now I 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.640
 I'll show you how she looks on her face 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.840
 here and so the mask looks on the face 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.380
 Now for example, I will wear headphones like 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.119
 This is done on original pictures with 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 pirate station I do not have Belov 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.729
 Headphones These are black headphones 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.060
 certainly not so cool looks here 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.740
 but to represent that all this together 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.490
 here creates this image 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.770
 well, something like that there of course 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.939
 headphone bow abruptly but I only 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.939
 there are no others 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.710
 masks can shake her head she doesn't 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:05.149
 flies and no breathe thanks to 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.000
 that there are many air slots and he 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.569
 quietly passes generally I tried in 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.879
 it is long enough and convenient 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.090
 comfortable means mounting the mask 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.819
 five-point 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.010
 here is such a complex here 5 rubber bands 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.730
 which are regulated here such 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.030
 fasteners ki 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 which he just twists and very 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.290
 conveniently mounted and here here 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.269
 soft lining on the back 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.329
 which is adjacent to the back of the head and allows 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:46.129
 very firmly fixed very securely 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:48.489
 mask inside the battery compartment into two 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.739
 finger-type batteries and soft lining 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.280
 which is in contact with the forehead and 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.600
 allows you to adjust the height of Moscow and 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.209
 the most convenient and well wear a mask 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.709
 made of hard plastic like everything 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:11.209
 my masks are painted in this case white 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.560
 enamel that's basically all i wanted 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.560

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.979
 No, that is, well, since I do it myself 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.989
 it is possible to make an individual order 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.830
