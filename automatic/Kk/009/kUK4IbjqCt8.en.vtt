 throttle cleaner 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 rang choke valve from liquidate moth it 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 specially active solvent 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.939
 cleaning agents in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.579
 intake and throttle areas 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.710
 about internal combustion engine rise 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.829
 applications do not require dismantling 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.880
 throttle valves 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.880
 fast and efficient cleaning 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.399
 spray on contaminated 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:42.179
 non-working parts at intervals 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.190
 in two three seconds let it work 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:49.050
 liqui throttle cleaner 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.019
 moli 2 3 minutes and then start 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.420
 engine and at medium revs again 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.550
 extensive spray medium with short 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.550
 intervals for the entire launch area 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.049
 move for this probe in the inlet 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.450
 channel forward backward under extreme 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.450
 contamination repeat cleaning process 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.650
 here is the difference between polluted 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 throttle and throttle 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.620
 damper after treatment with a cleaner from 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.620
 liquidate moth 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.510
 thanks to this you save your 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.140
 Customers moving parts in good order 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.670
 able to reduce fuel consumption and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.090
 provide both plans and a uniform course 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090
 engine 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.750
 throttle cleaner from liquidation 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.680
 moth reliably removes oil pitch and 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.140
 other fatty pollution he 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.100
 simultaneously also cleans the nozzles and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.700
 Internal parts will clean and throttle 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.210
 damper 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.439
 from liquidation moth is also suitable for cleaning 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.840
 catalyst liquidate moth to preserve 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.539
 technical condition and appearance 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.539
 your car is all from one source
