so the first step is we're gonna mount

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.240 
so the first step is we're gonna mount
the<00:00:38.670> bracket<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.660> quick<00:00:39.930> tip<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.890> sure<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the bracket one quick tip make sure that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
the bracket one quick tip make sure that
the<00:00:41.399> spring<00:00:41.640> lock<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.180> facing<00:00:42.660> forward<00:00:42.989> when

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the spring lock is facing forward when

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
the spring lock is facing forward when
you<00:00:43.950> mount<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.250> bracket<00:00:44.840> whether<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.020> have

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
an outside or an inside mount the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.479 
an outside or an inside mount the
mounting<00:00:49.410> bracket<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.920> gonna<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> same

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
mounting bracket is gonna be the same

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
mounting bracket is gonna be the same
now<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:51.600> brackets<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> size<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
now I have two brackets for the size of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
now I have two brackets for the size of
my<00:00:53.010> blind<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.059> blind<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.719> much

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
my blind but if you're blind is much

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
my blind but if you're blind is much
larger<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.500> may<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.829> three<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> first

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
larger you may have three so the first

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.400 
larger you may have three so the first
step<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.690> we're<00:00:57.809> gonna<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.079> ahead<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.289> we're
