00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 when all of us who are in 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.410
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 let's see a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.050
 mod a quite useful way and that is that we 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.030
 allows to have all the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
 minecraft tools with the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 crafting table or table enchantments 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.699
 in a single block and transportable this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 time the title but good first 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.590
 we have to make several blocks first 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.160
 we must do an inter is already mont that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.050
 It's a diamond with four -between perls 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.720
 We have to do with presi books self 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.329
 this one that is all bookstores like 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 bookstores so compressed a little weird and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.410
 then we have to do this portable 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 core this weird that is I have a table 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.059
 enchantment crafting table two 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.600
 bookstores of these tablets or as 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.879
 be an anvil join der chest and a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.829
 diamond of these rare glasses that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.629
 we have seen and with that we have the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.219
 portable core and now with this 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.090
 we just have to put it with two 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.610
 sticks the portable core this and is very 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.150
 cool uncle corin we right click 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.900
 not only this menu for example I want 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.330
 create three heads 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.140
 Interior kraft the same for the table 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.240
 enchantment unam bill and an under 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.090
 cheste is good the under set is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 super cool dude the only bad thing I'm 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 seeing is that we click right by 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.240
 example lara in sant 'tablet' is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.340
 testing now and you see it does not come out of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 level 30 or anything like that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.359
 it's the only thing used in bookstores but 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.259
 level 5 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.789
 novak vaquita takes and then we have this 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.490
 here remote pad but first we have 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.030
 to do the copper remote that is with a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.100
 under diamond of these a diamond with 4 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.990
 under tels 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.959
 we make understand diamond we have with 4 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.299
 of iron and 4 gold the remote core that 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.159
 we put it with two sticks and we see the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.229
 remote blog this is quite useful 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.149
 also and is that to a chest for example 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.149
 this we do shift right click 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.420
 and now with this hand if we make it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.420
 right click 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.050
 and we can go to the mine for example and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.440
 we want here a chest for example if 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.760
 we have a chest only for hostels 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.580
 let's put the envelopes here and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.890
 arranged and that chest there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.480
 because there will be no distance and then 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.450
 we also have this that I suppose is 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.980
 for servers I guess it's a 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.780
 sort of padlock that is made as 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.260
 you are seeing as if it were a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.480
 iron boat and one up 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.840
 and it's kind of weird that we give him click 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.280
 right no longer shift and right click that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.799
 this serves to remove this chest for 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.340
 example and also to block it with the 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.739
 padlock this text is locked is already 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.940
 what you dot the magnet so I guess 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.730
 that this is so that nobody else can 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.430
 use is pretty cool uncle and for 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.490
 remove it as ' god shift right click and 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:04.520
 remove connection for example and you're 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:04.520
 3 the truth is that it's cool 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.160
 all this I love the super useful but 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.350
 now you have the link to the description 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.490
 is for 1.7 point 10 and 1 point 7.2 is 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.490
 install with forge and so on 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.350
 bye
