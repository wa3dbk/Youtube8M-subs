00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
really why we sort of went with sort of

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.250 
really why we sort of went with sort of
this<00:00:57.280> kind<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.520> Vietnam<00:00:58.000> ask<00:00:58.270> types<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:59.020> and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
this kind of Vietnam ask types of and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.080 
this kind of Vietnam ask types of and
weaponry<00:00:59.739> that<00:00:59.860> everything<00:01:00.550> is<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.670> ballistics

pull<00:03:52.310> off<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:52.639> better<00:03:52.880> make<00:03:52.940> sure<00:03:53.090> that

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
pull off and you better make sure that

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.700 
pull off and you better make sure that
the<00:03:53.510> area<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:53.750> clear<00:03:53.930> before<00:03:54.169> you<00:03:54.380> show<00:03:54.560> up

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.780 

here's<00:04:00.710> one<00:04:00.920> when<00:04:01.070> two<00:04:01.220> players<00:04:01.460> would<00:04:01.640> come

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
here's one when two players would come

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.980 
here's one when two players would come
at<00:04:01.880> each<00:04:02.000> other<00:04:02.150> with<00:04:02.270> chainsaws<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.900> was

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
at each other with chainsaws it was

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.390 
at each other with chainsaws it was
pretty<00:04:03.170> much<00:04:03.290> for<00:04:03.410> random<00:04:03.710> outcome<00:04:04.010> as<00:04:04.130> far<00:04:04.310> as

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
pretty much for random outcome as far as

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.240 
pretty much for random outcome as far as
who<00:04:04.520> would<00:04:04.670> win<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:06.200> here's<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.860> we<00:04:06.980> actually

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
who would win and here's to we actually

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.460 
who would win and here's to we actually
wanted<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.520> make<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.910> very<00:04:08.570> cinematic<00:04:09.080> and

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
wanted to make it a very cinematic and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.200 
wanted to make it a very cinematic and
be<00:04:09.770> have<00:04:10.070> an<00:04:10.160> actual<00:04:10.310> game<00:04:10.610> mechanic<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.030> was

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
be have an actual game mechanic that was

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.550 
be have an actual game mechanic that was
implemented<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:14.480> bottom<00:04:14.750> line<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.020> when<00:04:15.170> two

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
implemented the bottom line is when two

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.199 
implemented the bottom line is when two
characters<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.190> gears<00:04:16.340> engage<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> chance

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
characters and gears engage and a chance

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.979 
characters and gears engage and a chance
that<00:04:17.359> lasted<00:04:18.080> be<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.380> scoop<00:04:18.739> two<00:04:19.280> seconds

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
that lasted be a scoop two seconds

that lasted be a scoop two seconds
sparks<00:04:20.989> are<00:04:21.109> flying<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.650> know<00:04:21.739> they<00:04:21.859> grounded

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
sparks are flying you know they grounded

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190 
sparks are flying you know they grounded
and<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:22.670> it's<00:04:22.880> over<00:04:23.000> like<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.900> know<00:04:23.960> all<00:04:23.990> we

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
and then it's over like you know all we

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.450 
and then it's over like you know all we
basically<00:04:24.410> have<00:04:24.590> time<00:04:24.770> for<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.310> quick

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
basically have time for is just a quick

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.980 
basically have time for is just a quick
button<00:04:25.730> mash<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.210> let's<00:04:26.450> see<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.750> know<00:04:26.840> how

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
button mash so let's see you know how

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.870 
button mash so let's see you know how
many<00:04:27.410> times<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.770> person<00:04:27.890> could<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.280> be<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.700> then

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
many times a person could it be and then

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.820 
many times a person could it be and then
whoever<00:04:29.570> wins<00:04:29.870> wins<00:04:32.980> one<00:04:33.980> word<00:04:34.370> blood<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.770> a

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
whoever wins wins one word blood is a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.980 
whoever wins wins one word blood is a
bigger<00:04:37.130> game<00:04:37.430> it's<00:04:37.940> just<00:04:38.270> bigger<00:04:38.600> scope

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
bigger game it's just bigger scope

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.890 
bigger game it's just bigger scope
larger<00:04:39.590> creatures<00:04:40.040> more<00:04:40.310> epic<00:04:40.640> scale<00:04:40.940> etc<00:04:41.510> and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
larger creatures more epic scale etc and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.270 
larger creatures more epic scale etc and
we<00:04:41.990> want<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.230> make<00:04:42.350> sure<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.100> player

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
we want to make sure that the player

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.100 
we want to make sure that the player
still<00:04:43.580> feels<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:43.910> what<00:04:44.180> he's<00:04:44.300> doing<00:04:44.330> in<00:04:44.960> this

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
still feels like what he's doing in this

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.440 
still feels like what he's doing in this
universe<00:04:45.470> matters<00:04:45.950> nothing<00:04:46.550> says<00:04:46.790> I'm<00:04:47.240> doing

universe matters nothing says I'm doing

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.210 
universe matters nothing says I'm doing
damage<00:04:47.780> more<00:04:48.140> than<00:04:48.410> just<00:04:48.770> seeing<00:04:48.950> a<00:04:49.010> blood

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
damage more than just seeing a blood

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.980 
damage more than just seeing a blood
effective<00:04:49.580> him<00:04:49.700> off<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:49.850> them<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.600> so<00:04:50.780> we've

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
effective him off of them and so we've

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.180 
effective him off of them and so we've
been<00:04:51.080> doing<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.500> even<00:04:51.860> our<00:04:51.950> bigger

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
been doing that even our bigger
