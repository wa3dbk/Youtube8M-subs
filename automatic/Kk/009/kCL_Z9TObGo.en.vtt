00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.640
 you are too often the company's products 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.640
 Sergie types are on my channel 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.840
 will be just one of those cases 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.830
 your story is not that pretty 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.070
 interesting very charismatic knife 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.700
 sirketi crawford casper and today 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.020
 discuss his whale so positive and 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.280
 may not be very positive 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.860
 sides of a big talk in this knife 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 let's start traditionally 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.800
 performance characteristics as 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.059
 can see the length of the knife in the open 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.280
 condition is a little more 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.219
 twenty three centimeters in length 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.320
 blade nine and a half centimeters 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.090
 a lie big enough let's compare 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 Salon as we can see the form produces 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.710
 such an impression 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.350
 pretty fat knife and heavy knife 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.490
 it weighs more than 200 grams that is it 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.620
 one of these controversial moments probably with 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.380
 the other side of the knife is positioned as 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.540
 such a self defense knife tactical if 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.579
 can put it that way 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.200
 so in general, this mechanism 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.829
 torture from my point of view weight him 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 excusably 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.409
 on the other hand, well, why put on 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.290
 knife is such a spacer but by golly but here 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.869
 ng not less than 30 i can be 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.799
 even more then there is such a healthy 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.329
 thick plate closing structure 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.479
 Well, of course not the liners shot that 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.640
 have it not even discussed liner 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.670
 pretty thick order of millimeter 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.979
 each one is the construction strength here 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.509
 have someone else have this one here is not the best la 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.149
 comes here to the forefront of the heel 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.670
 blade and it is still an additional way 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.189
 can be blocked ie here 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.369
 fuse lever that is when 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.579
 on the fuses we liner 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.200
 We will not be able to overcome that is to say in general that's 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.479
 this state can be done 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.820
 literally anything and he 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.410
 it is certain that the blade does not work out for you 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.720
 can be opened with installed on 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.470
 his bilateral bumblebees opens 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.620
 quite simply fast so still kin 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.510
 no extra brush movement well and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.909
 has a rather smooth ride when 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.349
 in the absence of backlash most likely will not 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.860
 this is seen on this is achieved by 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.540
 two thorns from two sides on one of 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.069
 each is worth one side of us tour 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.790
 washer on the other hand 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.170
 from non-ferrous metal lining material on 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.349
 the handle is plastic here 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.220
 than plastic with virtually no texture 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.860
 unity texture here this logo 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.500
 sirketi companies 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:57.379
 you all fastens these plastic lining 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.040
 using seo screw and it turns out 5 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.040
 torx 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.230
 the same situation we have with the other hand 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.650
 here we have a hole under 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.590
 lanyard 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.840
 it goes through the spacer again 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.629
 it will be easy to cook about court but rather 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.540
 narrow but notice i.e. double 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.030
 paracord here you definitely do not squeeze 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.840
 clip only in one position and only 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.030
 on one side 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.400
 that is, this knife we ​​will just 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.980
 doomed we have and gave 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.750
 Yes, in general, it is so you specifically 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.769
 for me further about the blade is it 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.120
 us such an interesting drop point with such 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.530
 pronounced fake blade and descents 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.970
 here somewhere from 1 3 blade width 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.010
 the thickness of the blade is quite so 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.000
 inspiring then here more than three 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.590
 millimeters and probably the first such 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.329
 a serious disadvantage of this knife is 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.590
 the steel that is used on the blade is 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.690
 aus 6m steel is not the most successful here if I 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.959
 honestly dont still salmon and but 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.160
 anal 6 m even easier will be well and the main 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.310
 controversial point of this knife 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.919
 this is his ergonomics let's first 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.930
 let's talk about the pros because the first thing 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.340
 really impressive this is how this 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.849
 the knife falls into the hand like this 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.440
 fencing grip that is basically 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.210
 impresses those feelings that 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.500
 experiencing the index finger not 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.860
 look at what is left here 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.789
 such marks on the liner 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.130
 planets well protrudes from under 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.129
 lining but here is some discomfort 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.499
 not 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.009
 eggs perhaps this contributes to such 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:39.689
 thick enough handle well that's when 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.800
 put here point finger tattoo 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.599
 subdued notch 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.309
 it feels like you're holding 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.349
 can not some firearms 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.659
 that is, he falls here like in 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.610
 trigger guard 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.399
 very interesting sensation and juan de sad 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.110
 very comfortable in this place plus here 

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.259
 such stability grip contributes 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.169
 Here is the influx of little finger that will interfere 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.959
 This situation even express for which 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.189
 it will be possible to catch the little finger and 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:08.149
 additionally strengthen your move 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:11.249
 but this very fuse is 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:14.309
 the worst is just what's in that knife 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:16.740
 and the first thing I would do if this 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:19.499
 knife acquired for himself and this is another 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.959
 release heading you sent my goal and 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.559
 so here I would draw a fuse senate 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:27.240
 because he is not needed firstly 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:28.800
 due to the fact that the liner is quite thick 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.110
 I go quite normal 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.269
 I doubt that he is in principle somehow 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.449
 slips off even if you hit the butt 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:37.860
 table so here is this flight fuse 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.800
 it is located just there somewhere 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.110
 invest your finger and it's just some 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.909
 nightmare because well you understand yes kuan 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.129
 pressure exerts pressure on the pad 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.689
 the thumb is thereby very simple 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.399
 unifies all these here 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.979
 positive emotions that you experience 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.409
 here is the retention of this knife here 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.209
 It is located notches on which beauty 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.550
 the finger should go that is 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.259
 implies that in this phonetic 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.169
 the finger should rest in this way 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:07.110
 keep it on but 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.539
 it's so uncomfortable for him to say this 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.249
 that the very first very first case when in 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.379
 This knife fell into my hand I would take off 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.209
 it come right away that is without 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.029
 any fluctuations of ordinary 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:20.339
 Well, summing up this review I can 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:23.279
 say i built this knife 6 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:25.319
 points that is just 2 points I would 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.169
 removed for the material of the blade 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.779
 rather weak rack and this one 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.919
 absolutely inappropriate here as well 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.689
 not appropriately located 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.579
 fuse by the way speaking if you 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:38.039
 done to everyone like hey ho 

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:41.009
 or fixing would be much more 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.930
 convenient do not forget to evaluate the knife 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.520
 comments on a ten-point scale 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.840
 I hope you were interested thank you all 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.840
 for watching luck and bye 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.130
 Well
