 from 5 and 30 in the morning over 500 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
 men of the public force and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.280
 human rights defenders arrived 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.500
 to the municipality of buriticá with the 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.300
 order to evict about 4000 miners who 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.390
 they settled informally in the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.700
 area we are doing a whole process of 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.370
 sensitization because here what 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.470
 prevails is human life and that's what 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.329
 what are we making you realize in 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.910
 all the citizens that at this moment 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.160
 are in our municipality on 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.730
 everything in the sector of the seats area 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.730
 sector san antonio 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.670
 the access road to the municipality remains 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.649
 closed by esmad staff to the place 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.600
 the transit of vehicles is prohibited 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.670
 that generated the agglomeration of hundreds of 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.500
 miners on the national road who 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.530
 they interrupted the vehicular passage towards 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.020
 Uraba for 30 minutes raising one 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.970
 voice of protest after nothing else we want 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.440
 let us work and we already ask 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.820
 to the government that if they do not want to act on us 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.180
 then give us solutions for employment 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.130
 Let's see what we can do 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.570
 in order to control mining 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.330
 illegal through the decree of 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.240
 public calamity 089 of October 19 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.830
 of 2013 it was declared as high zone 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.410
 risk the path the seats and the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.630
 sectors sant ramon peñitas san antonio 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.880
 and the jets forbidding everything 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.550
 type of gold exploitation east 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.440
 displacement of these people to each 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.080
 one of the places of origin does not have 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.690
 one more connotation but to evacuate a 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 little the social chaos that in that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.340
 moment exists in the critical municipality 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.140
 although the departmental government offers 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.250
 humanitarian aid to those who return to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.410
 their places of origin 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.600
 voluntary and those who are mostly 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.670
 from the northeast of Antioquia on their part 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.040

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 tica can not afford not going to marc 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.910
 evolution gives us no if we do not look to see 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.890
 how do we solve this we some 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.170
 thing we have that today the great 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.270
 The miners' concern is not knowing 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.580
 of what they are going to live because they assure that what 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.580
 The only thing they know how to do is to exploit the gold
