00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello welcome to this video tutorial 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.480
 how to make a garland to decorate 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.029
 your parties and make them as 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.730
 precious possible to do these 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 garlands we need something very simple 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.510
 the colored paper you can choose the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 that you want glue stick 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 a driller and thread of different 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.059
 colors can be blue pink white 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.910
 depending on how you are going to 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.649
 organize your party and simply 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.060
 a little patience to organize it 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.040
 let's go to it 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.330
 we started with the first 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.210
 hopefully we have to double by way of 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.130
 accordion there are different ways to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.200
 fold it but I advise you to 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.210
 that all of you 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.640
 fold you start folding the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.410
 half the folios you can choose the ones 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.530
 different sizes this is half of 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.820
 a din a4 is worth depending on the size that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.030
 make you choose and so the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.890
 garland yes good the main thing is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.850
 fold it in half to make a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.650
 accordion as accurate as possible once 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.550
 that we have folded in half we do 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.230
 another fold guiding us through the guide in 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.430
 medium 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.430
 and on the other side 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.290
 we make another double 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.290
 you see we keep doing 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.240
 another fold on this side 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.899
 and on this other side of here 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.010
 another one equal 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.920
 once we have this aspect you 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.410
 we turn around and guide us through the guide 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.410
 in the middle we turn again to bend 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.560
 always press hard so that you 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.660
 stay as firm as possible jce tour and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.250
 guiding the guide always in the middle 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.370
 come back again to bend 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.340
 in this way what we get when 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.620
 we take all the folds is an aspect 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.620
 of accordion you see 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.260
 once we have doubled it from this 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:40.470
 way we go back to making a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.470
 fold through the middle this way 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.480
 fold it and tighten it well 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.140
 You have to do this process with 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.330
 all the papers in this case we have 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.380
 chosen a red color we have it here 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.920
 the green the white and the yellow what 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.900
 we will do it with everyone 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.880
 once we have doubled all 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.580
 papers in the same way always in 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.130
 accordion shape what we do is go 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.250
 sticking with the glue stick on the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.959
 first part will be the middle one is 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.510
 say let's paste these two strips of 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.450
 here we take the glue any 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.960
 bar glue serves you and we extend 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.930
 along 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.290
 of the accordion that we already have made with 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.290
 paper 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.670
 Once the glue is put on 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.910
 the paper presses you press them hard 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.690
 in such a way 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.420
 we will stay 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.959
 as if it were a fan yes 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.970
 we do this same with everyone in this 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.190
 case we have caught four you can do 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.780
 always four five or six depending 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.330
 the papers you what ye 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.150
 we do with all the papers if here 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.489
 I have the red and we have the white here 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.400
 also stuck in the middle also 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.200
 we have the green stuck in the middle and 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.120
 we have yellow stuck in the middle 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.150
 Once we hit the four 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.690
 papers what we do is to give the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.209
 glue for each side of the four 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.669
 what we have is to say on this side 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.160
 this side and so on by all 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.700
 the sides so that we can 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.550
 hit them and stick together we stick 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.740
 on this side we take the target by 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.449
 example we paste on the east side 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.259
 and once we have the two sides 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.910
 stuck together we advise you always 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.509
 that you start at the center so 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.199
 always look good at the same level and 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.199
 press them 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.160
 the same thing we're going to do on this other side 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.390
 from here 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.790
 we apply the glue 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.070
 and with green for example in one of the 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.560
 lateral we apply the glue of the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.370
 same way and the procedure is the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.240
 same with all the papers that we have 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.980
 depending on how you want it to be 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 your garland if you want it to be more 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.050
 big or smaller because you can add 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.600
 I already tell you 5 or 6 papers that 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.920
 you want to continue applying 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.920
 glue on this side 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.300
 the side of the yellow paper 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.680
 we unite from the center and press 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:36.180
 press well always 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.979
 so that the more you paste is less 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.210
 odds that our garland 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.479
 is going to break 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.610
 once we have most of the 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.389
 glued sides the only thing that we would miss 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.229
 would join these two extremes here 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.720
 Well, we do the same 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.720
 bar procedure on one side 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.600
 bar on the other 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:07.529
 and we always stick with care so that 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:09.709
 coincide the ends is a little bit for 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:09.709
 here 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.339
 and we would have our garland 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.740
 the last thing we would have to do 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.840
 would be drilling 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.060
 one of the ends where we want 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.229
 the color that we want for 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.229
 example from this side of here 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.100
 we make a small drill to be able 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.100
 insert then 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.069
 the corresponding cord to be able 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.069
 hang it and ready 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.039
 and we would have our life to hang 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.600
 simple not good so up here this 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.550
 video tutorial on how to make a 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.550
 garland to hang on the roof
