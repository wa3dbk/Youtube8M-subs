we<00:02:51.739> were<00:02:51.919> thinking<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.700> would<00:02:52.940> allow<00:02:53.480> a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
we were thinking that it would allow a

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.379 
we were thinking that it would allow a
nice<00:02:55.579> gamut<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.329> tones<00:02:56.599> for<00:02:57.139> that<00:02:57.560> type<00:02:57.859> of<00:02:58.389> ant

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
nice gamut of tones for that type of ant

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.440 
nice gamut of tones for that type of ant
family<00:02:59.959> for<00:03:00.380> recording<00:03:00.859> purposes<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:02.000> yeah

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
family for recording purposes but yeah

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.589 
family for recording purposes but yeah
but<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.900> was<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.609> great<00:03:04.819> gigging<00:03:05.209> amp<00:03:05.419> -

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
but it was it's a great gigging amp -

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.400 
but it was it's a great gigging amp -
absolutely

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
absolutely

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.789 
absolutely
but<00:03:06.560> totally<00:03:06.919> right<00:03:07.040> there<00:03:07.310> was<00:03:08.440> mass<00:03:09.440> killer

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
but totally right there was mass killer

but totally right there was mass killer
you<00:03:10.340> know<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.819> have<00:03:10.970> switches<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:11.810> allow

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
you know we have switches that allow

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
you know we have switches that allow
some<00:03:12.470> tweaks<00:03:12.799> on<00:03:13.099> it<00:03:14.349> that<00:03:16.000> different<00:03:17.000> kind<00:03:17.209> of
