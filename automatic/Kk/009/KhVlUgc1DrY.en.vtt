00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
nice obviously have work on the chassis

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
nice obviously have work on the chassis

but it all seems to be in in really
really<00:02:09.330> good<00:02:09.539> shape<00:02:09.720> actually<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.450> don't

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
really good shape actually so we don't

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.740 
really good shape actually so we don't
have<00:02:12.810> any<00:02:12.989> real<00:02:13.410> history

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
good job looking down the near side

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.000 
good job looking down the near side

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the bulk anything any patch up and find

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.360 
the bulk anything any patch up and find
it's<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.360> inside<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.980> middle<00:02:39.220> there

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
it's just inside in the middle there

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.490 
it's just inside in the middle there
despite<00:02:39.730> Emily<00:02:40.240> think<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.870> screen<00:02:41.140> Center

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
despite Emily think the screen Center

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.130 
despite Emily think the screen Center
join<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.670> suspect<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.450> original

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
join so I suspect it is the original

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.290 
join so I suspect it is the original
bulkhead<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:45.490> all<00:02:45.580> looks<00:02:45.610> very<00:02:45.790> good<00:02:46.090> down

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
bulkhead that all looks very good down

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.630 
bulkhead that all looks very good down
there<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:47.560> couple<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:48.070> very<00:02:48.340> slight

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
there a couple of very slight

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.160 
there a couple of very slight
indentations<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> doors<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.050> they're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
indentations in the doors but they're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.210 
indentations in the doors but they're
very<00:02:50.200> old<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.330> they<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> original<00:02:52.750> doors

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
very old so they all the original doors

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.790 
very old so they all the original doors
it's<00:02:54.220> got<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.459> correct<00:02:54.670> perspex<00:02:55.800> side

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
it's got the correct perspex side

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.600 
it's got the correct perspex side
windows<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.250> everything<00:02:59.100> doors<00:03:00.100> all<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.430> great

there's<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.510> slight<00:03:19.750> patch<00:03:20.049> just<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> top

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
there's a slight patch just in the top

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.210 
there's a slight patch just in the top
of<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:23.230> below<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> vent<00:03:23.799> panel<00:03:23.980> just

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
of the just below the vent panel just

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.979 
of the just below the vent panel just
there<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.720> all<00:03:25.870> looks<00:03:26.080> nice<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
there but that all looks nice the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.840 
there but that all looks nice the
bulkhead<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.140> here<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.980> toe<00:03:30.549> board

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
bulkhead in here and the toe board

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.880 
bulkhead in here and the toe board
possibly<00:03:31.450> been<00:03:32.019> patched<00:03:32.260> there<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.830> all

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
possibly been patched there but it all

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.500 
possibly been patched there but it all
looks<00:03:32.950> nice<00:03:33.310> around<00:03:33.580> here<00:03:33.760> that's<00:03:34.150> all<00:03:34.330> good

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
looks nice around here that's all good

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.930 
looks nice around here that's all good
football<00:03:37.510> nice<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.170> those<00:03:38.320> mats<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:39.760> got<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
football nice and those mats it's got a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.310 
football nice and those mats it's got a
Smith's<00:03:40.239> heater<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:40.780> not<00:03:40.900> connected

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
Smith's heater but it's not connected

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.830 
Smith's heater but it's not connected
actually<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:41.709> look<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.980> that's<00:03:42.220> not<00:03:45.840> dash

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
actually one look of it that's not dash

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.900 
actually one look of it that's not dash
is<00:03:47.049> put<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.350> much<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.680> cut<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.340> think<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.820> only

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
is put so much on cut I think the only

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.229 
is put so much on cut I think the only
thing<00:03:49.000> you've<00:03:49.239> got<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.890> an<00:03:50.890> extra<00:03:51.400> dial<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
thing you've got is an extra dial on the

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.789 
thing you've got is an extra dial on the
other<00:03:52.510> side<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.810> steering<00:03:53.019> column<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.590> was

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
other side of the steering column I was

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.740 
other side of the steering column I was
working<00:03:54.220> temperature<00:03:54.549> gauge<00:03:54.730> but<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:55.600> still

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
working temperature gauge but it's still

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.509 
working temperature gauge but it's still
got<00:03:55.930> things<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.530> headlamp<00:03:57.130> dip<00:03:57.310> switch

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
got things like the headlamp dip switch
