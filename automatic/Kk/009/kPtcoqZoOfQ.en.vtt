 I hope all your goals are met 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.019
 all their purposes are fulfilled and not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 only this year of all the years that 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.629
 they continue also and in this year in special 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 2015 let me tell you that we 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.300
 planned some things that things like 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.300
 is it so 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.579
 in talent 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.890
 magnificent provoked magnificent 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 spectacular 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.220
 special seriously do not have any idea anymore 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.080
 we have many ideas there already for this 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.090
 year but today to start the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.170
 I'm going to teach you how to make a thread 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.000
 well rich chocolate with sneaker well 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.890
 rich actually has a meaning because 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 I wanted to do it in thread because here in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.940
 mexico I do not know if in other countries 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 also celebrate it but here in mexico 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.619
 we celebrate the day of kings is what we 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.660
 celebrate then when the wise men 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.729
 they went to visit the imitated jesus and they give him 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.560
 gifts I do not know how but here in Mexico 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.600
 we celebrate that someone comes to you 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.430
 little house there is a thread of kings and what 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.960
 share like this with your family is very 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.670
 different from the one I'm going to teach 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.800
 do today because I already know that a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.970
 I like to get out of the normal and what 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.820
 traditional because I'm special but the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.670
 joke of these threads is that inside of 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.830
 the mass must have some monkeys that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.649
 when you 're splitting it like this between 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.780
 people can be the salty good as well 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.550
 we say here in Culiacán I do not know if in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.620
 another side that with very bad luck you 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.590
 play that monkey why 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.180
 on February 2 a few days later this 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 person that the monkey touched 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.830
 bring tamales to another convivial 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.300
 that they do then and then they have to 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.610
 that is more than kings the joke is 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.270
 to put the monkeys and that the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.270
 enjoy in family 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.270
 two cups of wheat flour two bars 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.820
 of unsalted butter at temperature 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.190
 two sugar cups four 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.980
 eggs a teaspoon of powder for 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.650
 bake a pinch of salt a cup of 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.410
 whole milk one tablespoon of extract

 and three sneakers in pieces 250 grams 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.530
 of chocolate cut into pieces very 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.350
 small or who sell it and in 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.870
 sprinkle half a cup of whole milk and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.670
 a sneaker in pieces 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.220
 and also a any tea of ​​monitos 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.280
 for kings threads forgiveness if you see a 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 little fake is that when I did it 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.120
 do not forget them 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.680
 you need a mold to screw the one I 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.400
 I'm going to use measures as 25cm 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.590
 diameter 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.620
 first preheat your oven about 15 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.900
 minutes before at 180 degrees centigrade or 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.900
 if your oven is of numbers between 1 and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.780
 2 cream butter 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.780
 add the sugar and the pinch of salt 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.260
 add the eggs 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.260
 one by one 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.569
 the vanilla and beat at medium speed 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.569
 1 minute 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.960
 add the flour through a colander 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.810
 and also add the milk little by little 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.360
 passes through a colander the cocoa and the powder 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.570
 to bake and mix everything for a minute 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.570
 plus 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.629
 finally add the sneakers in 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.180
 little pieces and also the little ones that 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.920
 now they are imaginary and mixed with 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.380
 a spoon or some palette all 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.770
 now you're going to grease with butter or 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.930
 Butter all your super thread mold 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.350
 well and you're going to put a little flour 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.350
 as well 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.840
 adding all the chocolate mixture and 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.370
 remember that you should never fill it 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.170
 completely to the limit always 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.810
 you must leave the space to be 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.750
 export because if you do not risk that 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.870
 Go out raw and bake 180 degrees 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.660
 centigrade for 40 to 50 minutes the 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.330
 time depends a lot on the power of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.460
 your oven and the depth of the mold 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.410
 of thread that you have used will be 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.930
 list until you see it is a little 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.320
 golden brown from above and that you set a 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.810
 fork and leave clean and as soon as 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.970
 Take out a little stick for all the 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.160
 banks and in the center too and now 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.320
 if you leave the one that is removed a little bit 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.530
 cold when it is removed a little bit 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.900
 cold flips the go a few taps for 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.060
 take it out as surely as it is going to happen 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.760
 is that they stay stuck little 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.080
 mix sneaker up but just remove the 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.080
 and arrange the in the thread 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.530
 heat the milk like this in the fire or in 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.980
 the microwave until you see it start 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.870
 To boil 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.850
 this is where you are going to add all the 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.720
 chocolate and you will mix it until 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:54.270
 melts completely since your thread 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.850
 it's cold you 're going to drop it 's like 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:04.320
 type chocolate sauce on all the 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:06.600
 Thread there are that rich I've seen and for 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.230
 last decorate it with the sneaker in 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.230
 chunks 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.360

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.120
 Perez 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.650
 and it would be very special that instead of 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.660

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.030
