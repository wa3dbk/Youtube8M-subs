00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
dreadlocks for in 77 months I've been

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.430 
dreadlocks for in 77 months I've been
doing<00:00:12.150> some<00:00:12.210> slightly<00:00:12.809> different<00:00:13.290> things

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
doing some slightly different things

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.860 
doing some slightly different things
this<00:00:13.559> week<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.940> kind<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.480> not<00:00:15.690> been

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this week I have kind of not been

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.960 
this week I have kind of not been
splitting<00:00:16.470> any<00:00:16.920> dreads<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.550> months<00:00:17.850> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
splitting any dreads for months and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150 
splitting any dreads for months and
months<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.240> month<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.230> then<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.500> did<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.890> video

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
months a month and then I did the video

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.590 
months a month and then I did the video
I<00:00:20.220> split<00:00:20.640> some<00:00:20.789> dreads<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> only

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
I split some dreads and that's the only

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
I split some dreads and that's the only
time<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.529> thought<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
time that I really thought about it and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.939 
time that I really thought about it and
the<00:00:24.150> other<00:00:24.210> day<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:25.140> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.769> going

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the other day I was kind of going

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890 
the other day I was kind of going
through<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.430> realized<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.000> probably<00:00:27.510> need<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
through and realized I probably need to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
through and realized I probably need to
separate<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> few<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.949> then<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.340> turned<00:00:29.580> into<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
separate a few and then I turned into I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
separate a few and then I turned into I
probably<00:00:30.359> need<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.570> separate<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.859> I've

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
probably need to separate a lot so I've

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.990 
probably need to separate a lot so I've
been<00:00:31.980> doing<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.219> lot<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.369> separating<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
been doing a lot of separating this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880 
been doing a lot of separating this
month<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.809> probably<00:00:34.200> won't<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.469> able<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> tell

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
month you probably won't be able to tell

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
month you probably won't be able to tell
because<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.030> stuff<00:00:36.329> at<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because you know it's just stuff at the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
because you know it's just stuff at the
root<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.710> gone<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.430> bit<00:00:38.610> too

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
root but some have gone a little bit too

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
root but some have gone a little bit too
far<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.180> split<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.660> someone<00:00:40.110> had<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> work<00:00:40.500> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
far to split and someone had to work on

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
far to split and someone had to work on
for<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.280> few<00:00:41.550> days<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.120> down<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
for a few days to get down because I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
for a few days to get down because I
realized<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.829> maybe<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> end<00:00:45.030> up

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
realized that maybe I'm going to end up

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
realized that maybe I'm going to end up
with<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> threads<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.829> bit

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
with kind of threads are a little bit

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
with kind of threads are a little bit
too<00:00:47.160> thick<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> wanted<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.960> go

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
too thick for what I wanted so if i go

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.680 
too thick for what I wanted so if i go
around<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:51.000> are<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> stay<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
around now these are going to stay so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.080 
around now these are going to stay so
together<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> separate<00:00:53.879> off

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
together this one I want to separate off

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150 
together this one I want to separate off
because<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> thin<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.920> it's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
because it's a thin one and I think it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
because it's a thin one and I think it's
nice<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.579> actually<00:00:56.670> still<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.570> thin<00:00:57.960> one

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
nice to actually still have one thin one

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
nice to actually still have one thin one
left<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.489> been<00:00:59.760> pulling<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.239> away

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
left but I've been pulling that away

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
left but I've been pulling that away
from<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> still

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
from there but this is kind of still

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.399 
from there but this is kind of still
hump<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> want<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
hump which I don't know what I want a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
hump which I don't know what I want a
lump<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.769> front<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.070> my<00:01:05.159> face<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> but

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
lump in front of my face like that but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
lump in front of my face like that but
it<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.150> quite<00:01:06.600> nice<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.470> only

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it is quite nice that I can just only

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
it is quite nice that I can just only
have<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> move<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.090> lump<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> pulls

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
have to move this one lump and it pulls

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
have to move this one lump and it pulls
them<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.560> face<00:01:10.740> rather<00:01:11.010> than<00:01:11.220> one

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
them all out of my face rather than one

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
them all out of my face rather than one
form<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> four<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.299> three<00:01:12.479> four<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> rest

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
form to four and three four but the rest

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
form to four and three four but the rest
pretty<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:14.280> everything<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.000> I've

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
pretty much everything you can see I've

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
pretty much everything you can see I've
kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.780> separated<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:16.770> I'm

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
kind of separated off now because I'm

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
kind of separated off now because I'm
kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> happy<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.509> dreads<00:01:19.320> are

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
kind of happy with how the dreads are

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
kind of happy with how the dreads are
only<00:01:19.979> downside<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> separating<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
only downside to all the separating is I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.330 
only downside to all the separating is I
mean<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> fluffiness

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
mean I get a little bit of fluffiness

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
mean I get a little bit of fluffiness
around<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> roots<00:01:24.150> where<00:01:24.600> some<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> ones

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
around the roots where some of the ones

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
around the roots where some of the ones
that<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.650> been<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:26.310> stuck<00:01:26.580> together

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that have been really stuck together

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
that have been really stuck together
I've<00:01:27.540> had<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.960> separated<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> some<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> my

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I've had to be separated and some of my

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.499 
I've had to be separated and some of my
baby<00:01:30.119> dreads<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:31.079> these<00:01:31.560> ones<00:01:32.240> if<00:01:33.240> they've

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
baby dreads like these ones if they've

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
baby dreads like these ones if they've
been<00:01:33.720> caught<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.950> splitting<00:01:35.369> I'm

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
been caught up in that splitting I'm

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060 
been caught up in that splitting I'm
have<00:01:36.420> started<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> get<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.170> thin<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
have started to get really thin of the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
have started to get really thin of the
roots<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.090> where<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.689> specific

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
roots I don't know where my specific

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.770 
roots I don't know where my specific
example<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.250> there's<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.390> here

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
example was but there's one around here

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.010 
example was but there's one around here
I<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.899> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I think it's this one and that's kind of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
I think it's this one and that's kind of
thin<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.409> root<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.040> wouldn't<00:01:47.820> be

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
thin at the root and I wouldn't be

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.179 
thin at the root and I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.470> pulled<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.040> day

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
surprised if I got pulled out one day

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.700 
surprised if I got pulled out one day

video<00:02:07.049> which<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.710> cool<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.220> then

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
video which would be cool and then

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
video which would be cool and then
you'll<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.030> able<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.360> sort<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.690> side<00:02:10.050> by<00:02:10.349> side<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you'll be able to sort of side by side a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.979 
you'll be able to sort of side by side a
complete<00:02:11.430> years<00:02:11.910> worth<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.360> dreadlock<00:02:12.750> growth

complete years worth of dreadlock growth

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.530 
complete years worth of dreadlock growth
I<00:02:13.200> guess

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I guess

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.699 
I guess
because<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.840> haven't<00:02:14.019> trimmed<00:02:14.290> them<00:02:14.439> in<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
because I haven't trimmed them in the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.050 
because I haven't trimmed them in the
last<00:02:14.890> year<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.219> then<00:02:15.459> I'll<00:02:15.579> be<00:02:15.700> able<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.909> look

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
last year and then I'll be able to look

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.580 
last year and then I'll be able to look
and<00:02:16.360> show<00:02:16.689> you<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.079> then<00:02:17.110> you'll<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:17.349> able<00:02:17.439> to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and show you and then you'll be able to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.220 
and show you and then you'll be able to
see<00:02:17.799> um<00:02:18.069> how<00:02:18.969> much<00:02:19.150> my<00:02:19.569> dreadlocks<00:02:19.780> have<00:02:20.049> grown

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.080 
see um how much my dreadlocks have grown
in<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.409> year<00:02:20.650> because<00:02:21.159> they<00:02:21.310> grow<00:02:21.609> slower<00:02:21.909> than

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
in a year because they grow slower than

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
in a year because they grow slower than
normal<00:02:22.239> hair<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.780> some<00:02:23.079> people<00:02:23.290> often<00:02:23.500> ask

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
normal hair and some people often ask

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.099 
normal hair and some people often ask
how<00:02:24.010> fast<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> drug<00:02:24.519> looks<00:02:24.730> grow<00:02:24.939> and<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.959> an

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
how fast a drug looks grow and it's an

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.569 
how fast a drug looks grow and it's an
interesting<00:02:26.319> question<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.069> don't<00:02:27.340> sit

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
interesting question but I don't sit

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.220 
interesting question but I don't sit
here<00:02:27.760> with<00:02:27.909> a<00:02:27.969> measuring<00:02:28.299> tape<00:02:28.480> or<00:02:28.870> anything

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
here with a measuring tape or anything

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.890 
here with a measuring tape or anything
so<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.829> do<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.430> off<00:02:30.609> looks<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:31.030> feel<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.659> I'm

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so just do it off looks I feel like I'm

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.140 
so just do it off looks I feel like I'm
about<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.439> go<00:02:32.590> into<00:02:32.769> another<00:02:33.040> messy<00:02:33.400> stage<00:02:33.790> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
about to go into another messy stage I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.849 
about to go into another messy stage I
sometimes<00:02:34.420> talk<00:02:34.689> about<00:02:34.900> how<00:02:35.109> dreadlock<00:02:35.620> loose

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
sometimes talk about how dreadlock loose

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.789 
sometimes talk about how dreadlock loose
hairs<00:02:36.220> goes<00:02:36.549> through<00:02:36.730> cycles<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:38.470> you

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
hairs goes through cycles and so if you

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.250 
hairs goes through cycles and so if you
watch<00:02:39.250> through<00:02:39.790> my<00:02:39.909> videos<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.450> might<00:02:40.599> see<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.559 
watch through my videos you might see a
few<00:02:41.590> months<00:02:41.920> where<00:02:42.159> I<00:02:42.189> have<00:02:42.730> quite<00:02:43.060> neat

little patch here comes and goes a bit

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.099 
little patch here comes and goes a bit
in<00:02:51.489> front<00:02:51.579> of<00:02:51.730> my<00:02:51.819> face<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.599> actual<00:02:52.870> cycle

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
in front of my face but the actual cycle

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.449 
in front of my face but the actual cycle
is<00:02:53.470> something<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.799> I've<00:02:53.889> mentioned<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.430> I

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
is something that I've mentioned and I

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.069 
is something that I've mentioned and I
haven't<00:02:54.730> created<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.150> full<00:02:55.299> video<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.870> yet

but<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.470> basically<00:02:56.889> this<00:02:57.129> idea<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.579> i<00:02:57.790> have

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
but it's basically this idea that i have

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.819 
but it's basically this idea that i have
that<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.689> get<00:02:58.870> loose<00:02:59.079> hair<00:02:59.319> and<00:02:59.470> loose<00:02:59.620> hair

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
that you get loose hair and loose hair

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.140 
that you get loose hair and loose hair
and<00:02:59.950> loose<00:03:00.069> hair<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.459> certain<00:03:00.730> point<00:03:00.909> and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
and loose hair to a certain point and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.429 
and loose hair to a certain point and
that<00:03:01.239> once<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:01.780> long<00:03:01.930> enough<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.319> have

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
that once it's long enough and you have

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.929 
that once it's long enough and you have
enough<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.129> all<00:03:03.280> turns<00:03:03.489> into<00:03:03.669> little

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
enough of it it all turns into little

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.699 
enough of it it all turns into little
baby<00:03:04.060> dreads<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.629> it's<00:03:05.139> no<00:03:05.290> longer<00:03:05.439> lose

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
baby dreads and then it's no longer lose

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.949 
baby dreads and then it's no longer lose
hair<00:03:05.889> and<00:03:06.069> then<00:03:06.489> slowly<00:03:06.909> over<00:03:07.389> a<00:03:07.569> period<00:03:07.659> of

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
hair and then slowly over a period of

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.300 
hair and then slowly over a period of
time<00:03:08.169> that<00:03:08.200> loose<00:03:08.650> here<00:03:08.829> comes<00:03:09.040> back<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
time that loose here comes back and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.379 
time that loose here comes back and
comes<00:03:09.489> back<00:03:09.669> and<00:03:09.760> come<00:03:09.909> back<00:03:10.120> when<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.359> have

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
comes back and come back when you have

comes back and come back when you have
to<00:03:10.540> wait<00:03:10.689> for<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.019> turn<00:03:11.169> his<00:03:11.349> new<00:03:11.500> loose
