00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
back as well for games that use those

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
back as well for games that use those
because<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:40.670> thing<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.850> Bluetooth<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.450> can

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
because this thing is Bluetooth we can

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.540 
because this thing is Bluetooth we can
also<00:01:41.690> run<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.200> from<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> notre<00:01:43.070> distance

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
also run it from the notre distance

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.740 
also run it from the notre distance
we've<00:01:43.640> got<00:01:43.729> it<00:01:43.820> hooks<00:01:43.970> up<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.120> TV<00:01:44.540> there

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
we've got it hooks up the TV there

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.080 
we've got it hooks up the TV there
understand<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.190> we<00:01:46.400> can<00:01:46.580> charge<00:01:46.910> around

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
understand so we can charge around

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.490 
understand so we can charge around
penkridge<00:01:47.510> suppose<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:48.460> sounds<00:01:49.460> like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.290 

so<00:01:53.620> as<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.130> see<00:01:54.310> house<00:01:54.550> in<00:01:54.700> federal<00:01:55.000> prison

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
so as you see house in federal prison

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.220 
so as you see house in federal prison
closure<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.830> really<00:01:57.280> easy<00:01:57.550> to
