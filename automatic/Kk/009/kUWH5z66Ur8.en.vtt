we<00:00:38.750> have<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.020> la<00:00:39.410> croix<00:00:39.680> Katzie<00:00:40.520> analyzer<00:00:41.090> that

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
we have a la croix Katzie analyzer that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.170 
we have a la croix Katzie analyzer that
shows<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.870> SuperSpeed<00:00:42.320> USB<00:00:42.380> traffic<00:00:43.130> and<00:00:43.340> we

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
shows the SuperSpeed USB traffic and we

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.780 
shows the SuperSpeed USB traffic and we
have<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.540> source<00:00:44.840> of<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.200> video<00:00:45.500> our<00:00:45.829> USB<00:00:46.220> 3.0

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
have the source of the video our USB 3.0

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.630 
have the source of the video our USB 3.0
ler<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.500> what<00:00:48.649> we've<00:00:48.800> actually<00:00:48.950> done<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.489> we've

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
ler so what we've actually done is we've

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.340 
ler so what we've actually done is we've
taken<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.000> device<00:00:50.210> controller<00:00:50.600> implemented

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
taken the device controller implemented

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.920 
taken the device controller implemented
in<00:00:51.440> an<00:00:51.559> FPGA<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:53.000> put<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:53.270> into<00:00:53.329> this<00:00:53.660> system

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
in an FPGA and put that into this system

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.590 
in an FPGA and put that into this system
system<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.829> our<00:00:55.070> video<00:00:55.370> source<00:00:55.700> we<00:00:56.360> take<00:00:56.570> a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
system is our video source we take a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.280 
system is our video source we take a
high-definition<00:00:57.550> video<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.260> decompress<00:01:00.260> it

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
high-definition video and decompress it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.650 
high-definition video and decompress it
put<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.190> through<00:01:01.399> our<00:01:01.430> USB<00:01:01.760> 3.0<00:01:02.270> trailer

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
put it in through our USB 3.0 trailer

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.040 
put it in through our USB 3.0 trailer
which<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.559> FPGA<00:01:04.449> encoded<00:01:05.449> in<00:01:05.540> USB<00:01:05.750> 3

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
high-definition display here so we

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.020
