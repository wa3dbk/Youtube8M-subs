receive the gold flakes are 14 karats
it's<00:00:55.500> supposed<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.070> 24<00:00:56.670> karat<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:58.370> test

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it's supposed to be 24 karat but a test

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.349 
it's supposed to be 24 karat but a test
will<00:00:59.640> prove<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
will prove it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
will prove it
whether<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.930> 14k<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.719> 24k<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.049> less<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> you

rub it on the stone it's kind of a rough

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.640 
rub it on the stone it's kind of a rough
slate<00:01:13.920> stone<00:01:14.780> until<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> leave

slate stone until you leave
Gold's<00:01:17.189> scratch<00:01:17.670> marks<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.259> add<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
Gold's scratch marks then you add the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.420 
Gold's scratch marks then you add the
gold<00:01:20.100> acid<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.150> top<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:22.979> long<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.400> takes

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
gold acid on top see how long it takes

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.630 
gold acid on top see how long it takes
to<00:01:23.790> eat<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> sample<00:01:24.689> away<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> 14

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to eat the sample away this is a 14

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.170 
to eat the sample away this is a 14
karat<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.439> 14<00:01:28.920> karat<00:01:29.280> gold<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.790> hardly

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
karat so the 14 karat gold is hardly

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.990 
karat so the 14 karat gold is hardly

the oil is covered by using my plastic
pen<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.440> see<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> acid<00:02:14.400> working<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:15.000> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
pen you can see the acid working at it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
pen you can see the acid working at it
eating<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.810> up

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
eating it up

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.720 
eating it up
but<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:17.880> not<00:02:18.140> disappearing<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:20.100> quick<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
but it's not disappearing as quick as a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.300 
but it's not disappearing as quick as a
14<00:02:21.420> K<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.080> must<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.410> some<00:02:22.650> sort<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.100> gold

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
14 K so there must be some sort of gold

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
14 K so there must be some sort of gold
in<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:24.290> amazing<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.850> should<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.600> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
in here amazing so it should you know it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
in here amazing so it should you know it
should<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.290> eaten<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:29.070> by<00:02:29.250> now<00:02:29.430> but

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
should be eaten all up by now but

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.140 
should be eaten all up by now but
there's<00:02:29.850> some<00:02:30.120> traces<00:02:30.780> or<00:02:31.050> maybe<00:02:31.940> 10%<00:02:32.940> maybe

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
there's some traces or maybe 10% maybe

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
there's some traces or maybe 10% maybe
5%<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:34.230> sticking<00:02:34.680> around<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> let's<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.230> let's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
5% is sticking around so let's so let's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.540 
5% is sticking around so let's so let's
use<00:02:38.070> our<00:02:38.280> 10<00:02:39.060> karat<00:02:39.540> sample<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:40.740> fast

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
use our 10 karat sample and see how fast

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.840 
use our 10 karat sample and see how fast
the<00:02:42.450> gold<00:02:42.750> deteriorates<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.460> acid

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the gold deteriorates in the acid

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.440 
the gold deteriorates in the acid
compared<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> 10<00:02:45.810> karat<00:02:46.080> scratch<00:02:46.770> marks

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
compared to the 10 karat scratch marks

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.480 
compared to the 10 karat scratch marks
so<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.570> move<00:02:49.140> some<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.650> acid<00:02:50.040> over<00:02:50.280> there

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
so I move some of the acid over there

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.870 
so I move some of the acid over there
and<00:02:51.380> we<00:02:52.380> still<00:02:52.650> got<00:02:52.770> some<00:02:52.950> gold<00:02:53.280> flakes<00:02:53.640> in

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
and we still got some gold flakes in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
and we still got some gold flakes in
there<00:02:54.030> there's<00:02:54.989> text<00:02:55.380> sticking<00:02:55.709> around<00:02:55.830> let's

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
there there's text sticking around let's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.479 
there there's text sticking around let's
put<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.670> new<00:02:56.910> flake<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.680> we'll<00:02:58.680> test<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.280> one

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
put a new flake in we'll test that one

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.600 
put a new flake in we'll test that one
so<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.300> can<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:01.080> acid<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.650> still<00:03:01.920> 8<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so you can see the acid is still 8 and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.640 
so you can see the acid is still 8 and
eating<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.300> stuff<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.020> not<00:03:04.230> going

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
eating this stuff but is not going

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.430 
eating this stuff but is not going
really<00:03:04.890> fast<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.540> there's<00:03:06.900> something<00:03:07.350> in

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
really fast so there's something in

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.370 
really fast so there's something in
there<00:03:07.620> maybe<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.040> five<00:03:08.340> karat<00:03:08.910> gold<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
there maybe it's five karat gold and the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.560 
there maybe it's five karat gold and the
little<00:03:10.650> traces<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.459> be<00:03:11.580> left<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:12.060> just

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
little traces that will be left in just

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.260 
little traces that will be left in just
a<00:03:12.660> few<00:03:12.870> seconds<00:03:13.380> here<00:03:13.560> there'll<00:03:14.250> be<00:03:14.340> 10<00:03:14.820> karat

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
a few seconds here there'll be 10 karat

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.680 
a few seconds here there'll be 10 karat
gold

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
gold

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
gold
well<00:03:15.870> 10<00:03:16.230> karat<00:03:16.590> gold<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.040> less<00:03:17.280> than<00:03:17.489> half

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
well 10 karat gold is less than half

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.190 
well 10 karat gold is less than half
gold<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.080> still<00:03:19.290> something<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:21.200> looks

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
gold but it's still something so looks

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.949 
gold but it's still something so looks
to<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:22.590> these<00:03:23.459> gold<00:03:23.790> flakes<00:03:24.180> do<00:03:24.480> contain

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
to me like these gold flakes do contain

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.759 
to me like these gold flakes do contain
maybe<00:03:25.380> 10<00:03:26.900> 10<00:03:27.900> %<00:03:28.380> 5<00:03:29.010> carat<00:03:29.880> gold<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.540> maybe<00:03:30.780> 5%

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
maybe 10 10 % 5 carat gold and maybe 5%

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.160 
maybe 10 10 % 5 carat gold and maybe 5%
of<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.130> 10<00:03:32.610> karat<00:03:32.880> gold<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.540> there's<00:03:33.810> certain

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
of the 10 karat gold so there's certain

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.610 
of the 10 karat gold so there's certain
percentage<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.550> actual<00:03:36.540> gold<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.590> have

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
percentage of it is actual gold you have

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.670 
percentage of it is actual gold you have
a<00:03:37.769> vial<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.519> has<00:03:39.150> real<00:03:39.510> gold<00:03:39.810> am<00:03:40.019> not<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.320> lot

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
a vial that has real gold am not a lot

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.090 
a vial that has real gold am not a lot
because<00:03:41.220> he's<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> really<00:03:41.730> lightweight<00:03:42.120> flakes

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
because he's a really lightweight flakes

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.290 
because he's a really lightweight flakes
but<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.459> real<00:03:44.910> gold<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:47.760> worth<00:03:48.120> a

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
but it is real gold and so it's worth a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.320 
but it is real gold and so it's worth a
few<00:03:48.540> bucks<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.489> because<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.820> nature<00:03:51.120> of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
few bucks and because of the nature of

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.140 
few bucks and because of the nature of
gold<00:03:51.950> we

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
gold we

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.830 
gold we
was<00:03:53.269> not<00:03:53.480> 18<00:03:54.470> karat<00:03:54.920> or<00:03:55.010> 14<00:03:55.069> karat<00:03:55.579> was<00:03:56.239> some<00:03:56.689> of

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
was not 18 karat or 14 karat was some of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.979 
was not 18 karat or 14 karat was some of
it<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.079> 10<00:03:57.349> karat<00:03:58.000> because<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.180> how<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.329> prices

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
it is 10 karat because of how the prices

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.470 
it is 10 karat because of how the prices
are<00:04:00.140> going<00:04:00.290> up<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.769> gold<00:04:01.040> lately<00:04:01.549> it's<00:04:02.090> worth

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
are going up in gold lately it's worth

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.809 
are going up in gold lately it's worth
something<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.470> may<00:04:03.650> even<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.980> worth<00:04:04.459> more

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
something and it may even be worth more

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.420 
something and it may even be worth more
than<00:04:05.200> what<00:04:06.200> they're<00:04:06.349> selling<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.829> eBay<00:04:07.189> and

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
than what they're selling on eBay and

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.220 
than what they're selling on eBay and
certainly<00:04:07.849> in<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.150> near<00:04:08.360> future<00:04:08.599> it'll<00:04:09.049> be

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
certainly in the near future it'll be

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.690 
certainly in the near future it'll be
worth<00:04:09.439> more<00:04:09.799> so<00:04:11.290> these<00:04:12.290> gold<00:04:12.859> flakes<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.609> I

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
worth more so these gold flakes and I

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.849 
worth more so these gold flakes and I
you<00:04:14.150> know<00:04:14.209> all<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.599> them<00:04:14.989> are<00:04:15.079> not<00:04:15.230> necessarily

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
you know all of them are not necessarily

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.490 
you know all of them are not necessarily
real<00:04:16.220> gold<00:04:16.549> but<00:04:16.820> these<00:04:17.359> ones<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.229> some

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
real gold but these ones have and some

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.620 
real gold but these ones have and some
ten<00:04:18.799> karat<00:04:19.190> gold<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.810> probably<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.870> five<00:04:21.229> carat
