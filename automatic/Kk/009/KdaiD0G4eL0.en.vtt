00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
update in the meantime I have also built

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.740 
update in the meantime I have also built
another<00:01:09.620> container<00:01:10.010> with<00:01:10.580> water<00:01:10.610> I'm<00:01:11.390> keeping

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
another container with water I'm keeping

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.160 
another container with water I'm keeping
on<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.870> back<00:01:12.080> burner<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:13.550> way<00:01:14.330> when<00:01:14.810> I<00:01:14.840> need<00:01:15.050> to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
on a back burner that way when I need to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.910 
on a back burner that way when I need to
add<00:01:15.550> water<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.700> my<00:01:17.060> cans<00:01:17.410> it<00:01:18.410> won't<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:18.710> cold

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
add water to my cans it won't be cold

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.590 
add water to my cans it won't be cold
water<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.580> therefore<00:01:19.729> slow<00:01:20.119> down<00:01:20.300> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
water and therefore slow down the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.740 
water and therefore slow down the
cooking<00:01:20.810> process<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:22.400> that's<00:01:22.729> why<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.600> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
cooking process so that's why I have the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.719 
cooking process so that's why I have the
extra<00:01:24.380> container<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:25.040> water<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.610> back
