like<00:01:08.710> bickering<00:01:09.009> envelopes<00:01:09.789> and<00:01:10.060> then<00:01:10.479> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
like bickering envelopes and then and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.639 
like bickering envelopes and then and
stuff<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.740> allow<00:01:12.429> you<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:13.450> scope<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.409> sound

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
stuff to allow you to to scope the sound

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.859 
stuff to allow you to to scope the sound
just<00:01:15.159> as<00:01:15.429> you<00:01:15.579> wanted<00:01:15.700> all<00:01:16.240> these<00:01:16.420> components

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
just as you wanted all these components

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.679 
just as you wanted all these components
are<00:01:17.259> them<00:01:17.829> balanced<00:01:18.399> with<00:01:18.609> each<00:01:18.729> other<00:01:18.909> to

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
are them balanced with each other to

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.989 
are them balanced with each other to
produce<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:21.159> drum<00:01:21.340> sound<00:01:21.579> more<00:01:21.820> impressive

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
produce the drum sound more impressive

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.529 
produce the drum sound more impressive
sound<00:01:23.249> we<00:01:24.249> think<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.609> is<00:01:24.759> going<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:24.999> be<00:01:25.090> great

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
sound we think this is going to be great

drum<00:01:40.030> sounds<00:01:40.420> for<00:01:40.960> instance<00:01:41.289> add<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.560> little

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
drum sounds for instance add a little

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.099 
drum sounds for instance add a little
bit<00:01:42.069> of<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.310> nice<00:01:42.520> burst<00:01:42.880> if<00:01:43.479> he<00:01:43.630> needs<00:01:43.810> your

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
bit of a nice burst if he needs your

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.419 
bit of a nice burst if he needs your
snare<00:01:44.469> had<00:01:45.460> some<00:01:45.729> meat<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.359> your<00:01:47.189> bass<00:01:48.189> drum

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
snare had some meat to your bass drum

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.669 
snare had some meat to your bass drum
and<00:01:48.639> we<00:01:49.060> got<00:01:49.240> lots<00:01:49.389> of<00:01:49.689> missions<00:01:50.139> can<00:01:50.409> litigate

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
and we got lots of missions can litigate

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.219 
and we got lots of missions can litigate
and<00:01:51.630> we've<00:01:52.630> done<00:01:52.810> done<00:01:53.289> drums<00:01:53.799> before<00:01:54.929> so<00:01:55.929> we

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
and we've done done drums before so we

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.230 
and we've done done drums before so we
know<00:01:56.439> about<00:01:56.859> the<00:01:57.159> important<00:01:57.520> things<00:01:57.759> we<00:01:57.999> know

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
know about the important things we know

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
know about the important things we know
that<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.719> dynamic

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that the dynamic

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.149 
that the dynamic
this<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.240> has<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.870> of<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.590> also<00:02:01.710> know

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this one has a lot of it we also know

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.719 
this one has a lot of it we also know
that<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.850> has<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.650> very<00:02:04.890> fast<00:02:05.220> reaction

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that it has to have a very fast reaction

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.900 
that it has to have a very fast reaction
time<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.650> simply<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:10.850> I'm<00:02:11.850> going

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
time and that is to simply so I'm going

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.690 
time and that is to simply so I'm going
to<00:02:12.090> leave<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:13.080> demos<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.370> other<00:02:14.490> guys

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
to leave the demos to the other guys

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.699 
to leave the demos to the other guys
should<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.180> how<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> play<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.560> can

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
should know how to play and you can

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.940 
should know how to play and you can
watch<00:02:16.890> our<00:02:17.160> demo<00:02:17.489> video<00:02:18.020> little<00:02:19.020> bit<00:02:19.110> in

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
watch our demo video little bit in

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.260 
watch our demo video little bit in
another<00:02:20.250> place<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.090> website<00:02:21.420> thank<00:02:22.140> you
