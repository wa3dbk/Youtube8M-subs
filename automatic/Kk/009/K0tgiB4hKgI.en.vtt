00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.900
Off in a chamber of an old castle deep in a dark wood

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.950
Was a beautiful maiden held captive

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.070
To whomever shall free me from this prison strewn in darkness

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.360
I will give my body.”

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.310
With her fair white skin and scarlet eyes as red as blood

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.400
Many were enchanted, lured to the castle by rumors on the wind

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.380
But countless magical beasts guarded her;

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.510
It is said not a shred of those who went forth ever returned

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.730
“Before I am taken by these evil things

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.130
Please someone save my chastity!”

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.860
But not great Excalibur, nor stubborn Prytwen

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.700
Would even leave a mark

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.390
All those would be saviors were slaughtered, not one left behind

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.290
On the highest floor where the weak princess would wait

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.390
There each man would see

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.600
A mountain of severed heads and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.260
A blood drenched smiling red devil

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.630
With endless victims, this charming engagement

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.660
This neverending banquet would last

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.990
Until the true wish of her ageless body was fulfilled

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.020
What she searched for throughout her long life

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.200
Was a servant who could walk along with her

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.520
As the foolish paupers would age

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.260
Knowing no other way to live

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.760
“Tonight again I take my dinner of massacres

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.100
Dampening this sinful dress

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.300
I feel I might meet my fated one tonight

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.650
After all, see how crimson the moon is…”
