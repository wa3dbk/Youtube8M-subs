00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 you have been the best this in this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.130
 tournament is a small consolation 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.410
 or it is a confirmation of expectations 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 great satisfaction even if yes 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 he preferred to give to win this tournament 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 for all the good team, exactly right 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.199
 and he gave me the attack from rivabella 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.609
 all you are missing holland electra 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.080
 great team then i 'd be 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.349
 we make a goal the first time it was 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 out a different game 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.469
 feel it can be limiting the fact that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.780
 this spring season maybe less 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.300
 dead prepares for much appointment 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.469
 important internationally yes 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
 work is a very prepared team 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.850
 also Thursday only to do the next 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.559
 generation maybe gives them something more 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.320
 at the level of experience however we have 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 made a great game is another thing 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.780
 and all his greater experience is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.899
 state of viareggio 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.579
 the last experience we have there are 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.260
 even more united as a team we have 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.360
 made a big tournament severed up 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.620
 in the end it must be a point of 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.620
 departure to go to win the final 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.110
 no we gave everything then a team 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 must lose 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.190
 It tells us a bit as they lived 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.570
 quoted from the San Siro dock against 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.570
 staff found here to play 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.840
 but surely these experiences in 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.220
 first team have to give me only 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.690
 a personal experience for then 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.180
 bring it back here in the spring that 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.830
 my team and try to give everything for 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.540
 help the team to go to 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.370
 barcelona and then move on 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.170
 certainly if there is such a game 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.880
 the excellent a great possibility of 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:53.960
 to pass 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:56.450
 we had a great game o 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.890
 montolivo is a great player too 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 features quite similar to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.110
 mine, however, we hope to make an are also 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.940
 his own career in short, the idea 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.960
 match was decided in the first half 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.320
 for errors 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.570
 the milan itself was obviously told earlier 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.190
 if we made the goal in the first half 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.050
 probably the game would be suitable 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.270
 in a different way but we succeed in that for 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.580
 do it at home but it's ok so go e 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.170
 those of the Pisans of success nothing 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.060
 they might be a little cooler 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.160
 physically we have gone 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.290
 dropped a little they started doing the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.000
 play them and then try to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.380
 recover the first goal we suffered 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.910
 the g2 to this part of a journey 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.540
 you have given us a way 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.700
 appointment with the first team or with 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.459
 with a particular event 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.769
 no I try I try to give the most 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.170
 possible and arrive as soon as possible 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.610
 possible 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.320
 in the first team as soon as I have 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.459
 the opportunity I will try I will have to give everything 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.459
 to not stop me 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.690
 What did he tell you in these months you 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.180
 look away is certainly already from 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.459
 some from an appointment where what 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.280
 you ask yourself but it gives me advice and tells me 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.870
 that I have to keep improving for per 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.440
 have a chance next year 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.750
 maybe to have some space on 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.600
 defender is just a parenthesis 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.150
 needed and if there is still need to do it 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.560
 but I prefer to play defense 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.340
 with what spirit we leave now for the 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.680
 final eight 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.090
 I think of being a starting point and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.040
 we did a great tournament and must 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.100
 to be a stimulus to go to the final 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.100
 eight
