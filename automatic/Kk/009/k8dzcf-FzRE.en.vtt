00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.580
 now a new comparison of the beautiful view 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.519
 and 7 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.420
 We left the galaxy tab 7.7 in the middle and 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.970
 galaxy note on the right side 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.330
 here will now submit the three to one 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.330
 test 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.760
 to see 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:42.710
 the performance of each and then we will 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.370
 see what the stock will give each 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.629
 of the favorites knowing that the galaxy tab 7 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.519
 for being an older device will have 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.519
 a lower course and outcome 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.220
 galaxy tab 7.7 and the summer galaxy note 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.129
 we are alike since they have 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.520
 similar characteristics're also good 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:15.289
 here the result could galaxy tab 7 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:18.770
 reached 2,834 was 7.7 amounted to 7,252 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:23.350
 points much more than her original 7 already 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.619
 and the galaxy note reaches 6,000 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.619
 836 points 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.539
 the galaxy tab 7.7 made the highest score 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.250
 achieved the highest score 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.110
 however the small difference is something that already 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.380
 was foreseen since both have areas 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.380
 similar 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.160
 now I'm going to run the aquino quadrant 3 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.240
 to see what will be the result that 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.240
 they will reach 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:16.599
 the auditorium dyed good frame rate 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.980
 or she was 7 has not yet started 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.980
 perform the second test step 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:03:00.060
 good here is the result 3609 points and 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:03:03.019
 galaxy note 3353 points again 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.799
 galaxy tab 7 with 7 had a score up 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.799
 of the galaxy note 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:16.140
 while this or she is biscet 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.780
 keep doing test but remember 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.620
 which was a device launched much more of the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.420
 too much and it is only to have a 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.629
 about the increase in visitors that had 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.700
 13 between generations since the 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.519
 evidently that the defendant was 7 will be a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.299
 device but with the weaker agenda that 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.299
 do not be worse 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.930
 here the result of the meeting she was 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.510
 7,223 points 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:56.060
 so it was minus 22 points in the galaxy 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:04:00.510
 tab 7 find 3609 on the galaxy tab 7.7 and 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.489
 3353 points of the galaxy mount and now 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.069
 Let's change the candle test . 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.129
 can see that the galaxy tab 7.7 is in the 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:13.940
 horizontal that sees you the canopy insists 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.940
 just stay in that screen format 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.650
 I'll start the test on the three 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.960
 and we'll see what the outcome will be 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.490
 good here 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.300
 the result of the auction earlier 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.820
 galaxy tab 7 661 points on the test 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:57.330
 html5 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:02.340
 the galaxy tab 7.7 made 1,163 points 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:07.790
 finally the note made 1618 which shows that the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.950
 note and 17.7 are equipment with 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.590
 balanced characteristics since they do not 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:21.960
 see mud or night was better than us 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:36.270
 other tests the seventh best second 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:45.900
 test of the moment 73 points 77 made nine 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:50.250
 points again what the set with 77 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:57.290
 were agitated nearby and the rooster 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.290
 traditional seven was well below 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.990
 yet it never later is still 17 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.250
 a good device still has a good 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.980
 performance 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.290
 of course it does not perform in performance with 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.440
 the most current but he still commands a lot 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.440
 good 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.060
 Good people, now you could have a 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.420
 idea about the performance of the galaxy 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.340
 7.7 even when there are already 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.890
 quad-core processor even more memory 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.260
 ram the 7.7 will not disappoint 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.270
 because on a daily basis practically no 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.880
 difference between dual and quad core 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.060
 and is very good to tablet with super screen 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.890
 very different from other 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.360
 stop watching a boxing video too 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:49.070
 review of this device 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.070
 A hug to everyone and until next time
