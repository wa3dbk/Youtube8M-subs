going back to French polishing and I say

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.759 
going back to French polishing and I say
going<00:00:24.029> back<00:00:24.179> deliberately<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
there are a number of reasons why people

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.869 
there are a number of reasons why people
use<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.699> French<00:00:36.000> polishing<00:00:37.370> one<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.609> one

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
use in French polishing one of them one

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
use in French polishing one of them one
of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> primary<00:00:39.329> reasons<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:40.170> me<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of the primary reasons for me is that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.689 
of the primary reasons for me is that
you're<00:00:41.429> using<00:00:41.820> far<00:00:42.390> less<00:00:42.469> material<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.519> the

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
you're using far less material on on the

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.299 
you're using far less material on on the
instrument<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:46.289> far<00:00:46.500> less<00:00:46.679> material<00:00:47.190> which

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
instrument the far less material which

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.150 
instrument the far less material which
could<00:00:47.489> maybe<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> dampening<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> effect

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
could maybe have a dampening of effect

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.470 
could maybe have a dampening of effect
now<00:00:51.170> punishing<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.410> guitar<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.339> probably<00:00:53.879> won't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now punishing a guitar I probably won't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
now punishing a guitar I probably won't
use<00:00:54.929> one<00:00:55.710> full<00:00:56.160> bottle<00:00:56.519> of<00:00:57.289> French<00:00:58.289> polish<00:00:58.710> how

use one full bottle of French polish how
it<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> used<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.999> spray<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.749> would<00:01:01.589> use<00:01:01.829> at

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it will I used to spray I would use at

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.240 
it will I used to spray I would use at
least<00:01:03.089> three<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:04.230> these<00:01:04.350> three<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> these

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
kinds of water-based lacquer so so you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
kinds of water-based lacquer so so you
could<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.480> the<00:01:09.870> comparison<00:01:10.230> between

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
could you can see the comparison between

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
could you can see the comparison between
how<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.130> material<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
how much material so that's one in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.500 
how much material so that's one in
reasons<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.830> also<00:01:13.950> looks<00:01:14.370> really<00:01:14.670> good

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
reasons it also looks really good

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.150 
reasons it also looks really good
there's<00:01:16.020> something<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
there's something about a way that

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.460 
there's something about a way that
shellac<00:01:17.550> diffracts<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> light<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.110> brings

French polish in my opinion enhances the

French polish in my opinion enhances the
instrument<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.210> many<00:01:45.390> ways<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:47.250> course

instrument in so many ways and of course
there<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.640> secondary<00:01:48.090> reasons<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
there are secondary reasons and the

there are secondary reasons and the
first<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.560> first<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.980> all<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.370> the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
first the first of all I think the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.020 
first the first of all I think the
French<00:01:51.060> polishing<00:01:51.660> is<00:01:52.610> environmentally<00:01:53.610> more

French polishing is environmentally more

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.500 
French polishing is environmentally more

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
pumice powder and where I think people

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.259 
pumice powder and where I think people
make<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:27.170> common<00:03:27.859> mistake<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.849> they<00:03:28.970> try

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
make a common mistake is that they try

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.559 
make a common mistake is that they try
to<00:03:29.299> use<00:03:29.660> lots<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.200> pumice<00:03:30.470> powder<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.489> fill<00:03:31.910> the

to use lots of pumice powder to fill the

to use lots of pumice powder to fill the
grain<00:03:33.109> with<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.889> purely<00:03:34.190> pumice<00:03:34.639> powder<00:03:34.910> and

grain with just purely pumice powder and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.839 
grain with just purely pumice powder and
I<00:03:35.930> think<00:03:36.139> that's<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.530> big<00:03:36.829> mistake<00:03:37.010> because

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
I think that's a big mistake because

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.879 
I think that's a big mistake because
what<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.299> end<00:03:38.480> up<00:03:38.660> with<00:03:39.230> then<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:39.470> white

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
what you end up with then is white

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.220 
what you end up with then is white

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
residue in all of the pores so let me

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.750 
residue in all of the pores so let me
show<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.500> how<00:03:43.069> I<00:03:43.099> think<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:44.180> should<00:03:44.450> do<00:03:44.930> that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
show you how I think you should do that

show you how I think you should do that

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
grain filling process now what I've got

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.550 
grain filling process now what I've got
here<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.680> an<00:03:49.250> old<00:03:49.400> pad<00:03:50.049> with<00:03:51.049> with<00:03:51.349> some

shellac residue on it but by and large
you<00:03:54.139> don't<00:03:54.380> use<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.829> shellac<00:03:55.190> at<00:03:55.400> all<00:03:55.630> I've

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
you don't use the shellac at all I've

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.050 
you don't use the shellac at all I've
just<00:03:57.290> take<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.500> couple<00:03:57.739> drops<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:58.280> methylated

just take a couple drops of methylated

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.650 
just take a couple drops of methylated
spirits<00:03:59.510> and<00:04:00.910> obviously<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.970> syringe<00:04:02.239> is<00:04:02.419> in<00:04:02.510> a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
spirits and obviously a syringe is in a

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.580 
spirits and obviously a syringe is in a
very<00:04:02.870> useful<00:04:03.799> way<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.840> dispensing<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.349> a

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
very useful way of dispensing it so a

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.349 
very useful way of dispensing it so a
little<00:04:06.950> drop<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.130> methylated<00:04:07.700> spirits<00:04:08.120> and

little drop of methylated spirits and

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.500 
little drop of methylated spirits and
then<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.349> tiny<00:04:10.630> dab<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:13.430> pumice<00:04:13.760> powder<00:04:14.030> and

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
then a tiny dab of the pumice powder and

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.370 
then a tiny dab of the pumice powder and
it<00:04:14.959> should<00:04:15.169> dissolve<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.980> become<00:04:16.609> clear<00:04:17.380> then

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
it should dissolve and become clear then

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.380 
it should dissolve and become clear then
once<00:04:18.590> that's<00:04:18.889> on<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.519> pad<00:04:19.989> you're<00:04:20.989> then

once that's on the pad you're then

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.050 
once that's on the pad you're then
rubbing

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
for circular motion now what's happening

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.320 
for circular motion now what's happening
is<00:04:28.139> that<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> pumice<00:04:29.040> powder<00:04:29.340> itself<00:04:29.820> isn't

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
is that the pumice powder itself isn't

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.520 
is that the pumice powder itself isn't
just<00:04:30.630> being<00:04:30.990> pushed<00:04:32.090> into<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.480> grain<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
just being pushed into the grain the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.460 
just being pushed into the grain the
pumice<00:04:35.010> powder<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:36.180> grinding<00:04:36.900> away<00:04:37.020> at<00:04:37.230> the

surface so what you're getting going

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.980 
surface so what you're getting going
into<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.960> grain<00:04:43.260> is<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.940> combination<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.090> the

wood are helping to color the pumice to
stain<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.960> pumice<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.340> eventually<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
stain the pumice so that eventually the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.520 
stain the pumice so that eventually the
grain<00:05:20.130> will<00:05:20.820> be<00:05:20.970> completely<00:05:21.419> filled<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.380> this

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
grain will be completely filled and this

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.750 
grain will be completely filled and this
is<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:22.710> slow<00:05:23.070> process

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
is a slow process

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.219 
is a slow process
this<00:05:24.270> could<00:05:24.510> take<00:05:24.720> me<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:26.430> majority<00:05:27.090> of

this could take me the majority of

this could take me the majority of
another<00:05:28.229> day<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:30.150> do

I'm<00:05:46.120> using<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.510> special<00:05:47.260> power<00:05:47.530> polish<00:05:48.040> I've

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
I'm using the special power polish I've

I'm using the special power polish I've
diluted<00:05:49.120> about<00:05:49.390> fifty-fifty<00:05:50.320> with<00:05:50.350> with

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
some of these cotton wool pads you can

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.050 
some of these cotton wool pads you can
use<00:05:59.560> cotton<00:05:59.830> weights<00:06:00.220> but<00:06:00.430> I've<00:06:00.580> found<00:06:00.910> over

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
use cotton weights but I've found over

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.600 
use cotton weights but I've found over
the<00:06:01.240> years<00:06:01.270> that<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.920> caramel<00:06:03.310> works

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
the years that the the caramel works

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.210 
the years that the the caramel works
only<00:06:03.880> better<00:06:04.180> for<00:06:04.450> me<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:05.650> then<00:06:06.610> I<00:06:08.100> wake<00:06:09.100> up

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
only better for me and then I wake up

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.310 
only better for me and then I wake up
this<00:06:09.370> little<00:06:09.670> pad<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:12.960> off<00:06:13.960> we<00:06:14.140> go

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
this little pad and off we go

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.280 
this little pad and off we go
and<00:06:14.620> what<00:06:14.770> you're<00:06:14.920> doing<00:06:15.310> is<00:06:15.940> you're<00:06:16.930> pressing

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
and what you're doing is you're pressing

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.600 
and what you're doing is you're pressing
down<00:06:17.520> fairly<00:06:18.520> firmly<00:06:19.950> small<00:06:20.950> circular

down fairly firmly small circular

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.030 
down fairly firmly small circular
motions<00:06:21.820> and<00:06:22.360> you'll<00:06:23.260> be<00:06:23.410> putting<00:06:23.740> on<00:06:23.920> a

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
motions and you'll be putting on a

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.080 
motions and you'll be putting on a
microscopic<00:06:25.020> coat<00:06:26.020> of<00:06:26.320> shellac<00:06:26.790> the<00:06:27.790> pressure

microscopic coat of shellac the pressure

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.860 
microscopic coat of shellac the pressure
is<00:06:28.570> helping<00:06:29.140> the<00:06:29.950> the<00:06:30.370> coats<00:06:31.030> bond<00:06:31.480> with<00:06:31.690> one

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
is helping the the coats bond with one

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.590 
is helping the the coats bond with one
another<00:06:31.930> so<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:32.800> fact<00:06:33.370> you<00:06:33.610> you<00:06:33.880> you<00:06:34.120> end<00:06:34.300> up

with French polishing so I'll be I'll be

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.290 
with French polishing so I'll be I'll be
putting<00:06:53.200> on<00:06:53.320> many<00:06:53.650> many<00:06:53.950> coats<00:06:55.950> this<00:06:56.950> way

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
putting on many many coats this way

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.620 
putting on many many coats this way

using the the Polish diluted about 50/50
until<00:07:02.350> I've<00:07:02.470> built<00:07:02.920> up<00:07:03.450> a<00:07:04.650> thickness<00:07:05.650> which<00:07:06.190> I

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
until I've built up a thickness which I

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.380 
until I've built up a thickness which I

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
feel happy with and during a session

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.240 
feel happy with and during a session
I'll<00:07:10.780> keep<00:07:11.020> doing<00:07:11.380> this<00:07:11.880> until<00:07:13.680> the<00:07:14.680> surface

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
I'll keep doing this until the surface

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.570 
I'll keep doing this until the surface
starts<00:07:16.090> to<00:07:16.210> feel<00:07:16.450> sticky<00:07:16.720> and<00:07:17.320> then<00:07:17.980> I'll<00:07:18.130> stop

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
starts to feel sticky and then I'll stop
