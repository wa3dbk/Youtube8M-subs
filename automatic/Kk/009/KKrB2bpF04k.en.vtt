much of an excessive recoil and that the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.420 
much of an excessive recoil and that the
gun<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.539> too<00:01:03.780> large<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.559> some<00:01:04.739> small<00:01:05.070> handed

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.929 
gun was too large for some small handed
agents<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.200> FBI<00:01:07.500> went<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.460> Smith<00:01:08.729> &amp;

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890 
agents so the FBI went back to Smith &amp;
Wesson<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:11.159> find<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> better<00:01:11.700> suitable<00:01:12.360> caliber

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
Wesson to find a better suitable caliber

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530 
Wesson to find a better suitable caliber
for<00:01:13.170> their<00:01:13.290> agents<00:01:13.740> after<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:14.970> research<00:01:15.299> and

S&amp;W this one is a hollow-point right

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.340 
S&amp;W this one is a hollow-point right
here<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> hollow-point
