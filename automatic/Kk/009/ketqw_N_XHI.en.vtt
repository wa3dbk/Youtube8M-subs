see what what that does a little bit
soon<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.840> gives<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> movement<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.360> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
soon that gives it movement and just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
soon that gives it movement and just
just<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.320> possible<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> win

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
but I've 11 but it's really difficult

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.399 
but I've 11 but it's really difficult
then<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:58.130> ball<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.460> do<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.600> need<00:02:00.899> hold<00:02:01.200> up

then go to ball you do not need hold up

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.190 
then go to ball you do not need hold up
anymore<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.280> delete<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:03.140> go<00:02:04.140> to

the same but i'm not even moving left at
all<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.260> plays<00:03:28.470> normal<00:03:29.010> except

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
all and you see it plays normal except

this<00:03:29.909> is<00:03:30.060> very<00:03:30.329> hard<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.659> beat<00:03:30.900> if<00:03:31.109> it's

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
this is very hard to beat if it's

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:41.200 
this is very hard to beat if it's
possible<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.639> very<00:03:33.030> hard

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.790 

see<00:03:42.210> that's<00:03:42.720> why<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.290> win<00:03:43.440> but<00:03:43.650> it
