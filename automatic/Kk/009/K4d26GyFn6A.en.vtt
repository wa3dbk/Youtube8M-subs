00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.289 
that know I've just recently
transitioned<00:00:13.590> from<00:00:13.830> Wendler<00:00:14.340> five-three-one

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
transitioned from Wendler five-three-one

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.180 
transitioned from Wendler five-three-one
initially<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.199> gonna<00:00:16.320> go<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> an<00:00:16.859> upper

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
initially I was gonna go to an upper

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.130 
initially I was gonna go to an upper
lower<00:00:17.400> routine<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> lot<00:00:18.660> however

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
lower routine that I like a lot however

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.349 
lower routine that I like a lot however
I<00:00:19.439> wanted<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.130> more<00:00:20.430> specialization<00:00:20.970> in

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
I wanted to get more specialization in

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
I wanted to get more specialization in
on<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> larger<00:00:22.199> muscle<00:00:22.500> groups<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
on some of the larger muscle groups so I

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.089 
on some of the larger muscle groups so I
decided<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> go<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.269> push-pull<00:00:25.019> lower<00:00:25.529> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
decided to go for push-pull lower so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.410 
decided to go for push-pull lower so
here<00:00:26.220> seeing<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:26.550> push<00:00:26.789> day<00:00:27.000> I'm<00:00:27.210> also

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
here seeing my push day I'm also

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.849 
here seeing my push day I'm also
lowering<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> weights<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.590> trying

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
lowering the weights a little bit trying

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
lowering the weights a little bit trying
to<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.609> higher<00:00:29.789> reps<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
to get a little bit higher reps out of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.569 
to get a little bit higher reps out of
here<00:00:30.630> anywhere<00:00:31.260> from<00:00:31.500> six<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> ten<00:00:32.219> where

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
here anywhere from six to ten where

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:46.240 
here anywhere from six to ten where
Wendler<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.239> typically<00:00:33.719> five<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.230> under

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.770 

so<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.820> second<00:00:48.180> exercise<00:00:48.570> which

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so here you see my second exercise which

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.549 
so here you see my second exercise which
is<00:00:48.809> weighted<00:00:49.230> dips

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is weighted dips

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.410 
is weighted dips
I<00:00:49.620> love<00:00:49.920> weighted<00:00:50.250> dips<00:00:50.399> however<00:00:50.790> sometimes<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I love weighted dips however sometimes I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
I love weighted dips however sometimes I
find<00:00:51.719> when<00:00:52.260> doing<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.710> push<00:00:53.100> days<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.610> my

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
find when doing these push days that my

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
find when doing these push days that my
shoulders<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> lot<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> work<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.230> well

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
shoulders get a lot of the work as well

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.920 
shoulders get a lot of the work as well
so<00:00:56.129> sometimes<00:00:56.370> dips<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.239> hurts<00:00:57.510> too<00:00:57.750> much

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
so sometimes dips just hurts too much

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.780 
so sometimes dips just hurts too much
but<00:00:58.290> I'm<00:00:58.440> gonna<00:00:58.589> try<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.800> work<00:00:59.040> my<00:00:59.190> way<00:00:59.339> back<00:00:59.579> up

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
but I'm gonna try to work my way back up

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.840 
but I'm gonna try to work my way back up
with<00:00:59.969> these<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.369> upper<00:01:05.550> chest<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
with these so my upper chest is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
with these so my upper chest is
something<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> focus<00:01:06.899> on<00:01:07.170> here

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
something I really want to focus on here

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.570 
something I really want to focus on here
it's<00:01:07.470> something<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:07.860> been<00:01:07.979> lagging<00:01:08.220> for

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it's something that's been lagging for

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's something that's been lagging for
me<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.940> long<00:01:09.180> time<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.259> to<00:01:10.320> start

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
me for a long time so I'm going to start

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.810 
me for a long time so I'm going to start
looking<00:01:10.800> at<00:01:10.860> doing<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> incline

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
looking at doing a lot of incline

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:40.450 
looking at doing a lot of incline
movements<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.930> here

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.490 

but<00:01:41.299> four<00:01:41.450> shoulders<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.810> decided<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.170> do<00:01:42.229> side

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
but four shoulders I decided to do side

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.109 
but four shoulders I decided to do side
laterals<00:01:42.979> only<00:01:43.190> because<00:01:43.400> my<00:01:43.430> front<00:01:43.790> delts<00:01:44.090> are

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
laterals only because my front delts are

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.520 
laterals only because my front delts are
already<00:01:44.390> feeling<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.780> from<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.170> pressing

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
already feeling it from all the pressing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.350 
already feeling it from all the pressing
movements<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:45.920> have<00:01:46.159> with<00:01:46.790> these<00:01:46.970> guys<00:01:47.180> you

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
movements I have with these guys you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.280 
movements I have with these guys you
want<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.600> make<00:01:47.750> sure<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:48.020> you're<00:01:48.140> putting

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
want to make sure that you're putting

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.719 
want to make sure that you're putting
your<00:01:48.500> pinkies<00:01:48.830> up<00:01:49.010> at<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> top<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
your pinkies up at the top of the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:02:04.320 
your pinkies up at the top of the
movement<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.270> really<00:01:50.450> hit<00:01:50.690> those<00:01:50.900> side<00:01:51.170> delts

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.640 

so<00:02:05.330> my<00:02:05.420> last<00:02:05.600> exercise<00:02:06.020> here<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.229> for<00:02:06.409> triceps

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
so my last exercise here is for triceps

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.290 
so my last exercise here is for triceps
occasionally<00:02:07.460> what<00:02:07.580> I'll<00:02:07.670> do<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:07.880> these

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
occasionally what I'll do on these

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.090 
occasionally what I'll do on these
splits<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:09.170> instead<00:02:09.470> of<00:02:09.530> doing<00:02:09.800> three

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
splits is instead of doing three

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.699 
splits is instead of doing three
exercises<00:02:10.759> for<00:02:11.180> chest<00:02:11.510> let's<00:02:11.780> say<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.200> might

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709
