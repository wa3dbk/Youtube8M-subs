information<00:02:10.340> right<00:02:10.850> now

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
information right now

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.180

so<00:02:11.720> I've<00:02:11.780> got<00:02:11.930> 20<00:02:12.230> seconds<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.800> place<00:02:13.010> it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
so I've got 20 seconds to place it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.060 
so I've got 20 seconds to place it
within<00:02:13.340> 4<00:02:14.240> 10<00:02:14.660> centimeters<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.530> contactless

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
within 4 10 centimeters of a contactless

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.820 
within 4 10 centimeters of a contactless

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
POS terminal and that transaction will

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.970

will<00:02:19.190> happen<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.820> be<00:02:19.970> authorized

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
will happen and be authorized

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.960 
will happen and be authorized
instantaneously<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> POS<00:02:22.580> terminal

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
instantaneously so the POS terminal

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.300 
instantaneously so the POS terminal
thinks<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.600> regular<00:02:24.200> credit<00:02:24.709> card<00:02:24.920> it
