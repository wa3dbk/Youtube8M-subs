00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 good friends of hdblog here we are al 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 confrontation confrontation between the three smartwatches 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 of the moment we have here on the left the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.809
 baby and we switch it on 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.590
 very fast for our little one 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:31.610
 sony smartwatch 2 and the gear here on the right 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 of samsung we go to 100 of all three 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 let's start immediately with the difference 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 the display is clear 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.310
 the time display is a display of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.080
 papers like the ebook ones 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.120
 reader if you read under each 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.430
 condition of light to a piece of furniture 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.310
 quite faint lighting that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.239
 serves to make it read at night and not 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:58.290
 it only changes daytime brightness 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.690
 smartwatch here with a display that is 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.970
 trans reflective lcd 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 sorry but I didn't match the samsung 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.560
 on the phone kay i did it i did it at 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.240
 flight I said sony with a display on from 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.149
 1.1.6 inches transmitted even him yes 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.119
 read under the sunlight you see here 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.850
 a little less fable but still reads 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.219
 the clock is always active and so is he 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.380
 speak denomination to activate 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.659
 unlike the sony is that it is touchscreen 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 which instead of febo uses the keys for 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.420
 move up and down or the button 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.899
 central to even enter the verse 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.249
 samsung galaxy gear had here the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.959
 difference is substantial because the 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.459
 display is a super amoled then 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.229
 certainly more brilliant when it is 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:51.270
 turned on by the other two surely by 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.590
 more beautiful colors more bright but to one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.320
 substantial difference that the display 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.149
 the deal goes out while the other two go off 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.350
 therefore always remain on if those 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.119
 two others do not need to move the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.039
 wrist to read the time I can read 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.380
 a situation here i have to do a 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.840
 wrist movement to go to the center 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.280
 and they will wear them now one later 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.590
 the other that to show how they are 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.360
 on the wrist you see this I have to turn and the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.790
 internal sensor turns on the display 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.530
 as for portability they are 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.650
 all three very wearable a lot 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.390
 light gear to the most like the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.160
 camera is a function that acts 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.370
 will last to do as a speakerphone for 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.940
 the phone is a function that comes a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.709
 little snubbed a little criticized or mocked by 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.150
 by many but actually I have it 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.010
 long tried is a very function 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.170
 very convenient because we often find ourselves 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.549
 even to work maybe with sleeves are 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.129
 doing something they are typing 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.410
 on the keyboard fair I can talk to the 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.069
 wrist in a very comfortable way 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.650
 the sony on the wrist maybe what is 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.110
 in quotes a little worse because it is the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.299
 plus the biggest know of the three lo 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.989
 we put it immediately with his strap in 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.970
 silicone runs in less elegant though with 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.519
 his aluminum case and his 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.760
 touchscreen display is still his 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.000
 nice figure look at your wrist 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.280
 ability to receive notifications 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.900
 obviously a chance to start vibrates 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.940
 and end a call to read the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.420
 sms 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.730
 in short it basically acts as an extender 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.810
 phone and notify us of things 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.460
 obviously you can also use it as 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.710
 sports watch that shows us the 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.230
 performance we're getting 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.440
 during a run or during an exit 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.570
 by bike the paywall put him too 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.670
 if I can also do it with the strap in 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.900
 silicone glue of the most three 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.090
 wear because it is the lightest 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.830
 really a featherweight at practically 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.790
 wrist does not feel perhaps the most elegant 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.370
 I really like it too, it works 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.800
 only as a practically notifier 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.450
 we can also with with him and with too 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.400
 the others can go and check 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:07.810
 the music use it as an alarm 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.750
 both the bubble and the sony can be 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.620
 used to silence the phone 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.979
 to change the status of the tea like 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.959
 vibration ringtone or minute thing 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.130
 that samsung cannot yet do but on 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.039
 saint they are knowing so many 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.410
 applications and every day I find of 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.300
 new samsung that can do a lot though 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.039
 more things for example I can take 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.289
 the notes of averno directly from 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.630
 watch as I said before I can 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.990
 take photographs as swipe towards the 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.900
 bass 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.690
 photographs that also come quite 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:46.750
 well a good quality pedometer for 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.789
 use the phone as a sensor for 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.080
 the fitness studied two can not do 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.260
 this at least there are not now 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.130
 applications that exploit this to 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.750
 word a bit of three requirements 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.669
 basic meat with a smartwatch 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.830
 let's start with the battery then the 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.180
 samsung if used intensively vi 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.460
 will complete the day complete without 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.289
 problems the second maybe you will struggle 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.470
 to feel specialized often 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.139
 pedometer and handsfree the sony allows 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.870
 to do 4 5 days of use always 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.789
 intense but obviously doing only from 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.979
 notifications or by command for it 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.630
 smartphone will use less e 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.729
 especially the back lit mine 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.150
 team and you will use less because the 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.530
 reflective tran display will ensure that 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.570
 then slay and always choose the 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.270
 pebble and what he uses that he gave me 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.550
 more than seven seven days of intensive use 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.030
 that does with all the notifications enabled 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.810
 because the display this paper consumes 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.470
 far less than the excuse but 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.240
 the other two 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.630
 regarding water resistance 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.729
 then for ball and sony me I tested 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.560
 both in the pool looks like a water heater either 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.659
 in the shower they wash their hands not 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.110
 have had problems are both ip57 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.930
 then waterproof 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.720
 the gear instead and it was only for 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.880
 the sketches seen that at a certain value 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.620
 I didn't take him to the pool and I did n't 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.890
 brought over sweet he saw that indeed 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.120
 it is not meant for this purpose 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.630
 we are talking about value 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.030
 some prices 299 for the gear 189 for 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.230
 the sony and the 150 dollars because it increases 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.490
 only on get the in 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.530
 the pebble so let's say that fable e 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.750
 sony more or less aligned the gear has 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.300
 really one more step for what 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.940
 concerns the price 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.380
 the third the third requirement 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.620
 readability under the sun comes 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.810
 absolutely guaranteed by all three 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.730
 under the sun in any so 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.130
 happy display is shown 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.110
 very well the first two though where it is 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.540
 we see also here the display is seen 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.460
 always clock always on then 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.630
 no problem regarding the 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.720
 place movement the first one 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.610
 start you have to move your wrist to 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.129
 centralize then to read the display 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.189
 I repeat the display you see 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:00.459
 under any light condition what is the 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:02.539
 best beigua depends on needs 

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:05.209
 samsung is not sorry for me 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.539
 brilliant hands-free function instead second 

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:08.089
 myself 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:10.819
 poor battery life ea 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:13.610
 times the thousand functions that are useless 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:16.879
 been implemented first on all the 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.099
 camera function between sony and 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.239
 febo are two excellent mi products 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:22.309
 like both especially for 

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.659
 regarding battery life 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:26.419
 I prefer fair board because 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:28.699
 slightly more visible under the light 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:30.800
 of the sun and has a battery that lasts one 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.080
 a little bit more than a little more 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.819
 portability in my opinion the best is 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.429
 slightly lighter marson e 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:40.999
 however, if he gets along very well he is a 

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:43.389
 great smartwatch for hdblog andrea 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.389
 galeazzi
