00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
we're going to do a little sample using

we're going to do a little sample using
an<00:00:02.909> oil<00:00:03.120> glaze<00:00:03.480> here<00:00:03.929> or<00:00:04.140> oil<00:00:04.470> scumble<00:00:05.040> now

traditionally<00:00:06.270> we<00:00:06.629> thin<00:00:07.410> that<00:00:07.560> out<00:00:07.710> with<00:00:08.010> some

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
traditionally we thin that out with some

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.749 
traditionally we thin that out with some
white<00:00:08.460> spirit<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.469> some<00:00:10.469> color<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.730> use

oil-based<00:00:12.330> eggshell<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:13.080> color<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.620> this

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
oil-based eggshell for color but in this

consistency that I'm happy with I it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.590 
consistency that I'm happy with I it
should<00:00:30.539> feel<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.050> half<00:00:31.740> cream<00:00:32.300> that's<00:00:33.300> just

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
should feel like half cream that's just

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
should feel like half cream that's just
come<00:00:33.750> out<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> fridge<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.190> going

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
come out of the fridge so I'm just going

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.069 
come out of the fridge so I'm just going
to<00:00:38.430> brush<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.030> over<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> panel<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.969> now

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
to brush this on over the panel here now

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
to brush this on over the panel here now
you'll<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> looks<00:00:43.680> fairly<00:00:44.190> dark<00:00:44.690> but

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you'll see that it looks fairly dark but

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.150 
you'll see that it looks fairly dark but
as<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.350> taking<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
as we're going to be taking some of it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.750 
as we're going to be taking some of it
off<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:49.559> let<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> background<00:00:50.250> show<00:00:50.489> through

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
off to let the background show through

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.720 
off to let the background show through
from<00:00:50.969> underneath<00:00:52.280> we'll<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> nice

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
from underneath we'll get a nice

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
from underneath we'll get a nice
contrast<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.829> now<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.039> not

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
contrast with this now it's not

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.389 
contrast with this now it's not
important<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.079> too<00:00:58.379> even<00:00:58.770> because

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
important to have this too even because

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.799 
important to have this too even because
we<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> mess<00:01:00.149> around<00:01:00.300> quite<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> lot

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we are going to mess around quite a lot

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:16.370 
we are going to mess around quite a lot
with<00:01:01.140> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.140 

so<00:01:17.340> something<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.810> right

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
so something like that is about right

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.530 
so something like that is about right
and<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.299> brush<00:01:21.810> down<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.000> case<00:01:24.240> I'm

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and a brush down and in this case I'm

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
and a brush down and in this case I'm
using<00:01:24.600> some<00:01:25.200> muck<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> cloth<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
using some muck and cloth now it's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
using some muck and cloth now it's
important<00:01:27.180> before<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.659> start<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
important before you start that you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
important before you start that you
actually<00:01:29.119> charge<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.450> mutton<00:01:30.720> cloth<00:01:30.960> with

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
actually charge the mutton cloth with

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
actually charge the mutton cloth with
some<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.710> glaze<00:01:31.920> mixture<00:01:32.430> otherwise<00:01:32.580> it's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
some of the glaze mixture otherwise it's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
some of the glaze mixture otherwise it's
too<00:01:33.060> dry<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.810> it'd<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.380> putting

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
too dry and it'd be like putting

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370 
too dry and it'd be like putting
blotting<00:01:35.340> paper<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.690> way<00:01:36.899> hopefully

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
blotting paper on so this way hopefully

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.560 
blotting paper on so this way hopefully
this<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:37.890> start<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.250> slide<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this will now start to slide over the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460 
this will now start to slide over the
glaze<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:41.520> using<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.390> dabbing<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
glaze and just using it a dabbing and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
glaze and just using it a dabbing and
twisting<00:01:43.890> action<00:01:44.039> with<00:01:44.580> your<00:01:44.759> wrist<00:01:47.270> let's<00:01:48.270> go

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
twisting action with your wrist let's go

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.730 
twisting action with your wrist let's go
over<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.869> surface<00:01:49.289> until<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.830> fairly<00:01:50.250> even

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
over the surface until it's fairly even

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
over the surface until it's fairly even
don't<00:01:52.740> worry<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.100> little<00:01:53.399> inconsistencies

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
don't worry about little inconsistencies

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
don't worry about little inconsistencies
because<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.170> add<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> overall

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
because they all add to the overall

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:09.229 
because they all add to the overall
effect<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.759> simple<00:02:08.970> as

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
effect and it is really as simple as

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:09.740 
effect and it is really as simple as
that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
that
I'll<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.410> take<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.799> tape<00:02:11.100> off<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.230> we

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I'll just take this tape off so that we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.009 
I'll just take this tape off so that we
can<00:02:13.680> see<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> contrast<00:02:14.310> between<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.150> base

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
can see the contrast between the base

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.660 
can see the contrast between the base
color<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.519> glaze<00:02:17.730> color<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:20.160> hopefully

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
color and the glaze color and hopefully

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:34.350 
color and the glaze color and hopefully
it'll<00:02:20.850> come<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.120> quite<00:02:21.480> nicely

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.960 

now<00:02:35.360> again<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.530> finished<00:02:36.860> result<00:02:37.790> of

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
now again that's the finished result of

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.390 
now again that's the finished result of
the<00:02:38.150> paint<00:02:38.510> finish<00:02:38.720> we'd<00:02:39.620> leave<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.190> dry

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the paint finish we'd leave that to dry

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.630 
the paint finish we'd leave that to dry
for<00:02:40.460> 24<00:02:40.760> hours<00:02:41.660> at<00:02:41.810> least<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.320> then<00:02:42.980> apply<00:02:43.370> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
for 24 hours at least and then apply a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.400

I'm just going to show you how to do a

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.990 
I'm just going to show you how to do a
very<00:03:01.200> simple<00:03:01.470> grained<00:03:02.129> effect<00:03:02.550> using

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
very simple grained effect using

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.680 
very simple grained effect using
oil-based<00:03:03.870> glazes<00:03:05.030> here's<00:03:06.030> one<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.209> prepared

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
oil-based glazes here's one I prepared

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.640 
oil-based glazes here's one I prepared
earlier<00:03:06.900> always<00:03:07.830> wanted<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.250> say<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:09.650> I'm

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
earlier always wanted to say that I'm

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.710 
earlier always wanted to say that I'm
actually<00:03:10.890> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> use<00:03:11.690> two<00:03:12.690> different

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
actually going to use two different

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.880 
actually going to use two different
tones<00:03:13.379> of<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.769> same<00:03:14.010> glaze<00:03:15.379> I'm<00:03:16.379> just<00:03:16.620> putting

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
tones of the same glaze I'm just putting

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.990 
tones of the same glaze I'm just putting
on<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:18.950> lighter<00:03:19.950> color<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:20.730> going<00:03:20.940> to

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
on the lighter color that I'm going to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
on the lighter color that I'm going to
use<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:22.140> brushing<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.980> don't<00:03:23.160> have

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
use just brushing it on you don't have

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.470 
use just brushing it on you don't have
to<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:24.140> too<00:03:25.140> careful<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.099> just<00:03:26.549> get<00:03:27.360> it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
to be too careful with this just get it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.949 
to be too careful with this just get it
onto<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.780> surface<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:29.569> then<00:03:30.569> we'll<00:03:30.750> play

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
onto the surface and then we'll play

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:40.550 
onto the surface and then we'll play
with<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.260> later<00:03:38.540> they<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.569> brush<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.049> out<00:03:40.319> so

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
with it later they just brush it out so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.289 
with it later they just brush it out so
that<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:40.860> not<00:03:41.010> too<00:03:41.250> thick<00:03:47.120> something<00:03:48.120> like

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
that it's not too thick something like

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.470 
that it's not too thick something like
that<00:03:51.290> here<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.560> slightly<00:03:53.000> darker<00:03:54.000> color

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that here it's a slightly darker color

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.020 
that here it's a slightly darker color
it's<00:03:54.900> exactly<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.500> same<00:03:55.680> glaze<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> little<00:03:56.340> bit

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
it's exactly the same glaze a little bit

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.240 
it's exactly the same glaze a little bit
more<00:03:57.209> color<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.230> I'll<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.590> run<00:03:59.040> this

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
more color in it so I'll just run this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.080 
more color in it so I'll just run this
down<00:03:59.849> through<00:04:00.299> here<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.950> as<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.459> can<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:02.910> a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
down through here and as you can see a

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.750 
down through here and as you can see a
little<00:04:03.359> bit<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.630> color<00:04:03.920> goes<00:04:04.920> quite<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> long

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
little bit of color goes quite a long

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:17.569 
little bit of color goes quite a long
way

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.069 

now<00:04:18.579> I'm<00:04:18.639> going<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.910> take<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.120> pencil<00:04:19.389> drag<00:04:19.900> up

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
now I'm going to take a pencil drag up

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.110 
now I'm going to take a pencil drag up
one<00:04:20.769> of<00:04:20.889> these<00:04:20.979> available<00:04:21.370> in<00:04:21.729> various<00:04:22.090> sizes

one of these available in various sizes

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.980 
one of these available in various sizes
but<00:04:22.750> any<00:04:23.050> brush<00:04:23.350> would<00:04:23.590> do<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.630> seem<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.780> favor

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
but any brush would do I seem to favor

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
these and I'll just drag it through the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.350 
these and I'll just drag it through the
surface<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> glaze<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.250> break<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.180> color

surface of the glaze to break the color

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.740 
surface of the glaze to break the color
up<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.690> little<00:04:31.870> bit

which we use just the very tips of the

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.430 
which we use just the very tips of the
brush<00:05:46.060> just<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.290> this<00:05:47.590> very<00:05:48.040> very<00:05:48.370> gently

stroking<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:50.740> very<00:05:51.130> carefully<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.290> will

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
stroking it very carefully and it will

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.940 
stroking it very carefully and it will
just<00:05:54.390> break<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.600> surface<00:05:56.020> up<00:05:56.230> break<00:05:56.650> up<00:05:56.800> the

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
timber just to make it look better I'll

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.080 
timber just to make it look better I'll
just<00:06:14.320> wipe<00:06:14.770> down<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:15.220> edges<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.730> try<00:06:15.940> and
