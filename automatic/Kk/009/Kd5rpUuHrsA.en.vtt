we<00:01:37.370> are<00:01:37.400> pushing<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:38.090> boundaries<00:01:38.480> of<00:01:38.570> what

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
we are pushing the boundaries of what

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.840 
we are pushing the boundaries of what

of physics but also what it can do and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.800 
of physics but also what it can do and
it's<00:01:46.640> important<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.150> we<00:01:47.300> understand<00:01:47.690> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's important that we understand that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.420 
it's important that we understand that
so<00:01:47.960> we<00:01:48.050> can<00:01:48.170> deploy<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.710> developing<00:01:49.130> new

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
so we can deploy it in developing new

so we can deploy it in developing new
products<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:50.060> often<00:01:50.360> see<00:01:51.050> people<00:01:51.080> with

products we often see people with

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
one or ten and they feel they've done

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.000 
one or ten and they feel they've done
most<00:01:56.480> of<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> work<00:01:56.750> actually<00:01:57.260> they<00:01:57.800> may<00:01:57.920> have

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
most of the work actually they may have

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.220 
most of the work actually they may have
had<00:01:58.130> most<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.550> inspiration<00:01:59.120> that<00:01:59.150> most<00:02:00.110> of

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
had most of the inspiration that most of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.530 
had most of the inspiration that most of
the<00:02:00.290> work<00:02:00.440> is<00:02:00.650> still<00:02:00.860> left<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.190> do<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:02.300> about

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
the work is still left to do it's about

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.500 
the work is still left to do it's about

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.310 
that's where I think
TTP<00:02:12.940> actually<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.360> quite<00:02:14.720> unique<00:02:14.990> because

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
TTP actually is is quite unique because

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.530 
TTP actually is is quite unique because
we<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.250> ability<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.970> these<00:02:17.150> crater

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
we have the ability to have these crater

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.090 
we have the ability to have these crater
motors<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.020> first<00:02:18.200> place<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> create

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
motors in the first place and to create

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.880 
motors in the first place and to create
genuinely<00:02:19.550> new<00:02:19.760> technology<00:02:20.380> but<00:02:21.380> also<00:02:21.440> the

genuinely new technology but also the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.770 
genuinely new technology but also the
ability<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.310> go<00:02:22.610> through<00:02:23.000> those<00:02:23.209> later<00:02:23.420> stages

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
ability to go through those later stages

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.650 
ability to go through those later stages
and<00:02:24.350> turn<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.740> into<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:25.070> commercially<00:02:25.820> realized

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
and turn it into a commercially realized

fantastic<00:02:31.550> ok<00:02:31.820> TTP<00:02:32.720> we're<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.739> company<00:02:34.489> full<00:02:34.940> of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
fantastic ok TTP we're a company full of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
scientists and engineers are in it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.750 
scientists and engineers are in it
because<00:02:41.570> they<00:02:42.140> enjoy<00:02:42.500> making<00:02:43.100> things<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
because they enjoy making things and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.030 
because they enjoy making things and
seeing<00:02:44.030> things<00:02:44.239> happen<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.650> think<00:02:45.830> there's

seeing things happen and I think there's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.220 
seeing things happen and I think there's
nothing<00:02:46.190> more<00:02:46.700> satisfying<00:02:47.239> really<00:02:48.019> than

nothing more satisfying really than

taking a technology that you've helped
to<00:02:50.989> create<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.620> develop<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.580> actually

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
to create and develop and actually

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520 
to create and develop and actually
seeing<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.300> being<00:02:53.540> manufactured<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.200> volume

seeing it being manufactured in volume

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.580 
seeing it being manufactured in volume
and<00:02:55.390> beyond<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.630> seeing<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.110> being<00:02:57.290> used

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and beyond that to seeing it being used

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.170 
and beyond that to seeing it being used
in<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.890> product<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.340> affects<00:02:58.730> people's<00:02:59.090> lives

manufacturing of high-volume products

manufacturing of high-volume products
