00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
and you can see it detects my gamepad

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.069 
and you can see it detects my gamepad
here<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:23.030> some<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.269> them<00:03:23.389> what<00:03:23.660> happens<00:03:23.930> when

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
input device so on certain emulators

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.319

that's when you're gonna select then

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.680 
that's when you're gonna select then
here<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.069> configure<00:03:34.400> all<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.389> different

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
here you can configure all the different

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.900 
here you can configure all the different
buttons<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.170> if<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.350> say<00:03:36.500> up<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.400> hit<00:03:37.549> up<00:03:37.760> on

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
buttons so if I say up and I hit up on

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.729 
buttons so if I say up and I hit up on
my<00:03:38.030> controller<00:03:38.450> then<00:03:39.049> I've<00:03:39.470> already

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
my controller then I've already

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.559 
my controller then I've already
calibrated<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.519> but<00:03:40.910> then<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.209> do<00:03:41.359> all<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
calibrated it but then you do all the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.750 
calibrated it but then you do all the
different<00:03:41.840> buttons<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.319> for<00:03:43.010> example<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:43.609> B

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
different buttons and for example for B

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.849 
different buttons and for example for B
I<00:03:43.790> actually<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.690> use<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.170> Y<00:03:45.350> button<00:03:45.650> on

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
I actually like to use the Y button on

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.000 
I actually like to use the Y button on
the<00:03:46.400> SNES<00:03:46.730> for<00:03:47.120> B<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.019> B<00:03:48.230> button<00:03:48.739> for

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the SNES for B and then the B button for

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.800 
the SNES for B and then the B button for
a<00:03:49.040> but<00:03:49.430> it's<00:03:49.790> all<00:03:49.970> personal<00:03:50.329> preference<00:03:50.510> you

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
a but it's all personal preference you

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.479 
a but it's all personal preference you
don't<00:03:51.109> have<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.500> program<00:03:51.709> them<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.220> exact

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
don't have to program them to the exact

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.680 
don't have to program them to the exact
buttons<00:03:52.790> they<00:03:52.910> will<00:03:53.030> work<00:03:53.180> with<00:03:53.209> whatever

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
buttons they will work with whatever

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.920 
buttons they will work with whatever
alright<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.829> here<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.819> an<00:03:55.970> example<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.750> me

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
alright and here is an example of me

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.059 
alright and here is an example of me
playing<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.319> game<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:57.739> I'm<00:03:57.829> going<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:57.980> hit

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
playing the game so I'm going to hit

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.009 
playing the game so I'm going to hit
start<00:03:58.459> right<00:03:58.639> here<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.150> I'm<00:03:59.599> gonna<00:03:59.720> go<00:03:59.870> ahead

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
start right here and I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.210 
start right here and I'm gonna go ahead
now<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.380> few<00:04:01.040> things<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.370> notice<00:04:01.579> is<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:03.049> is<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
now a few things to notice is the is the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.309 
now a few things to notice is the is the
visual<00:04:04.639> quality<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:05.180> mean<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:05.720> not<00:04:05.900> sure<00:04:06.139> how

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
visual quality I mean I'm not sure how

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.479 
visual quality I mean I'm not sure how
well<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.650> going<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.829> look<00:04:06.980> with<00:04:07.099> my<00:04:07.220> screen

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
well it's going to look with my screen

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.370 
well it's going to look with my screen
recorder<00:04:07.579> but<00:04:08.540> my<00:04:08.720> guess<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:08.959> it's<00:04:09.230> going<00:04:09.319> to

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
recorder but my guess is it's going to

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.640 
recorder but my guess is it's going to
look<00:04:09.530> pretty<00:04:09.650> darn<00:04:09.919> good<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.389> um<00:04:11.389> if<00:04:12.109> you<00:04:12.319> um

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
look pretty darn good and um if you um

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.259 
look pretty darn good and um if you um
the<00:04:12.889> sound<00:04:13.069> isn't<00:04:13.190> very<00:04:13.459> loud<00:04:13.819> but<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.060> can

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
the sound isn't very loud but you can

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.140 
the sound isn't very loud but you can
probably<00:04:14.630> hear<00:04:14.810> some<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.169> sound<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:16.150> see

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
probably hear some of the sound and see

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:32.460 
probably hear some of the sound and see
how<00:04:17.359> well<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.870> looks

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.770 

so<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.520> can<00:04:33.670> see<00:04:33.820> all<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.090> all<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.450> speeds

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
so you can see all that all the speeds

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.070 
so you can see all that all the speeds
are<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.110> exact<00:04:35.500> same<00:04:35.590> as<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.730> original<00:04:37.240> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
are the exact same as the original the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.500 
are the exact same as the original the
colors<00:04:38.320> actually<00:04:38.440> look<00:04:38.680> pretty<00:04:38.920> vivid

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
colors actually look pretty vivid

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.460 
colors actually look pretty vivid
probably<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> little<00:04:40.690> more<00:04:40.900> vivid<00:04:41.200> than<00:04:41.320> they

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
probably a little more vivid than they

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.050 
probably a little more vivid than they
doing<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.860> actual<00:04:42.190> console<00:04:42.580> version<00:04:42.910> which

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060
