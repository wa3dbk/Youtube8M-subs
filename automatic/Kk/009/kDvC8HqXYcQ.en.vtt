00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.320
 The sun rises in the hills Emitting its rays from above 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.540
 Warming up this beloved floor From past Francisco Morato 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 In the battle of daily life You never run away from your ideal 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.980
 For this is the motto that it boasts With all its personnel 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 The slogan of your flag That was given by able people 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.900
 And spiked with gold letters City of love and peace 

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:12.835
 From the far distant times To the present that I want well 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.440
 When you are still hope Of dear and dear Bethlehem 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.900
 The heroic past remains firm Without fear of what comes 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.540
 In the battle for glory You do not go one step further 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.360
 Time passes and new day comes. The plant is born, the flower blooms. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.040
 It's Morato following so steadfast Brotherhood in blood and sweat 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.600
 I am proud to be moratense And in your land to live 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:10.160
 Your name to me is sacred I will love you until you die
