00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
and this again Valley here there's just

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.380 
and this again Valley here there's just
a<00:02:14.420> bunch<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.780> us<00:02:14.959> spider<00:02:15.290> webs<00:02:16.180> cleaned<00:02:17.180> all

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:30.150 
a bunch of us spider webs cleaned all
those<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.780 

pretty<00:02:31.160> good<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.400> plan<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:34.970> do<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:37.460> plate

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
pretty good so I plan to do this plate

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.450 
pretty good so I plan to do this plate
here<00:02:38.090> sand<00:02:39.080> down<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.590> repaint<00:02:39.770> some<00:02:40.280> high

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
here sand down and repaint some high

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.110 
here sand down and repaint some high
jump<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:41.290> probably<00:02:42.290> do<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:42.770> side<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:46.120> think

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
jump a probably do this side and I think

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.240 
jump a probably do this side and I think
it's<00:02:47.330> through<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.870> -<00:02:47.930> just<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.560> matches

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.150 

decrease<00:02:52.250> everything<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:53.030> here<00:02:53.920> replace<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
decrease everything in here replace the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.640 
decrease everything in here replace the
broken<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> bracket<00:02:56.150> which<00:02:56.510> one<00:02:56.720> here<00:02:59.650> these

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
broken in a bracket which one here these

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.590 
broken in a bracket which one here these
I<00:03:03.190> guess<00:03:04.190> I'm<00:03:04.340> gonna<00:03:04.430> find<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.820> placement<00:03:05.360> see

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
I guess I'm gonna find the placement see

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.980 
I guess I'm gonna find the placement see
if<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.780> just<00:03:06.170> work<00:03:06.560> with<00:03:06.590> these<00:03:07.570> if<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.780> think

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
if I just work with these if I think

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.060 
if I just work with these if I think
just<00:03:09.230> about<00:03:09.410> had<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.710> to<00:03:11.590> clean<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.740> grates
