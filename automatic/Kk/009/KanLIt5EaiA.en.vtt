 Shizuoka Prefecture News 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.109
 here we go 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.539
 Miyazato came in third place 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.539
 There was no map 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 no. 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 I talked to it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.080
 That would be enough 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 That old reason 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.540
 I am also high 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.350
 But a torch relay will take place 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.280
 To be a member of this world 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.270
 It was said that it took for the scale continent 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.910
 I work under the influence of the on-site doctor 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 First round newcomer everywhere in this world 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 I am advancing this south road 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.520
 Still, those who will continue to throw up will also smoke 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.190
 Son by email 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.970
 that is 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.000
 Writer 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 There are people who are trying to stand up for that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.390
 Visit this 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.830
 After a hundred years 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.780
 Do it with your own feet and find out 15 gold 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.940
 I'm trying to save the world 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.240
 I have you 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.490
 This time despite being human 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.710
 with this 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.560
 If you have friends 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.610
 It's pretty good 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 I led the kanji and got a sumo wrestling 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.690
 Exploring the issue 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.500
 I'm doing a thread of fate 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 8 minutes and 23 seconds, which greatly exceeds the upper limit and lower limit 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.920
 Make it possible to get the previous sumo wrestling 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 Prove moisture 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.570
 It became a series of troubles 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:13.410
 now 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.559
 I think I said that 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.419
 Appeared in broba as soon as possible 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.569
 this 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.569
 From the morning 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.539
 Regressed to 17th place 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.229
 Become a ball 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 The council is you 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.909
 Same residence 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.909
 Suddenly 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.499
 free 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.289
 Mainly inward 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.559
 ... 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.559
 To that end, 33 people have come to here 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.069
 Open integration 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.359
 Quoter 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.689
 Is it really 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.689
 It turns out in Hanshin 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 It was reversed by the opportunity that it became such a figure 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.919
 1994 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.119
 Interview with President Nakatani 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.129
 We are good 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.129
 Swear growth 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.969
 If you really go 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 The first session sponsored by Michi Takano will not be usable 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.650
 2- 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.550
 Model business 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 I knew that 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.189
 There is also a way for anyone to pay off this number 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.189
 Is it really not 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.860

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.240

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.719

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.719
 Also human beings can be trusted 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.460
 Hey you 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.909
 Kazuto Takeshima 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.639
 Three times from two deaths 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.639
 1711 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.759
 I'm worried- 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.599
 I do not even go for us 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.639
 This year 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.909

 Middle strike
