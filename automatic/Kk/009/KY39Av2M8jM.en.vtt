 own customers a very high quality pasta 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.470
 quality made in Italy with the best 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.380
 grains with a bronze processing that 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.290
 gives the pasta a roughness that 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.100
 allows to retain the sauce 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.080
 regardless of the relationship you 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.060
 it is cooking or from the type of sauce 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.290
 or from or of the people who are in front of you

 you always work with extreme solidity 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.180
 because it is the car that takes you where 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.369
 you want to go basically this is 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.610
 what we wanted to do is 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.610
 create 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.640
 in our idea we thought between 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.490
 models that are the pasta shop 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.560
 just corner and the pasta point la 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.900
 difference there is substantial of these 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.930
 things is given by the accessories that 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.660
 allow our object to be 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.170
 cared in every detail to be able to 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.650
 make pasta inside several 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.840
 structures you can afford to cook 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.390
 all the pasta you see here without 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.430
 no problem for which with times of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.400
 very fast cooking pasta is always 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.930

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.150
 eat like we were ours 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.780
 sauces have been selected by a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.360
 our chef and create a great combination 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.630
 with ours with our typology of 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.660
 pasta with this homemade pasta one 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.000
 nice car to see a car 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.780
 created with noble materials with is steel 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.020
 created with details that make it 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.780
 also pleasant to the touch in its form 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.310
 in its roundness it would have been 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.930
 very simple to make kitchens 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.720
 instead we wanted traditional 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.110
 create pasta paste in the object 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.410
 corner an object that also had some 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.630
 visual peculiarities 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.490
 which then we branded for 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.590
 give an identity of pasta dishes but 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.490
 the object can speak for itself is not alone 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.490
 a car but is that an object 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.550
 the nice thing about pasta sauce and that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.410
 could also be a response to 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.290
 socio-economic crisis that is experiencing the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.690
 in fact our country is born from the idea of 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.030
 four complementary companies 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.240
 who wanted to create a new one 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.870
 business that can exploit the know-how 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.510
 of the same is a very important thing 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.420
 from giving consumers the chance 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.250
