00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.059 
this is slanted to the left and then you
can<00:03:26.010> take<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.310> tip<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.819> this<00:03:27.540> star<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.109> you

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
can take the tip of this star and you

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.800 
can take the tip of this star and you
could<00:03:29.220> slide<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.639> in<00:03:29.760> there<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.120> same<00:03:30.359> exact

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
could slide it in there the same exact

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:39.229 
could slide it in there the same exact
way<00:03:36.650> okay<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.709> there<00:03:38.549> we<00:03:38.579> have<00:03:38.849> three

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
way okay so there we have three

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.800 
way okay so there we have three
connected<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.049> we<00:03:40.590> take<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.859> fourth<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:41.810> do

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
connected and we take the fourth one do

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.320 
connected and we take the fourth one do
the<00:03:42.930> same<00:03:43.169> thing<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.620> slide<00:03:43.949> it<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.220> there

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.870 

okay<00:03:51.080> then<00:03:51.260> take<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.590> fifth<00:03:51.830> one<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:54.880> slide

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
okay then take the fifth one and slide

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.350 
okay then take the fifth one and slide
it<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.180> just<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:57.670> okay<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:58.730> if<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.090> fit

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
it in just like that okay so if you fit

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.940 
it in just like that okay so if you fit
everything<00:03:59.720> together<00:03:59.870> properly<00:04:00.320> then<00:04:00.710> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
everything together properly then the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.250

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.300 
into that open pocket and it's not going
to<00:05:32.450> fit<00:05:32.660> together<00:05:32.780> perfectly<00:05:33.230> there<00:05:34.130> might<00:05:34.280> be

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
to fit together perfectly there might be

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.550 
to fit together perfectly there might be
a<00:05:34.430> little<00:05:34.669> bit<00:05:34.760> of<00:05:34.850> a<00:05:34.910> space<00:05:35.210> here<00:05:35.600> but<00:05:36.320> it<00:05:36.440> will

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
a little bit of a space here but it will

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.890 
a little bit of a space here but it will
hold<00:05:36.830> your<00:05:37.130> super<00:05:37.520> Cherie<00:05:37.730> 10<00:05:38.000> together<00:05:38.180> so

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
hold your super Cherie 10 together so

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.990 
hold your super Cherie 10 together so
there<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.169> go<00:05:39.290> you<00:05:39.320> have<00:05:39.620> finished<00:05:40.070> this

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
there you go you have finished this

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.659 
there you go you have finished this
super<00:05:41.510> shuriken<00:05:42.440> all<00:05:43.160> right<00:05:43.310> so<00:05:43.430> if<00:05:43.550> you're

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
super shuriken all right so if you're

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.310 
super shuriken all right so if you're
going<00:05:43.820> to<00:05:44.000> throw<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.270> just<00:05:44.780> know<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.140> these

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
going to throw it just know that these

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.710 
going to throw it just know that these
things<00:05:45.500> are<00:05:45.710> not<00:05:45.890> made<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.280> withstand<00:05:46.720> being

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
things are not made to withstand being

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.170 
things are not made to withstand being
thrown<00:05:48.050> at<00:05:48.260> super<00:05:48.620> high<00:05:48.650> speeds<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.520> can<00:05:49.970> stay

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
thrown at super high speeds it can stay

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.120 
thrown at super high speeds it can stay
together<00:05:50.330> for<00:05:50.720> about<00:05:50.780> one<00:05:51.169> throw<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:51.919> it

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
together for about one throw and then it

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.370 
together for about one throw and then it
will<00:05:52.250> probably<00:05:52.700> come<00:05:53.120> apart<00:05:53.480> if<00:05:53.690> not<00:05:53.990> come

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
will probably come apart if not come

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.960 
will probably come apart if not come
apart<00:05:54.680> while<00:05:54.919> while<00:05:55.250> you're<00:05:55.400> throwing<00:05:55.760> it<00:05:55.850> and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
apart while while you're throwing it and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.810 
apart while while you're throwing it and
just<00:05:56.210> shoot<00:05:56.930> six<00:05:57.440> ninja<00:05:58.190> stars<00:05:58.430> across<00:05:58.729> the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
just shoot six ninja stars across the
