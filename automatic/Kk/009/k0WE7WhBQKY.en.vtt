00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
like that and cubes easy is one of the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.780 
like that and cubes easy is one of the
first<00:00:12.540> sites<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.349> them<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.759> here<00:00:14.759> I

first sites that have them so here I
have<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> personnel<00:00:15.839> cubes<00:00:16.470> told<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.920> that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
have it the personnel cubes told me that

of like a zhanchi so hope there's not a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.820 
of like a zhanchi so hope there's not a
knockoff<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> Zanjeer<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.410> kind<00:00:31.740> of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
straight out of the box that more you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.150 
straight out of the box that more you
has<00:00:57.000> changed<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.570> blue<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
has changed the blue this is more of a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.490 
has changed the blue this is more of a
lighter<00:00:59.550> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.210> honor<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> camera<00:01:01.350> can

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
lighter kind of honor of the camera can

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.799 
lighter kind of honor of the camera can
pick<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
pick it up but it's more of like a

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.359 
pick it up but it's more of like a
lighter<00:01:03.809> blue<00:01:04.199> compared<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> darker

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
lighter blue compared to this darker

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.649 
lighter blue compared to this darker
blue<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> leading<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.330> color

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
blue on the leading so here color

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
blue on the leading so here color
comparison<00:01:10.670> maybe<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> primary

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
comparison maybe it's just a primary

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.260 
comparison maybe it's just a primary
colored<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.159> think<00:01:14.159> they've<00:01:14.310> done<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.000> think

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
colored I think they've done I think

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.810 
colored I think they've done I think
they<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.570> change<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> shades<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> orange

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
they have change of shades the orange

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.080 
they have change of shades the orange
seems<00:01:18.150> slightly<00:01:18.390> lighter<00:01:18.869> oh<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.640> yeah

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
seems slightly lighter oh it's just yeah

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
seems slightly lighter oh it's just yeah
the<00:01:21.540> primary<00:01:21.780> colored<00:01:22.200> cube<00:01:22.439> maybe<00:01:22.650> that's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the primary colored cube maybe that's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
the primary colored cube maybe that's
why<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.420> first<00:01:24.689> turns<00:01:38.900> okay<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:39.960> it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
why it is so it first turns okay so it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.999 
why it is so it first turns okay so it's
really<00:01:40.590> dry<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.400> tell<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.770> quite

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
really dry I can tell and it's quite

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
really dry I can tell and it's quite
crunchy<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.700> crispy<00:01:44.909> right<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.049> reminds<00:01:46.439> me

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
yeah definitely it does turn really good

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.280 
yeah definitely it does turn really good
let's<00:02:02.520> take<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> look<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> mechanism<00:02:03.299> so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
let's take a look at the mechanism so

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.959 
let's take a look at the mechanism so
here<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> guys<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.430> mechanism

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
here you guys can see the mechanism

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
here you guys can see the mechanism
that's<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> holes<00:02:07.310> different<00:02:08.310> mechanism

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that's got the holes different mechanism

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
that's got the holes different mechanism
this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> totally<00:02:09.479> new<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.110> mechanism

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
this is a totally new more you mechanism

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.760 
this is a totally new more you mechanism
and<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> core<00:02:12.360> there<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and you can see the core there and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.880 
and you can see the core there and
the<00:02:14.210> centerpiece<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.390> quite<00:02:15.600> rounded<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.650> here

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the centerpiece is quite rounded so here

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.450 
the centerpiece is quite rounded so here
yes<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.340> c<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.910> corner<00:02:18.270> piece<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:20.130> kind

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
yes and c is the corner piece it's kind

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.890 
yes and c is the corner piece it's kind
of<00:02:20.550> more<00:02:21.260> sharper<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.650> design<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:24.660> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
of more sharper kind of design I think I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.360 
of more sharper kind of design I think I
don't<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:25.350> what<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.710> did<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.190> it's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
don't know what they did to it but it's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.000 
don't know what they did to it but it's
kind<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.640> everything<00:02:27.360> sing<00:02:27.720> sharper<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.500> not

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
kind of everything sing sharper and not

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.920 
kind of everything sing sharper and not
as<00:02:29.190> round<00:02:29.550> basically<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.330> here's<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> edge

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
as round basically so here's the edge

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.810 
as round basically so here's the edge
piece<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.410> guys<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.710> see<00:02:31.740> here<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.640> got

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
piece you guys can see here it's got

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.400 
piece you guys can see here it's got
holes<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:33.840> through<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.260> can

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
holes and you can see through you can

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.380 
holes and you can see through you can
see<00:02:34.590> where<00:02:34.710> my<00:02:34.800> fingers<00:02:35.220> through<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
see where my fingers through this and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.600 
see where my fingers through this and
yeah<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.140> does<00:02:37.200> feel<00:02:37.410> lighter<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.190> peace<00:02:38.370> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
yeah it does feel lighter the peace and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.940 
yeah it does feel lighter the peace and
the<00:02:38.670> standard<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.630> torpedo<00:02:40.020> uh-huh

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the standard kind of torpedo uh-huh

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.610 
the standard kind of torpedo uh-huh
that's<00:02:41.550> why<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.720> looks<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.230> angie

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
that's why so this looks like as angie

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.740 
that's why so this looks like as angie
from<00:02:43.710> here<00:02:44.010> yes<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.330> torpedoes

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
from here yes and see the torpedoes

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.280 
from here yes and see the torpedoes
rounded<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.390> other<00:02:48.600> more<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.110> wear

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
rounded not like the other more you wear

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.440 
rounded not like the other more you wear
the<00:02:49.470> torpedoes<00:02:49.980> more<00:02:50.280> rectangular<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.210> here's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the torpedoes more rectangular so here's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.780 
the torpedoes more rectangular so here's
the<00:02:51.660> corner<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.320> edge<00:02:52.560> pcs<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.340> see<00:02:53.550> here

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the corner and edge pcs in see here

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.670 
the corner and edge pcs in see here
there's<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.270> no<00:02:54.570> way<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.260> corner

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
there's just no way for this corner

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.200 
there's just no way for this corner
piece<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.010> move<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.640> torpedo<00:02:57.090> is

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
piece to move because the torpedo is

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.880 
piece to move because the torpedo is
slow<00:02:57.420> load<00:02:57.690> love<00:02:58.110> mean<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.380> lowered<00:02:58.710> down

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
slow load love mean like lowered down

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.800 
slow load love mean like lowered down
and<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.760> tell<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.120> cube<00:03:00.390> will<00:03:00.630> not

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and I can tell you this cube will not

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.660 
and I can tell you this cube will not
pop<00:03:01.050> because<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.770> corner<00:03:02.100> just<00:03:02.280> does<00:03:02.490> not

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
pop because the corner just does not

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.040 
pop because the corner just does not
move<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.120> maybe<00:03:03.480> that's<00:03:03.630> why<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.960> so

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
move and maybe that's why it's so

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.560 
move and maybe that's why it's so
crunchy<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.980> my<00:03:05.100> final<00:03:05.340> first<00:03:05.730> impressions<00:03:06.300> I
