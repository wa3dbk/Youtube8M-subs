 I welcome everyone behind the scenes, I Olga 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.560
 Mamistov aromatherapist and psychologist 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.160
 and the creator of the first international 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.509
 Internet Academy of Aromatherapy 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.200
 Today we will talk about how to choose 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:30.129
 quality essential oil what have 10 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.160
 rules for choosing to begin let's start 

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.719
 situation on the market of essential oils 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 since there are no government structures and 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.000
 adequately monitored quality 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.829
 essential oil market is crowded 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.860
 synthetics despite proudly shouting 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.840
 Labels 100% essential oil 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.329
 what does the store offer with ethnic 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.970
 chemical flavoring products 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.920
 shops with goods for bath and sauna 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.579
 also offer chemistry in most 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.530
 cases even in pharmacies 99 percent 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.829
 extremely low quality essential oils 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.930
 or just synthetics and condemn here 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.390
 nobody overwhelming sellers 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.119
 most even have no idea 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.999
 what are they under species of natural sell 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.780
 chemistry therefore so usefully without harm 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.329
 to the body 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.920
 deal with aromatherapy guided 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.630
 further proposed quality criteria 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.490
 since the market for essential oils is filled 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.009
 fakes it is very important to emphasize 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.399
 I want to ask you a little quality 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.810
 to disappoint in order to unmistakably 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.509
 identify high-quality essential oil 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.349
 need to see chromatograms with 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.869
 decoding and conclusion of a specialist 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:43.179
 in a nutshell, chromatography is a hardware 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.969
 method to determine the percentage 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.950
 chemical composition of the products nonetheless 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.259
 some reputable firms may not 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.869
 produce a similar document on various 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.999
 reasons therefore for beginners the best 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.219
 The way to determine quality is 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.979
 recommendation to experts and better 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.319
 several with experience may develop 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.509
 sense of smell and it will be easier to recognize 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.159
 one hundred percent counterfeit but even 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.860
 experienced aromatherapists 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.620
 do not rely only on their charm and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.610
 study the reputation of the supplier company 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.770
 raw materials and chromatograms of essential oils have 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.000
 some more criteria which are very 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.330
 relative but 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.980
 can help choose an essential oil 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.700
 first for most essential oils 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.680
 standard volume 5 10 milliliters 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.690
 Some firms spread options 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.410
 6 and 15 milliliters 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.220
 as well as a share of tuna one quarter 1 2 and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 other for expensive oils rose jasmine 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.630
 may be 1 2 milliliters second 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.360
 criterion 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.200
 dark glass bottle most often 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.330
 brown 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.970
 but you can meet the bottle and others 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.620
 colors blue green and so on if 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.350
 oil in a plastic bottle 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.820
 either in a clear glass, then this is a reason 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.100
 doubt its quality these criteria 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.800
 the bottle is equipped with a dropper or pipette 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.580
 except for small volumes 1 2 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.050
 milliliter fourth criterion cork with 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.420
 first opening ring 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.790
 either protected from simple opening like a 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.090
 medication fifth criterion 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.670
 on the label the name of the plant in Latin 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.120
 consisting of two words specific and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.250
 generic name for example citrus 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 sinensis 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.820
 this is the usual sweet orange and on the tongue 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.320
 trademark 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.519
 the sixth criterion on the label 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.230
 manufacturer and its address 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.709
 case of claims to product quality 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.739
 present at least to anyone 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.470
 the manufacturer should name it 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.070
 be present on the seventh label 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.829
 criterion 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.600
 there is a common myth that if 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.880
 what natural essential oil on 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.090
 paper then it is through a small gap 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.610
 time completely evaporate is not true 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.250
 the fact that the oil has completely evaporated sheet 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.290
 paper does not speak about its quality at times 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.010
 synthetic oils volatilize with 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.480
 paper is much faster than natural 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.820
 think if your oil is myrrh or 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.729
 patchouli evaporated without residue from the sheet 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.300
 paper or oil chamomile oil blue 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.070
 did not leave a blue trace a drop of oil on 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.380
 paper may give approximate information 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.840
 about diluted oil in bold 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.540
 solvent or not one hour after 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.240
 you drop the essential oil 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.060
 there must be a clearly greasy stain but 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.720
 note that some moscow is not completely 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.030
 steaming incense and myrrh and some more 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.790
 and color patchouli paper chamomile 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.040
 yarrow 8 criterion is not one 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.010
 plants can get essential oil 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.100
 so the banana strawberry essential oils and 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.790
 strawberry kiwi melon manga does not exist 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.040
 these are synthetic flavors 9 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.230
 price criteria can also serve 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.110
 quality benchmark 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.850
 Essential oil price mainly 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.730
 determined by percentage 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.430
 essential oil in vegetable raw materials 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.040
 the higher the percentage , the lower the cost 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.920
 for example ive qalib then this is three percent 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.710
 that means 100 kilograms of leaves 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.760
 gets up to 3 kilos of essential oil 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.740
 juniper is half a percent this 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.420
 that means 100 kilograms of berries 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:35.510
 get a pound of oil neroli is five 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.930
 hundredths percent of this means that out of a hundred 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:43.550
 kilograms of orange flowers gets 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.950
 50 grams of rose oil is three hundredths 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.080
 percent that means 100 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.200
 kilograms of petals get just 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.120
 only 30 milliliters of oil 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.190
 it is logical to conclude that the oil is rose and 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.860
 Neroli can not cost the same 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.890
 how much and eucalyptus oil on the shelves 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.790
 You can meet these oils for 100 and 200 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.150
 rubles for 10 milliliters naturally this 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:11.480
 counterfeit or fake focusing on 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.310
 these nine criteria and 10 criteria are 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.150
 recommendations of experts can 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.820
 pick high-quality essential oil
