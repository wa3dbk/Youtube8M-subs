00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.250 
and off the field and partnerships and
it's<00:00:20.730> great<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> boys<00:00:22.109> are

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
but being totally I'm three weeks and
Swansea<00:01:43.710> wasn't<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.130> great<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.670> honest

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
Swansea wasn't that great to be honest

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.230 
Swansea wasn't that great to be honest
but<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:47.460> had<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:47.970> Six

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
but now I was we had a pretty good Six

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389

Nations and coming into the tournament
we<00:01:50.759> were<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.570> quietly<00:01:51.990> confident<00:01:52.409> we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
we were I think quietly confident we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
we were I think quietly confident we
could<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.829> quite<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.850> had<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> reason<00:01:54.240> he

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
could do quite well we had a reason he

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.080 
could do quite well we had a reason he
tough<00:01:54.509> group<00:01:54.899> but

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
tough group but

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.460 
tough group but
it<00:01:56.270> was<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.450> real<00:01:56.659> quite<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:56.930> strong<00:01:57.200> team

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
it was a real quite a strong team

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.130 
it was a real quite a strong team
looking<00:01:57.799> back<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.280> yeah<00:01:59.119> we<00:01:59.270> got<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> good

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
looking back and yeah we got a good

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.560 
looking back and yeah we got a good
start<00:02:00.380> against<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> end<00:02:01.369> of<00:02:01.490> Japan<00:02:01.790> and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
start against it to the end of Japan and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.170 
start against it to the end of Japan and
I'm<00:02:02.689> at<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.869> pretty<00:02:03.619> big<00:02:04.009> match<00:02:04.490> against<00:02:04.880> round

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
I'm at a pretty big match against round

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.380 
I'm at a pretty big match against round
to<00:02:05.360> his<00:02:05.479> pretty<00:02:06.130> physical<00:02:07.130> affair<00:02:07.369> like<00:02:07.700> any

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
to his pretty physical affair like any

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.719 
to his pretty physical affair like any
normal<00:02:08.569> machi<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.170> French<00:02:09.440> team<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.920> we

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
normal machi as a French team and we

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.070 
normal machi as a French team and we
just<00:02:10.759> about<00:02:11.120> picked<00:02:11.360> him<00:02:11.510> at<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.690> end<00:02:11.810> there

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
just about picked him at the end there

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.820 
just about picked him at the end there
so<00:02:12.290> he's<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.920> great<00:02:13.730> comeback<00:02:14.239> by<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.510> boys

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
so he's a great comeback by the boys

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.710 
so he's a great comeback by the boys
something<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:17.030> thrived<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.510> at

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
something that I think we thrived on at

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.270 
something that I think we thrived on at
the<00:02:17.840> end<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.140> was<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.560> pressure<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.190> I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the end it was just that pressure and I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.370 
the end it was just that pressure and I
think<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:19.760> got<00:02:20.630> never-say-die<00:02:21.110> attitude

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
think we got never-say-die attitude

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.979 
think we got never-say-die attitude
would<00:02:22.069> be<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:23.269> France<00:02:23.510> was<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.900> an
