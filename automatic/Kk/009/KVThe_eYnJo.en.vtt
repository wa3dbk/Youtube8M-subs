00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 the main thing that worries every motorist 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 fuel quality raises the question a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 is it possible to dilute this car 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.529
 fuel as gas and gas cannot be reduced 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 because in all tank tanks 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.220
 he is under pressure therefore 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 just open the valve and anything 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.420
 pour there is simply unrealistic and secondly 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 the whole process of pumping gas is sealed and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 it is not gasoline in which you can easily 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.949
 add additives or any other 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.780
 liquid 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 gas pressure in tanks can 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 reach 10 atmospheres just try 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 so add to any liquid for example 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 in a household gas cylinder in the second 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.460
 usually unscrupulous suppliers 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.770
 gasoline diluted it on the way from 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 plant to the consumer in the case of gas 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.120
 this is excluded look from the tank 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 gas carriers in the tank filling 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.840
 gas stations come in tightly 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.180
 connected pipes have the same technology 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
 at the factory and when refueling cars 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.789
 no access to fuel directly 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.739
 By the way, there is an opinion that butane is 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 excess admixture like a thinner 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.020
 polluter is wrong heat 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 butane combustion is higher than propane 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.680
 so if you ride butane it 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.049
 consumption will be less than propane in 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.840
 south korea so do butane there 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.509
 gas is more cold and liquid butane 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.670
 boils no lower than zero degrees 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.740
 propane at minus 42 so that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.170
 persisted fuel pressure evaporated 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.720
 completely there is also a winter version of gas and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.450
 summer in winter mix about 90 percent 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.700
 propane and in its summer about 50 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.799
 percent when especially cold and gas 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 hardly evaporates full car 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 the tank is pumped up with nitrogen it creates 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 extra pressure helps 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.110
 gas movement using this technology 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.600
 only in extreme cold 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.119
 country time 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 I need not here itself as a 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.799
 known does not burn does not support 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.630
 burning so it does not affect either 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.090
 safety is not on the engine itself 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.009
 nitrogen is removed from the cylinder gradually 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.290
 about three or four gas stations 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.600
 by the way, and it applies to those cars 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.880
 which cylinder is installed outside if 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.489
 he is in the trunk of the car then he is nitric 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.640
 swap no need they took such 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.560
 way to dilute the gas is not there because swapping 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 nitrogen is produced on completely 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.220
 filled tank and gas stations 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.030
 terminal oil and gas this service 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.030
 is free
