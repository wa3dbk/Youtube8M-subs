00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.550 
it's very difficult capsaicin is found
in<00:01:30.610> many<00:01:31.060> different<00:01:31.150> types<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.869> hot<00:01:32.110> peppers

habanero<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.400> sort<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.640> thing<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.000> that

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
habanero that sort of thing and that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.530 
habanero that sort of thing and that
increases<00:01:35.590> your<00:01:35.770> heart<00:01:35.950> rate<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.880> induces

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
increases your heart rate it induces

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.499 
increases your heart rate it induces
sweating<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.799> increases<00:01:39.280> sensitivity<00:01:39.640> or

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
sweating and it increases sensitivity or

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.899 
sweating and it increases sensitivity or
nerve<00:01:41.079> endings<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.770> essentially<00:01:42.670> it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
nerve endings so essentially it

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.700 
nerve endings so essentially it
simulates<00:01:43.240> all<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.869> same<00:01:44.049> sort<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.470> things

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
simulates all the same sort of things

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.050 
simulates all the same sort of things
that<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:46.810> happening<00:01:47.439> when<00:01:48.009> you're<00:01:48.310> get<00:01:48.939> it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
off number three is celery we actually

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.010 
off number three is celery we actually
don't<00:01:55.000> have<00:01:55.090> any<00:01:55.270> celery<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.689> show<00:01:55.869> you

don't have any celery to show you

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.780 
don't have any celery to show you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
because I ate it already so celery

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.950 
because I ate it already so celery
actually<00:02:01.509> has<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.549> produces<00:02:04.180> in<00:02:04.509> your<00:02:04.719> body

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960
