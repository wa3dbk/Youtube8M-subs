00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.109
 yes, a new package is today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.900
 arrived and that's what i would 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.660
 Something special in any case 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.940
 my eyes I will first do now 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:28.250
 nothing to say and we pack the whole 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:30.480
 Let's just think of a few people 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.660
 will already know what it is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.660
 becomes 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.650
 and yes you see a new fair 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.229
 As you can see it is from Matthias bush 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:46.490
 and that is the fuck is useful 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:53.030
 Concrete near that now 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:02:01.070
 Handmade and that looks really cool 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:03.939
 It is also great in the hand 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.939
 like hangover handle 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.250
 we with homemade cold me 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:26.470
 Seems there is a little celebration style 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:27.820
 taken in and therefore there for that 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.780
 one that really seems inter forget 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:38.110
 You can and you always have fire 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.020
 practically so I will not 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.440
 I will continue to use my country 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.560
 use 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:51.240

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.240

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.300
 Try and then I do it 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.459

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.440
