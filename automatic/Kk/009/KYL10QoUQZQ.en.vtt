00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.130 
it cups down and provides some support
so<00:03:58.579> that<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.940> fly<00:03:59.269> floats<00:03:59.629> right<00:03:59.720> in<00:04:00.019> the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
so that this fly floats right in the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.180 
so that this fly floats right in the
surface<00:04:00.500> film<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.819> only<00:04:02.060> trick<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.390> that

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
surface film and the only trick is that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.280 
surface film and the only trick is that
you're<00:04:04.190> winding<00:04:04.489> down<00:04:06.370> towards<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.549> hook

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
you're winding down towards the hook

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.039 
you're winding down towards the hook
each<00:04:09.290> wrap<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.920> hackle<00:04:10.420> underneath<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.870> one

each wrap of hackle underneath the one

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.440 
each wrap of hackle underneath the one
prior<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.859> pushing<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.879> prior<00:04:14.120> wraps

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
prior to it pushing the the prior wraps

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.090 
prior to it pushing the the prior wraps
up<00:04:15.220> fairly<00:04:16.220> loose<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:17.139> then<00:04:18.139> pull<00:04:18.680> them<00:04:18.829> tight

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
up fairly loose and then pull them tight

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.939 
up fairly loose and then pull them tight
as<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.400> come<00:04:19.609> around<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:21.520> I'm<00:04:23.620> applying<00:04:24.620> more

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
as you come around and I'm applying more

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.390 
as you come around and I'm applying more
hackle<00:04:25.460> than<00:04:25.910> most<00:04:26.210> people<00:04:26.539> are<00:04:26.660> used<00:04:26.960> to
