 in relation to the average Brazil 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.260
 a minor band is considered 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.460

 more if we compare with some countries of symbolisms 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.570
 that rate is from san paolo aínda can be considered elevated 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.479
 and there just in a Latin American context 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.530
 countries

 as if it stung him cuba to present indexes to the vacuum dt is per thousand 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.629
 with this performance the mortals of the aforementioned service I compose 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:12.579
 in the regions 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.429
 from sao paolo meet no 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 significant differences 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:18.709

 half country 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.309
 you want to take significant actions to reproduce those 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.409
 indicators 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.180
 congiu tegucigalpa to be canceled after towing another dimension

 as a country between states 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.410
 It is calculated annually 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.950
 already for minogue arias 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.419
 d occurrences of deaths and live births of 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.719
 to him it is often necessary to group

 those numbers for patiño yes in a significant way 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.969
 7 we could say that sometimes some fishermen indicate 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.929

 in total five Cubans after the first shipment of municipalities 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.719
 it is possible to calculate the rate by municipalities 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:59.409
 more first we wanted to verify if the foot those systems born 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.539
 alive and of deaths we are really catching all the events 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:05.809
 Secondly 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.140
 in necessary percent 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.540
 di pietro popular been the party decide in that municipality 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.889
 It was a reasonable size 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.839
 parasite an idea the committee of the audience to ponce de león 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.659
 in ap ocular second municipality 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.740

 jail and fine 18-inch 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.779
 yes we can also calculate 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.409
 p keep double restrictions 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.399
 the whistle previously or that the system capel the events of births 

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.759
 and of death 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.149
 and that the skate size second morrazo population size 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.749
 yet we have to find crises and maxims of these cases 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.969
 aap 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.090
 for or state of san pablo 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.140
 municipalities 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.710

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.080
 those infant mortality rates you can find the fluff and train the foundation 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.610
 cear 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.490
 for the states 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.610
 2 Brazil 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.310
 we can not find those indicators in that bowl dispute 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.059
 and in that very beautiful idea 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.949
 for mortality rate tends countries 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.490
 can be found from iceta press
