00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.350
 pool new trout farm in the test 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.019
 mode already started fry in bykovsky 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.360
 the region is ready to grow 300 tons per year 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.730
 Delicious fish in the object already invested 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.830
 80 billion rubles and costs more 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 a lot of picky trout are coming 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 requires perfectly clean saturated 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.949
 heated water and even oxygen 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.350
 a certain flow rate and such 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.060
 conditions due to energy costs are expensive 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 will inevitably affect the cost 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.760
 products 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 but fish water believe that the Belarusian 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 fresh trout can 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.640
 compete frozen imported 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 fish that is in deep 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.219
 freezing her part of the useful properties 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.739
 substances are lost we will have that is 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.920
 You can say so all year fresh 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.320
 Trout is still unknown at 250 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.170
 gram either 400 gram or 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.079
 kilogram respectively from this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280
 the beach and the boy with the problem of selling lights 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 you housekeeping babich 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 already encountered fish irrigating 15 tons 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 even had to carry in the capital 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 now he wonders what to do when the first 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.119
 the catch will be gathered by competitor colleagues in this 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.280
 year only in the Mogilev region 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.590
 will open several new trout 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.869
 complexes and it is almost 700 tons 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 Delicious fish per year that is 40 times 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.409
 more than they grow now 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 babicha sell trout at a loss 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 no one will be in stores today 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 price per kilogram of expensive fish 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.860
 exceeded 100 thousand rubles 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 everything will depend on the cost price 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 which will be folded if 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.329
 cost you big of course will 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.440
 problems with implementation and if you engage 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 purposefully 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.260
 on technology cost of fish can 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.720
 20-30 percent decrease by 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.250
 Fisheries Development Program 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.950

 8 fish complexes 3 injected this year in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 perspective five more unfortunately project 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.390
 implemented based formally 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.940
 drawn up business plans that night 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 when preparing two years ago 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.520
 pawned completely unreal 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.770
 numbers for example read that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.650
 the cost of brewing will be about 25,000 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.140
 sales markets in general I'm not 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.580
 worked no one did the analysis 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 how much could an HF anin and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.750
 Belarusian eats the very trout you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.580
 control proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.950
 postpone the construction of a new slave 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.810
 complexes and means and efforts to direct 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.640
 on the study of demand and development 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.350
 recycling from the same freeze to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 smoking to your own words 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.390
 production of caviar and karma can make 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.070
 trout available to buyers until all 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.260
