presenting<00:02:06.840> anything<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> Bordelaise

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.790 

hmm

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400 

here<00:02:22.370> comes<00:02:22.550> his<00:02:22.700> first<00:02:22.940> play<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:24.350> a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
here comes his first play and it's a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.710 
here comes his first play and it's a
heckling<00:02:24.740> feens<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.340> can<00:02:26.120> deal<00:02:26.240> with<00:02:26.420> hoechlin

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
heckling feens I can deal with hoechlin

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:38.400 
heckling feens I can deal with hoechlin
beans<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:28.450> think<00:02:31.210> that's<00:02:32.210> not<00:02:32.420> great<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> I

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
beans I think that's not great so I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.080 
beans I think that's not great so I
could<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.620> pass<00:02:39.980> here<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:42.820> then<00:02:43.820> try<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
could just pass here and then try and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.910 
could just pass here and then try and
get<00:02:44.300> them<00:02:44.390> with<00:02:44.510> moment<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.900> heroism<00:02:45.140> if<00:02:45.800> he

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
get them with moment of heroism if he

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.800 
get them with moment of heroism if he
tries<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.160> make<00:02:46.370> me<00:02:46.400> attack<00:02:46.760> or<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.570> can<00:02:47.780> just

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
tries to make me attack or I can just

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
tries to make me attack or I can just
block<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.710> then<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.280> moment<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.700> he<00:02:49.760> has<00:02:49.880> a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
block and then if I moment and he has a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.430 
block and then if I moment and he has a
trick<00:02:50.270> that's<00:02:50.420> pretty<00:02:50.690> bad<00:02:50.870> for<00:02:51.140> me<00:02:51.290> though

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
trick that's pretty bad for me though

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.270 
trick that's pretty bad for me though
yeah<00:02:54.440> i'm<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:54.770> going<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:54.920> trade<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.280> damage

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
yeah i'm just going to trade to damage

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.440 
yeah i'm just going to trade to damage
he<00:02:58.280> could<00:02:58.370> also<00:02:58.520> have<00:02:58.700> crossway<00:02:59.060> vampires

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
he could also have crossway vampires

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.540 
he could also have crossway vampires
which<00:02:59.690> would<00:02:59.840> make<00:02:59.990> leaving<00:03:00.980> or<00:03:01.220> turds<00:03:01.370> beer

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
which would make leaving or turds beer

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.010 
which would make leaving or turds beer
back<00:03:01.760> pretty<00:03:02.210> bad<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:05.270> we'll<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.450> bash<00:03:05.780> and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
back pretty bad so we'll just bash and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.100 
back pretty bad so we'll just bash and
pass<00:03:06.200> here<00:03:06.500> hope<00:03:07.490> we<00:03:07.640> draw<00:03:07.820> either<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.240> land<00:03:08.720> or

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
pass here hope we draw either a land or

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.100 
pass here hope we draw either a land or
a<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.470> drop<00:03:09.770> next<00:03:10.070> turn<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:14.420> there's<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.720> second

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
a to drop next turn and there's a second

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.860 
a to drop next turn and there's a second
color<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.670> he's<00:03:19.850> likely<00:03:20.210> to<00:03:20.240> have<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.570> victim

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
color so he's likely to have the victim

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.540 
color so he's likely to have the victim
of<00:03:20.930> nights<00:03:21.080> we<00:03:21.230> were<00:03:21.320> passing<00:03:21.530> although<00:03:22.370> these

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
of nights we were passing although these

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.070 
of nights we were passing although these
fiends<00:03:22.880> have<00:03:22.940> been<00:03:23.060> going<00:03:23.270> pretty<00:03:23.420> late<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:23.960> I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
fiends have been going pretty late so I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.199 
fiends have been going pretty late so I
guess<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:25.040> could<00:03:25.220> be<00:03:25.250> pretty<00:03:25.610> much<00:03:25.880> anywhere

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
guess it could be pretty much anywhere

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:35.500 
guess it could be pretty much anywhere
in<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.390> draft<00:03:32.020> hmm<00:03:33.020> just<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.800> moment<00:03:33.920> here<00:03:34.510> well

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
in the draft hmm just a moment here well

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.790 
in the draft hmm just a moment here well
I'm<00:03:35.780> not<00:03:35.900> going<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.080> say<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.320> that's<00:03:36.500> fine

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
I'm not going to say that that's fine

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.160 
I'm not going to say that that's fine
but<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.640> guess<00:03:40.420> he's<00:03:41.420> going<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.750> get<00:03:41.840> in<00:03:41.989> for

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
but I guess he's going to get in for

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.830 
but I guess he's going to get in for
four<00:03:43.060> hopefully<00:03:44.060> we<00:03:44.180> just<00:03:44.209> draw<00:03:44.480> our<00:03:44.630> land

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
four hopefully we just draw our land

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.890 
four hopefully we just draw our land
next<00:03:45.080> turn<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:46.820> could<00:03:47.270> get<00:03:47.510> out<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.660> hand

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
next turn that could get out of hand

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.240 
next turn that could get out of hand
depending<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:48.650> his<00:03:48.739> hand<00:03:48.920> is

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.580 

well<00:03:55.880> that's<00:03:56.150> something<00:03:56.300> at<00:03:56.510> least<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:57.290> let's

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
well that's something at least so let's

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.440 
well that's something at least so let's
go<00:03:57.680> ahead<00:03:57.710> and<00:03:57.860> bash<00:03:58.070> for<00:03:58.340> two<00:03:58.550> again<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.090> feel

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
go ahead and bash for two again I feel

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.670 
go ahead and bash for two again I feel
like<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.660> are<00:03:59.780> still<00:04:00.050> racing<00:04:00.470> him<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:03.140> then

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
like we are still racing him and then

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.400 
like we are still racing him and then
we'll<00:04:03.800> just<00:04:03.920> play<00:04:04.100> our<00:04:04.400> 45<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:05.780> passed<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
we'll just play our 45 and passed the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.060 
we'll just play our 45 and passed the
turn<00:04:10.030> hopefully<00:04:11.030> he<00:04:11.330> doesn't<00:04:11.920> like<00:04:12.920> play

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
turn hopefully he doesn't like play

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.380 
turn hopefully he doesn't like play
cross<00:04:13.340> way<00:04:13.520> vampires<00:04:13.700> or<00:04:14.150> something<00:04:14.330> like

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
cross way vampires or something like

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.380 
cross way vampires or something like
that<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.630> could<00:04:15.020> get<00:04:15.110> out<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.260> hand<00:04:16.120> we<00:04:17.120> might

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
that that could get out of hand we might

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.120 
that that could get out of hand we might
still<00:04:17.600> be<00:04:17.660> able<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.930> race<00:04:18.170> that<00:04:18.440> but<00:04:18.920> it's

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
still be able to race that but it's

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.040 
still be able to race that but it's
going<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> lot<00:04:19.700> harder<00:04:23.050> although

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
going to be a lot harder although

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.570 
going to be a lot harder although
stealing<00:04:24.470> our<00:04:24.530> guy<00:04:24.740> would<00:04:24.950> be<00:04:25.070> pretty<00:04:25.250> bad<00:04:25.400> to

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
stealing our guy would be pretty bad to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.340 
stealing our guy would be pretty bad to
V<00:04:25.790> as<00:04:25.880> traders<00:04:26.210> instinct<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:29.480> hits<00:04:29.900> us<00:04:30.020> for

V as traders instinct that hits us for

V as traders instinct that hits us for
quite<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.890> bit

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.900 

hmm<00:04:40.620> our<00:04:41.620> draw<00:04:41.890> has<00:04:42.070> been<00:04:42.220> pretty<00:04:42.490> bad<00:04:42.640> this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
hmm our draw has been pretty bad this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.610 
hmm our draw has been pretty bad this
game<00:04:43.150> all<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.840> way<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.990> get<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.170> Manor<00:04:44.410> to

game all the way to get the Manor to

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
play the scavenger certainly hasn't been

play the scavenger certainly hasn't been
grade<00:04:48.390> no<00:04:49.390> attacks<00:04:49.720> good<00:04:49.960> for<00:04:50.140> us<00:04:50.260> though<00:04:53.400> all

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
grade no attacks good for us though all

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.620 
grade no attacks good for us though all
right<00:04:54.520> well<00:04:54.760> let's<00:04:55.000> go<00:04:55.090> ahead<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.270> travel

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
right well let's go ahead and travel

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:14.470 
right well let's go ahead and travel
crowd<00:05:00.210> do<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.330> again<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:05.380> let's<00:05:05.740> attack

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.090 

that<00:05:15.080> is<00:05:15.260> fine

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100
