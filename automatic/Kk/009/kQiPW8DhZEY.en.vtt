 Hi there, cutting a chicken with a knife Becker 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.620
 titan i start testing this knife 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.130
 because I am very interested to check 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:21.720
 how behaves by Kirovsk 447 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:23.600
 and let's start with such a principle 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.840
 most serious test 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.329
 but as we have seen in some cases 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.579
 he can reveal very specifically 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.579
 deficiencies if they are present 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.300
 now just remembered that I forgot 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.580
 show sharpening before the start 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:21.670
 test in principle for. factory pretty 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.670
 rough but flawless 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.920
 ran out of battery in the middle of a test like 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.110
 once the moment i wanted to say 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.619
 what is in this work after 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.920
 ergonomics is not the most convenient knife he 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.830
 very thin will need to be comfortable to wear 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:07.869
 but when you need to push 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:10.110
 somehow somehow it is not unusual 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.110
 arms 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.019
 I do not know what exactly the problem is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:31.480
 In principle, his form is very nice 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:31.480
 without some exotic elements and 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:49.790
 final cutting test 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:55.180
 small bones all now let's 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.180
 wash the knife and see a new point 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.469
 [music] 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.100
 In principle, I think very well for 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.670
 . absolutely not changed right here right here on 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.880
 the tip and see it cuts weaker but the tip 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.890
 was initially badly sharpened and finally a 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.780
 I did not do anything with a tip that is 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.290
 the main work was done here 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:13.950
 the middle of the cutting edge as i can 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:15.320
 see everything remained unchanged for 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 cardboard test 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.030
 if we get to beria test i 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.660
 Of course I will fail this sharpening attack 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.760
 It may be quite a transfer knife if 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:35.820
 there will be some problems here I can 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:39.870
 say that bio Kirov 447 turned 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.860
 good, no problems , thank you 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.540
 for watching 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.540
 bye bye
