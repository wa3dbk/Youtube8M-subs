just in the space underneath the pack

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.630 
just in the space underneath the pack
itself<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.650> found<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.489> bit

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
itself but I found that it's it's a bit

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.030 
itself but I found that it's it's a bit
low<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.299> found<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.410> when<00:03:01.590> you're<00:03:01.739> trying<00:03:01.890> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
low I found that when you're trying to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.580 
low I found that when you're trying to
sit<00:03:02.220> down<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.640> maybe<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> rock<00:03:03.269> scramble<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
sit down and maybe do a rock scramble it

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.130 
sit down and maybe do a rock scramble it
gets<00:03:04.860> caught<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.310> things<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.959> some<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.080> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
gets caught on things and some of the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.270 
gets caught on things and some of the
evidence<00:03:07.640> speaks<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.790> itself<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.920> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
evidence speaks for itself so this is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.360 
evidence speaks for itself so this is

but this is being the pack that I've
used<00:03:52.500> extensively<00:03:53.310> over<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.850> past<00:03:54.090> four

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
used extensively over the past four

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.090 
used extensively over the past four
years<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.690> I'll<00:03:55.079> probably<00:03:55.290> still<00:03:55.680> continue

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
years and I'll probably still continue

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.759

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
to use it taking my family out and

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.519 
to use it taking my family out and
enjoying<00:03:58.769> great<00:03:59.130> outdoors
