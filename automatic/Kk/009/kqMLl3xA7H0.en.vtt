00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
new ones you buy nowadays are going to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.530

be electronic ballast the ballast is
going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.900> probably<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.410> same<00:01:01.800> length<00:01:02.130> but

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
going to be probably the same length but

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.380 
going to be probably the same length but
a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.820> skinnier<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.290> quite<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.739> deep<00:01:05.390> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a lot skinnier and not quite as deep and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
a lot skinnier and not quite as deep and
they're<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.170> simple<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> change

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they're really really simple to change

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.349 
they're really really simple to change
out<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> few<00:01:09.719> basic<00:01:09.960> tools

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
out you just need a few basic tools

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.429 
out you just need a few basic tools
depending<00:01:12.359> on<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> fixture<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> you're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
depending on the fixture that you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.059 
depending on the fixture that you're
working<00:01:13.649> on<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.740> I've<00:01:16.829> already

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
working on this one here I've already

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
always has with any electrical work you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.319 
always has with any electrical work you
want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.219> make<00:01:44.280> sure<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.729> your<00:01:44.969> powers

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
want to make sure that your powers

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.459 
want to make sure that your powers
turned<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.139> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.069> rather<00:01:47.759> simple

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
turned off and this is a rather simple

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.580 
turned off and this is a rather simple
yet<00:01:49.469> inexpensive<00:01:50.369> tool<00:01:50.639> it<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.590> voltage

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
yet inexpensive tool it is a voltage

alert<00:01:53.249> tester<00:01:54.889> believe<00:01:55.889> this<00:01:56.069> one<00:01:56.249> here<00:01:56.459> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
alert tester believe this one here this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.309 
alert tester believe this one here this
is<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> fluke<00:01:57.509> brand<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.350> cost<00:01:58.829> less<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.310> $20

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
is a fluke brand that cost less than $20

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.300 
is a fluke brand that cost less than $20
and<00:02:01.319> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.679> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.099> them<00:02:02.219> even

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and I think you can get them even

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.989 
and I think you can get them even
cheaper<00:02:02.849> than<00:02:02.999> that<00:02:03.209> but<00:02:04.170> uh<00:02:04.789> this<00:02:05.789> one<00:02:05.969> here

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
cheaper than that but uh this one here

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.029 
cheaper than that but uh this one here
particular<00:02:06.749> model<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.380> little<00:02:07.649> button<00:02:07.950> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
particular model has a little button on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.510 
particular model has a little button on
top<00:02:08.250> turn<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.560> as<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
top turn it on and as you can see it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.470 
top turn it on and as you can see it
blinks<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:13.140> listen<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.740> song<00:02:14.010> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
blinks just to listen to that song and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.440 
blinks just to listen to that song and
when<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.600> put<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> power<00:02:16.470> source

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
when you put it to a power source

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.190 
when you put it to a power source
it<00:02:19.450> glows<00:02:19.840> red<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.590> these<00:02:21.550> other<00:02:22.510> models<00:02:22.870> may

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
it glows red and these other models may

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.800 
it glows red and these other models may
be<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.590> little<00:02:24.070> bit<00:02:24.250> different<00:02:24.460> things<00:02:24.850> most<00:02:25.600> of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
be a little bit different things most of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.850 
be a little bit different things most of
them<00:02:25.900> should<00:02:26.140> beep

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
them should beep

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.960 
them should beep

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
just go ahead and turn the breaker off

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.520 
just go ahead and turn the breaker off
because<00:02:52.270> somebody<00:02:52.660> comes<00:02:52.960> along<00:02:53.230> when<00:02:53.410> you're

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
because somebody comes along when you're

because somebody comes along when you're
working<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.370> turns<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.180> switch<00:02:55.390> on

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.009 
just gonna take and cut after you turn
your<00:03:38.920> power<00:03:39.040> off<00:03:39.360> you'll<00:03:40.360> cut<00:03:40.630> your<00:03:40.810> wires

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
your power off you'll cut your wires

your power off you'll cut your wires
back<00:03:42.090> fairly<00:03:43.090> close<00:03:44.070> like<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.959> got

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
back fairly close like this so you got

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.110 
back fairly close like this so you got
plenty<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.500> slack<00:03:47.860> for<00:03:48.430> when<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.670> replace

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120

that thing and if I read it here I think
it's<00:04:55.160> like<00:04:55.310> 18<00:04:55.730> gauge<00:04:55.970> wire<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:57.020> it's<00:04:57.140> solid

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
it's like 18 gauge wire and it's solid

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.080 
it's like 18 gauge wire and it's solid
so<00:04:59.650> it's<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.860> balance<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.490> follow<00:05:01.700> your<00:05:01.910> wires

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
so it's a balance to follow your wires

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.090 
so it's a balance to follow your wires
match<00:05:02.480> up<00:05:02.720> same<00:05:02.990> color<00:05:03.260> just<00:05:03.560> simple<00:05:03.830> twist

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
match up same color just simple twist

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.900 
match up same color just simple twist
them<00:05:04.250> back<00:05:04.430> together<00:05:04.640> it's<00:05:05.060> easy<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:06.020> if<00:05:06.910> it's

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
them back together it's easy and if it's

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.060 
them back together it's easy and if it's
a<00:05:08.030> difference<00:05:08.480> if<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:08.960> had<00:05:09.140> electronic<00:05:09.710> ballast

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
a difference if I had electronic ballast

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.650 
a difference if I had electronic ballast
and<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.460> was<00:05:10.580> different<00:05:10.820> I<00:05:11.030> could<00:05:11.090> show<00:05:11.630> you

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
and it was different I could show you

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.560 
and it was different I could show you
and<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.830> probably<00:05:13.040> will<00:05:13.340> do<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.700> because<00:05:13.850> this

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
and I probably will do that because this

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:33.060 
and I probably will do that because this
particular<00:05:14.810> fixture<00:05:15.620> right<00:05:15.650> here<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.300> a

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.010 

anyway<00:05:34.660> as<00:05:35.660> you<00:05:35.840> can<00:05:35.990> see<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:38.090> can<00:05:38.210> see<00:05:38.450> these

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
anyway as you can see you can see these

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.650 
anyway as you can see you can see these
bulbs<00:05:39.440> that<00:05:39.590> are<00:05:39.800> lit<00:05:40.010> are<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:40.940> lot<00:05:41.180> skinnier

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
bulbs that are lit are a lot skinnier

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.390 
bulbs that are lit are a lot skinnier
that's<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.470> difference<00:05:42.770> -<00:05:42.950> I<00:05:42.980> need<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.280> tell

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
that's the difference - I need to tell

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.670 
that's the difference - I need to tell
you<00:05:43.520> about<00:05:43.640> these<00:05:44.510> here<00:05:44.780> are<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.050> new<00:05:45.230> t8

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
you about these here are the new t8

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.850 
you about these here are the new t8
lamps<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.900> they're<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.930> lot<00:05:48.080> smaller<00:05:48.440> they're

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
lamps and they're a lot smaller they're

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.950 
lamps and they're a lot smaller they're
actually<00:05:49.430> better<00:05:49.910> because<00:05:50.090> they're<00:05:50.570> more

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
actually better because they're more

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.530 
actually better because they're more
efficient<00:05:51.560> it's<00:05:51.740> like<00:05:51.920> these<00:05:52.160> new<00:05:52.540> curlicue

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
efficient it's like these new curlicue

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.120 
efficient it's like these new curlicue
light<00:05:53.930> bulbs<00:05:54.290> you<00:05:54.410> can<00:05:54.440> buy<00:05:54.740> for<00:05:55.100> your

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
light bulbs you can buy for your

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.650 
light bulbs you can buy for your
incandescent<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:56.030> replace<00:05:56.360> them<00:05:56.510> with<00:05:56.600> a

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
incandescent to replace them with a

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.890 
incandescent to replace them with a
fluorescent<00:05:57.310> much<00:05:58.310> better<00:05:58.670> on<00:05:58.910> energy<00:06:00.190> but

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
fluorescent much better on energy but

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.870 
fluorescent much better on energy but
I'll<00:06:02.900> show<00:06:03.260> you<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.740> another<00:06:03.770> video<00:06:04.520> here

I'll show you on another video here
there<00:06:05.390> we<00:06:05.540> go<00:06:06.280> I'll<00:06:07.280> show<00:06:07.520> you<00:06:07.580> on<00:06:07.910> another

there we go I'll show you on another

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.620 
there we go I'll show you on another
video

um<00:06:09.550> what<00:06:10.550> you<00:06:10.700> got<00:06:10.850> to<00:06:10.970> do<00:06:11.060> to<00:06:11.270> replace<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.020> put

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
um what you got to do to replace and put

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.700 
um what you got to do to replace and put
in<00:06:12.320> a<00:06:13.450> electronic<00:06:14.450> when<00:06:14.900> you're<00:06:15.050> replacing<00:06:15.560> it

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
in a electronic when you're replacing it

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.060 
in a electronic when you're replacing it
with<00:06:16.670> about<00:06:16.970> oh<00:06:17.180> uh<00:06:17.410> what<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.500> fixture<00:06:18.920> that

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
with about oh uh what the fixture that

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.260 
with about oh uh what the fixture that
had<00:06:19.370> a<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:21.460> t12<00:06:22.460> init's<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.000> old<00:06:23.150> Maoist<00:06:23.800> so

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
had a a t12 init's the old Maoist so

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.460 
had a a t12 init's the old Maoist so
hopefully<00:06:26.270> that<00:06:26.480> gives<00:06:26.510> you<00:06:26.780> a<00:06:26.870> little<00:06:27.110> bit<00:06:27.350> of

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
hopefully that gives you a little bit of

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.320 
hopefully that gives you a little bit of
a<00:06:27.940> insight<00:06:28.940> there<00:06:29.240> and<00:06:30.820> keep<00:06:31.820> watching<00:06:32.240> my

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
a insight there and keep watching my

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.080 
a insight there and keep watching my
channel<00:06:32.780> I'm<00:06:32.900> on<00:06:33.110> probably<00:06:33.790> since<00:06:34.790> I<00:06:34.910> got<00:06:35.030> a

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
channel I'm on probably since I got a

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.830 
channel I'm on probably since I got a
lot<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.419> time

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
lot of time

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.830 
lot of time
I<00:06:35.870> got<00:06:36.740> laid<00:06:36.980> off<00:06:37.360> probably<00:06:38.360> been<00:06:38.600> doing<00:06:38.780> a

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
I got laid off probably been doing a

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.930 
I got laid off probably been doing a
bunch<00:06:39.050> more<00:06:39.139> how-to<00:06:39.560> on<00:06:40.040> electrical<00:06:40.610> videos

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
bunch more how-to on electrical videos

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.889 
bunch more how-to on electrical videos
so<00:06:41.240> uh<00:06:41.320> thanks<00:06:42.320> for<00:06:42.350> watching
