00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:10.670
 to see different for all x reason 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.410
 Welcome to the channel and welcome to a 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.840
 new weekly news in this case 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.960
 the number 99 submits that a week 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.519
 for the 100-week special that already 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.220
 it will occur to me on the wall is that not yet 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.859
 thought nothing so special but something I'll do 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.329
 I imagine that of course black 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.579
 He deserves it more than anything for putting up with me 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.720
 during these 100 weeks as man 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.699
 it deserves something unless I make a 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.230
 special and finally as for the week 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.460
 what concerns us is the same 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.810
 been quite quiet there have been 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.730
 many details there have not been many 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.770
 news in January in general 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.990
 it's being pretty quiet 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.520
 say that too quiet but good 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.840
 even so you already know that you have in the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.120
 description the information that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.680
 you need about the video games that 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.030
 the trailers appear on the screen and everything 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.010
 the usual and little more to say if 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.390
 you want more information and more news or 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.130
 content this guy does not distance a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.080
 look at my channel said this we go 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.400
 directly with the news of this 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.960
 week first of all we started 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.490
 talking about a short story but that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.720
 I consider it quite interesting 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.729
 especially for all those who 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.640
 You are fans of the Star Wars saga and it's 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.890
 that many 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.260
 you will remember with great expectation a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.870
 title that was announced to us in March 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.550
 last year called star wars 1.313 that 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.860
 was supposed to put us in the 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.680
 booby fetch bounty hunter 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 of course it allowed a lot and when 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.100
 we learned that the study that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.470
 I was developing closed in this case 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 Lucasarts of course it was a bitch 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.310
 like who says but good and many 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 you will remember that the company disney 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 disney if he got the rights of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 lucasarts and that much of the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 videogames that was developing that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 company became licenses for 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 disney so far many of us had 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.300
 Hope and faith that disney 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 continue to develop that videogame 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.830
 but finally in an official statement 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.570
 has said that the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.920
 license that they will not renew the and that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.380
 they will not continue working on that 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 project painted quite well a shame 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.009
 simply because I wanted to tell you that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.950
 finally definitively 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.869
 cancels the development of star wars 1.313 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.009
 It's a shame that we look good 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.660
 talking about a video game the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.880
 legendary neither more nor less than tetris 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.380
 many of you maybe I would have 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.090
 come to play but I imagine that at 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.500
 unless you have heard about it and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.100
 surely if you ask your 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.050
 parents 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.390
 sure they will have played but one in 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130
 this case the ubisoft company seems to be 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.900
 that has certain licenses to certain 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.730
 rights over that mark over that of 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.940
 tetris well he has made a kind 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.290
 of contract so to speak with the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.420
 contract agreement or rather with 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.580
 microsoft and with sonny by which to 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.530
 approximately mid-beginning 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.820
 this year it's supposed to come that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.130
 downloadable format title for 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.380
 playstation 4 and xbox one your news a 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.330
 little curious but she has called me quite 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.680
 the attention and I think that good hey no 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 we know how much will be worth but of course 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 that it can be quite interesting to have 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.100
 in our consoles next 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.580
 tetris generation I do not know I suppose will be 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.870
 same 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.700
 of addictive that it was at the time 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.320
 let's keep talking about other news that 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.940
 possibly you will be interested a little bit 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.380
 more than the tetris in this case has 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.990
 what to do with the video game of call of 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 duty and its first dlc called console that 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.500
 finally has a release date 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 scheduled for January 28 for 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.820
 xbox band and xbox 360 later 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.470
 we still do not know when it will go out so much for 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.730
 playstation 3 as principle 4 as 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.260
 computer at least is what has 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.670
 insured there's still no date so 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.200
 you have to be aware but good here 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.980
 you have on the screen is the official trailer 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.260
 of this dlc 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 will bring four multiplayer maps a map 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.150
 also in the extinction mode and also a 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.440
 weapon that will become both 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.780
 different weapons in both a rifle 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.159
 assault with a precision rifle according to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.110
 we choose something pretty 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.849
 completito and quite interesting and what 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.440
 most striking about everything is the fact 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.030
 that there will be different missions of 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.730
 field I do not know if that would be the translation 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.500
 exactly what we could do from the element 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.629
 in question but my different missions 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.950
 of field that will appear in these new 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.200
 multiplayer maps that when the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.299
 complete we will give a reward 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.940
 quite curious the most striking by 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.190
 Example is the map in this case we 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.989
 will turn michael myers a character of 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.400
 fiction of some horror movies of 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.750
 a lot of years ago those who 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.250
 they were young you will not recognize them but 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.959
 Of course the interesting thing is that we 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.879
 will put in the skin of a murderer who will go 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.799
 with an ax in his hand but killing 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.569
 directly with the ax to our 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.069
 enemies in a multiplayer map yes as 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.379
 Of course it is quite 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.480
 impressive and the less it sounds 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.310
 attractive but a part of that too 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.959
 on the other maps both the baby 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.430
 containment and ingenuity that are the 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.739
 names of the other three maps 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.209
 there will be different field missions or 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.340
 for example a kind 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.889
 of mortar attack also has to 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.050
 with radioactivity a little bit of what 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.430
 offer the mapping without a doubt the 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.520
 most striking is the one of how I said 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.610
 this trailer comes out to concentrate this tlc 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.830
 forgiveness goes on sale for xbox 360 the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.849
 January 28 and talking from the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.289
 stool we also have to continue 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.090
 Now giving a little bit about the 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.949
 video game the last of us called the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.690
 strip and jaén that finally has a date 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.220
 planned release in this case for 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.560
 on February 14 , day of the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.660
 in love what nice so good in this 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.849
 case this dlc will put us in the skin of 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.199
 he and the siat as protagonist of the 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.090
 video game as such but that in this 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.370
 case will take the role of protagonist 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.650
 directly and a new one will be added 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.630
 partner or companion forgiveness call 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.610
 rail and she's supposed to be a friend of 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.699
 childhood and in fact they will tell us the 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.470
 own dlc the content by the 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.970
 argument that takes place before what 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.470
 happened in the video game from the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.270
 glasses so if you loved the 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.099
 original video game so do not hesitate in 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.259
 take a look at this dlc that as 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.970
 I said it leaves on February 14 for 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.620
 obviously precision three points which is 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.259
 exclusive to this platform and already 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.120
 last to finish this week so 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.630
 shit I do not know how to say it but since 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.490
 then 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.020
 it has been quite disappointing has not 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.700
 there was hardly content then that less 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.110
 which also refers to a 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.880
 video game that takes care of us a bit by 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.220
 surprise that is announced is about 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.010
 new title of rambo the first title 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.230
 So great that they are going to do about this 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.880
 movie that is supposed to become 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.290
 in video game as you see on the screen is 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.820
 a shooter but in this case it's not a 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.160
 shooter in which we control our 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.110
 character and we do not move around but 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.180
 that will be a shooter on rails is 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.550
 say we are moving and we 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.680
 we aim for the screen to kill 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.580
 enemies something like crazy for me 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.320
 seems to call me the 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.390
 videogames I do not remember exactly but 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.860
 good a genre that is not currently 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.449
 in its greatest splendor but who 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.580
 tastes good to like and not the same 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.960
 it seems as bad as how it really goes 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.249
 be who knows at the moment there is no date 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.870
 of launch that is supposed to come out 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.699
 early middle of this year 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.219
 Thank you so much for playstation 3 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.870
 xbox 360 and computer 10 end up here 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.979

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.199
 done at the beginning has been a week 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.729
 pretty bad enough there has not been 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.199
 There has been a lot of content 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.460
 but good good yes I hope that I have 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.360
 you already know that if you want more 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.710
 news or more content similar to what 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.689
 that you just saw so you do not want to throw 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.039
 a look at my channel and little more than 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.419
