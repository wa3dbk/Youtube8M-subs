way they balance the center of gravity

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
way they balance the center of gravity
is<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.579> distributes<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.240> weight<00:01:39.270> evenly

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810

on your head it almost feels too too

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330 
on your head it almost feels too too
light<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.360> dramatically<00:01:49.200> notice<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.890> half

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
light you dramatically notice that half

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.310 
light you dramatically notice that half
a<00:01:50.460> pound<00:01:50.640> difference<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.630> let's<00:01:51.810> talk<00:01:51.990> about

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a pound difference now let's talk about

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.410 
a pound difference now let's talk about
the<00:01:52.860> difference<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> carbon<00:01:53.880> fiber<00:01:54.119> here

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the difference in the carbon fiber here

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
the difference in the carbon fiber here
completely<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.259> stands<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.770> why<00:01:56.219> it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
completely as it stands and why it's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
completely as it stands and why it's
taken<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:56.939> long<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.420> us<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> full

of the competitors helmets they're using

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
of the competitors helmets they're using
still<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> composite<00:02:07.710> carbon<00:02:08.039> fiber<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
still a composite carbon fiber so

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.219 
still a composite carbon fiber so
they're<00:02:08.580> using<00:02:08.729> other<00:02:09.000> materials<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.959> layers

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
they're using other materials the layers

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.780 
they're using other materials the layers
of<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> helmet<00:02:10.770> might<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.039> an<00:02:11.160> outer<00:02:11.340> layer<00:02:11.580> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
of the helmet might be an outer layer of

of the helmet might be an outer layer of
carbon<00:02:12.000> fiber<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.750> might<00:02:12.930> see

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.899 
carbon fiber you might see
fiber<00:02:13.530> glass<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.099> there<00:02:14.370> might<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.730> be

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
fiber glass in there there might see be

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.119 
fiber glass in there there might see be
some<00:02:15.090> Dyneema<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> reason<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
some Dyneema and really the reason is is

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.130 
some Dyneema and really the reason is is
that<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.700> accent<00:02:18.269> style<00:02:18.569> carbon<00:02:18.930> fiber

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
that that accent style carbon fiber

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.309 
that that accent style carbon fiber
which<00:02:19.560> looks<00:02:19.950> great<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.790> really<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.780> little<00:02:22.200> bit

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
which looks great is really a little bit

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.470 
which looks great is really a little bit
it's<00:02:22.739> actually<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.190> lot<00:02:23.519> too<00:02:23.849> brittle<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.360> be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it's actually a lot too brittle to be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
it's actually a lot too brittle to be
used<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.290> full<00:02:25.500> construction<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.129> the

allows us to see this race car band hit
the<00:02:31.440> market<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.610> really<00:02:32.849> stemmed

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the market is that it really stemmed

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.470 
the market is that it really stemmed
from<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.450> Formula<00:02:33.840> One<00:02:33.870> program<00:02:34.410> our<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
from the Formula One program our I

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.750 
from the Formula One program our I
discovered<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.629> methodology<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.709> use<00:02:38.220> carbon

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
discovered a methodology to use carbon

the guts the inner shell is carbon fiber
as<00:02:47.610> well<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> what<00:02:48.180> they've<00:02:48.299> allowed<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.720> to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
as well and what they've allowed it to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.020 
as well and what they've allowed it to
do<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.290> they've<00:02:49.799> developed<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.340> methodology

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
do is they've developed a methodology

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.729 
do is they've developed a methodology
using<00:02:51.299> this<00:02:51.540> 90<00:02:51.870> degree<00:02:52.140> weave<00:02:52.349> which

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
using this 90 degree weave which

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.559 
using this 90 degree weave which
actually<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.819> go<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.450> layers

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
actually as you go down and layers

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.849 
actually as you go down and layers
there's<00:02:54.780> multiple<00:02:55.200> layers<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.470> carbon<00:02:55.739> fiber

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
there's multiple layers of carbon fiber

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.780 
there's multiple layers of carbon fiber
it<00:02:56.430> will<00:02:56.489> actually<00:02:57.150> change<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:58.079> strength<00:02:58.349> but

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
it will actually change for strength but

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.309 
it will actually change for strength but
flexibility<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.030> key<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.989> they<00:03:01.109> had

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
flexibility is the key here so they had

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.110 
flexibility is the key here so they had
to<00:03:01.440> develop<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.920> carbon<00:03:02.250> fiber<00:03:02.459> methodology

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to develop a carbon fiber methodology

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.059 
to develop a carbon fiber methodology
