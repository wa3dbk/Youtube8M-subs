Expo for AT&amp;T Wireless this phone is
making<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.299> lot<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.570> noise<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.260> two<00:00:16.410> reasons

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
making a lot of noise for two reasons

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.220 
making a lot of noise for two reasons
the<00:00:17.070> first<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> few<00:00:18.840> care

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the first it's one of the few care

snapdragon<00:00:21.990> 1<00:00:22.260> gigahertz<00:00:22.740> processor<00:00:23.060> which

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor which

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.929 
snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor which
is<00:00:24.269> crazy<00:00:24.750> fast<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.830> comparison<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.609> iPhone

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
is crazy fast by comparison the iPhone

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.200 
is crazy fast by comparison the iPhone
3GS<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.869> example<00:00:28.289> has<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.130> 600<00:00:29.939> gigahertz

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
3GS for example has a 600 gigahertz

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
3GS for example has a 600 gigahertz
processor<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.349> market<00:00:31.830> ibly<00:00:32.009> quicker

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
processor so this is market ibly quicker

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
processor so this is market ibly quicker
I'll<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.510> translates<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> actual

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
I'll see how that translates to actual

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.600 
I'll see how that translates to actual
real-world<00:00:35.390> speed<00:00:36.390> improvements<00:00:36.989> or

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
real-world speed improvements or

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
real-world speed improvements or
multitasking<00:00:38.610> abilities<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.750> second<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
multitasking abilities the second is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
multitasking abilities the second is

I<00:01:35.280> believe<00:01:35.369> assisted<00:01:36.000> GPS<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.600> it'll<00:01:36.810> use<00:01:36.960> cell

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
Snapdragon processor so I'm really

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.430 
Snapdragon processor so I'm really
curious<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.670> how<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.000> works<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.450> same<00:02:26.480> chip

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
curious to how it works the same chip

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.080 
curious to how it works the same chip
that<00:02:27.680> powers<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.960> hd2<00:02:29.960> and<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.980> believe<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.490> Acer

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
that powers the hd2 and I believe a Acer

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.710 
that powers the hd2 and I believe a Acer
phone<00:02:32.330> as<00:02:32.570> well<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.920> go<00:02:34.070> ahead<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.540> take<00:02:35.540> out

here and let's see what sort of standard
this<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:01.040> private<00:03:01.760> area<00:03:02.240> or<00:03:02.390> if

milliamp hours I would assume let's take

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.740 
milliamp hours I would assume let's take
a<00:03:52.489> look<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.330> tells<00:03:53.570> us<00:03:55.570> 1500<00:03:56.570> million

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
a look here if it tells us 1500 million
