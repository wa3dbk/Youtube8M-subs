 Since going out one by one it once you will be a 15 times play 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.060
 Here 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.720
 The mouse's card is a + card 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.210
 Card I want this card 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.530
 A person with a large number of totals wins after all the games are over 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.680
 It means that from agreement 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.660
 23456 This is a mouse card or plus 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.420
 As will Kaoro and 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:02.780
 There is a bad vulture card of the gala This is a card that you do not want with the card 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.230
 There is still 1 to 5 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.230
 today 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.260
 N Day 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.370
 The two flowers mentioned above 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.490
 Let's do a little 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.510
 In the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.260
 With Kumi 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.330
 Motto Moko and I 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.330
 We will continue to develop this vulture 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.500
 Shooting 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.640
 Because the number is large card is wanted card 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 I want to get it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 The curl up to 15 is 1 to 150,000 yen 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.900
 And 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.320
 Big card 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 The 15 cards are the strongest cards. When taking a + card, a big card is 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.430
 Which office of the card Das at any timing because the person who issued it is wins this is 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.280
 You are going to bargain 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.300
 For example 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.180
 Is it a little big 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:07.730
 That 's right I think I want Kore after all the cards of grade 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.210
 And each one thinks which card to play this time 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.210
 Is that okay 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.750
 No 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.020
 And 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.980
 I will open it where the sex is complete 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:27.560
 Please take a look 10 1415 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:31.670
 Because thing because my win was the 15 out to the fact that this card is I get 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.209
 This card will flow from now on 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.209
 However 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.239
 Even when playing the same big card, the meaning changes depending on the way you are 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.239
 Is that okay 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.100
 No 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:57.590
 10 Kumi's is Mr. medium tomoko 15 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.130
 However, my 15 big and strong cards, but the same card comes into play 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.520
 Is that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.940
 It will be a strong card invalid, so not enough Tomoko and I 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.680
 Mr. Kumi will be given this card 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.680
 Such a case, what about the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.710
 You will receive 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.830
 Horror 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:28.070
 Everyone is a strong card, but it is the same card. In this case, this is all disabled and the next chapter 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.070
 Is it 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.980
 No 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:41.680
 I think that tomo 's 14 is cute and flexible 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.970
 Because it is a Kachi, this card will be Yuuka 's 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.490
 Then 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.569
 What happens is the fight when you put a minus of Cars 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.100
 For example, I do not want to 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.440
 But my hand was not born 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.440
 This is the game how it should be in it 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.189
 No 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.840
 Kumi's is the smallest I's your Fujiko is yo in three 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.860
 I have to take this 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.920
 It is not a corner 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.920
 However, there is a rule similar to this one 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.170
 Masu Come 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:30.350
 Yes I have a baby with 3 little pigs but I buy the same one 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:36.320
 The long-awaited because the same card is disabled 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:41.200
 Fu, who issued a such card is why will not we have to taken care of this card 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:46.780
 While doing like this , he is good at bargaining 15 times 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.240
 At the end a lot of cards of this mouse while devising and using weak cards and strong cards 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.370
 His card was raised birds got as low as possible and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.350
 The person who got a lot of total points wins this 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.350
 It is a game called puppet of vulture
