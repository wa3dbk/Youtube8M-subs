00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.700
 Today I wanted a somewhat serious topic 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.980
 address and today together 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:22.470
 looking away is that for one 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.410
 yamaha and in that sense, my name is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 get back to me at least 15 on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 youtube welcome 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 today with a game club on the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.910
 Map shared high tech and a nuclear one 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 sent in by my friend uk subs 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 focus thanks again for this and today in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 I would like to do this video a bit 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.059
 about in november this year 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 appearing call of the dead ones 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.430
 satisfied even if I'm not too 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 I have to be a big call of duty fan 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 honestly admit that I am positive 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.699
 being surprised by what i did 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.430
 so far heard about the game and seen 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.860
 Did he play this game? 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.869
 the first call of duty game that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 First of all exclusively for the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.970
 nextgen that is the ps4 and the xbox 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 was of course in the pc should come out 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.740
 the rest of the game had the rest 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.380
 the game studio already took over 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.659
 on the development of call of duty 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.159
 modern warfare 3 keep what he also 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.680
 not the worst and stronger 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.130
 therefore also with certainty the quality 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.159
 The game is about to discuss the game 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 It is, moreover, within the framework of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.189
 future that means in the year 2000 52 bis 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.670
 of course that will be the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.270
 technology of weapons and so on 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.899
 have developed 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.969
 that's what I also notice on the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.969
 play of the game 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.890
 Furthermore, it should be in the new call 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.360
 of duty mister more gadgets like 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 for example, the so-called exoskeleton 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 a year again time out 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.120
 Skeleton that the player dress 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.160
 with the help of which he can, for example 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.590
 can skip or or or 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.209
 everything runs faster faster 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.709
 that sounds pretty much all right 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.750
 good at 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.610
 and yes, as I said, I'm glad 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.550
 really I am very much 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.890
 curious and hope that the studio feel 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.489
 I also hate something for that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.370
 Names really would not do any good 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.250
 yes as a player such as in 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.160
 have shown call of duty in this 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.220
 All in all, I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.410
 the next call of duty and thank you 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.050

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.530
 infobox will be even more 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.930
 to give information 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.610
 Anyway, I'm out of here now you can 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.390
 look at you 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.340
 hey people you can maybe open 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:11.170
 is always a balancing act 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:13.739
 The club wanted Baumann and many 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.739
