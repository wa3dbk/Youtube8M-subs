00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 good afternoon dear friends with you mr 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.960
 and probably that moment came when I 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 but probably even grown up to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.670
 create your channel on twitch so in 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 principle who wants to watch regular 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 broadcast live broadcasts then actually 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 can subscribe to the channel address of the channel 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.369
 you now see on your screen now 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 I will explain why I created it first 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.140
 Immediately what is the activity channel on u 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.730
 the tube does not slow down that is also 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 videos will come out plus will also 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 videos go out on and jim just besides 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 now add this j 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.070
 regular stream broadcast on twitch 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.719
 because plus these broadcast here 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 fan that can communicate with the subscriber 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.700
 also for example yesterday we did a trial 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.989
 broadcast which looked well of course teaches and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.539
 what is now on my channel there 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 more than 60 thousand followers of it and this 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.050
 I watched the live broadcast yesterday only 60 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 man but also a good number because 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.829
 which is just from the bay-wagon I decided 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.149
 create such a broadcast just watch as 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.340
 everything works played in stranded deep 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.649
 played a game but this cold 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.539
 We played in the play gin just such here 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.500
 games that are not particularly costly pure 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.930
 in order to see how everything will be 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.729
 work and basically I liked that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.290
 what we really talked to subscribers and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.270
 wrote in the comments I'm practically on 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 all the questions answered to all that is real 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 truth code soulful good tube 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 the ether has turned out plus also what else 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.650
 good and twitch what you can stream there 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.780
 in general, absolutely anything for example 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.280
 There is for example a series of such games in which I 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 I want to play but somehow write 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 passing videos for the channel on youtube 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.759
 red somehow a bit of a problem 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.540
 First of all, there won't be much to look at. 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.979
 but there are streams of people 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.360
 live on twitch this first for 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.829
 it doesn't need anything at all 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.110
 video do not fill anything just clicked 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.610
 button on the broadcast of the entire broadcast 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.840
 went that is basically the effort 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 minimum to create 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 such ethers and this being so much easier 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.189
 how to create a live broadcast on u 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.329
 tuba here plus is also possible during 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.759
 stream game to chat with subscribers and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.380
 so even if for example everyone is not particularly 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.850
 interesting this game you play 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.649
 many just go clean so here 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.229
 talk talk and that's why 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.000
 guys basically on all of you to your 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.899
 channel on twitch and inviting plus also 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.759
 now you probably see my group 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.470
 VKontakte because I also advise not 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.270
 give way as there on 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.980
 will post the announcement of what 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.650
 stream will start what i understand 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 do on the canal on y tube I won't every 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.970
 there day or there every week fly there 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.950
 the announcement that here is the type sat down there on this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.230
 week such streams are like this then 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.050
 there will be a type to watch come in that is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.330
 somehow a little stupid just date in 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.250
 ad groups or on your wall in 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.780
 contact is also a link to contact 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.940
 I point out the way I want to sign in B 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.270
 10,000 followers on a page would 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.200
 great, but in principle you can 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.730
 follow all announcements news and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.180
 actually go see here by the way 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 for example today I plan somewhere here 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.110
 start half sixth ether and play there i 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.330
 I do not know to grow or 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.130
 There are many in counter-strike 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.600
 asked to play 1 or global from 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.910
 faces in counter-strike, so somewhere here 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 about half past five wait on the channel 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.810
 will start the broadcast we will play 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.700
 let's talk some fun can become even 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.709
 if we play counter strike and in 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.300
 growth actually talk together with 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.670
 Subscribers will play even quite 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.500
 probably therefore I wait for all 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.570
 again subscribe to the channel on 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.380
 twitch and because now only 64 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.640
 subscriber 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.920
 but this principle is also quite good 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.959
 take into account the fact that the only where I gave 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
 the announcement of the stream here last night I 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.310
 advertised 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.269
 in their own group and that 's why that's all 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.650
 what's waiting for all the guys 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.090
 again youtube channel also 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.390
 will continue to go out 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.620
 videos are different but it will be added 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.140
 on tviche live 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.360
 because again it is much easier 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.100
 organize broadcast play there how 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.140
 still different which I personally want 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.549
 Subscribers want to chat with 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.560
 that's why people are waiting for everyone 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.600
 therefore given meetings with you not say goodbye 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.840
 I hope to see you tonight on the direct 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.840
 I'm on the air for the sixth floor
