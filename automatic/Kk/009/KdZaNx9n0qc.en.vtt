00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
get rid of the ball if you smother them

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.420 
get rid of the ball if you smother them
and<00:01:40.720> keep<00:01:40.869> up<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.200> pressure<00:01:41.409> that's<00:01:42.039> when

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
and keep up the pressure that's when

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.919 
and keep up the pressure that's when
they're<00:01:42.579> going<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.880> turn<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.240> ball<00:01:43.390> over<00:01:43.420> and

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
they're going to turn the ball over and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.219 
they're going to turn the ball over and
may<00:01:44.439> even<00:01:44.470> foul<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.700> get<00:01:45.880> some<00:01:46.090> space<00:01:46.360> just

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
may even foul you to get some space just

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.109 
may even foul you to get some space just
remember<00:01:47.710> not<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.130> reach<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.549> because<00:01:48.939> you're

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
remember not to reach in because you're

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.850 
remember not to reach in because you're
already<00:01:49.270> invading<00:01:49.990> their<00:01:50.140> personal<00:01:50.560> space

already invading their personal space

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.889 
already invading their personal space
and<00:01:51.069> the<00:01:51.520> idea<00:01:51.549> is<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.149> make<00:01:52.329> them<00:01:52.539> hand<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
and the idea is to make them hand the
