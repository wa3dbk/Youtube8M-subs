00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.740 
the idea to grow grapes actually began
as<00:02:08.019> a<00:02:08.049> thesis<00:02:08.619> paper<00:02:08.860> in<00:02:09.130> college<00:02:09.610> as<00:02:09.819> we<00:02:10.450> did<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
as a thesis paper in college as we did a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.360 
as a thesis paper in college as we did a
little<00:02:10.959> research<00:02:11.200> into<00:02:11.440> different<00:02:12.069> varieties

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
little research into different varieties

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.770 
little research into different varieties
of<00:02:12.549> grapes<00:02:12.580> we<00:02:13.000> found<00:02:13.180> 14<00:02:13.450> different

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
of grapes we found 14 different

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.630 
of grapes we found 14 different
varieties<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:15.069> thought<00:02:15.250> could<00:02:15.310> grow

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
varieties that we thought could grow

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.320 
varieties that we thought could grow

strawberry<00:03:03.579> wine<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.060> when<00:03:04.150> we<00:03:04.299> first

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
strawberry wine and when we first

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.360 
strawberry wine and when we first
started<00:03:04.959> we<00:03:05.230> were<00:03:05.530> very<00:03:05.650> small<00:03:06.010> i<00:03:06.040> think<00:03:06.280> our

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
started we were very small i think our

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.069 
started we were very small i think our
very<00:03:06.549> first<00:03:06.820> harvest<00:03:07.090> was<00:03:07.269> about<00:03:07.480> 400<00:03:07.959> pounds

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
very first harvest was about 400 pounds

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.890 
very first harvest was about 400 pounds
of<00:03:08.290> grapes<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:09.489> we<00:03:10.299> thought<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.690> were<00:03:10.780> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
of grapes and so we thought we were the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.180 
of grapes and so we thought we were the
gallows<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.500> time<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.829> so<00:03:11.950> we<00:03:12.069> would

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
gallows at that time and so we would

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.770 
gallows at that time and so we would
make<00:03:12.370> wine<00:03:12.579> out<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.790> anything<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.660> could

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
make wine out of anything that we could

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.020 
make wine out of anything that we could
get<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.109> permit<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:15.220> made<00:03:15.459> anything<00:03:15.760> from

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
get to permit so we made anything from

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.900 
get to permit so we made anything from
apple<00:03:16.510> pear<00:03:17.049> peach<00:03:17.489> anything<00:03:18.489> that's<00:03:18.670> grown

apple pear peach anything that's grown
in<00:03:19.060> Wyoming<00:03:19.600> that's

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
in Wyoming that's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.720 
in Wyoming that's
fruits<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.620> we<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.980> turn<00:03:21.160> into<00:03:21.280> wine<00:03:21.490> we've

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730
