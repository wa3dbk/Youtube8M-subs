 October of the year 1854 in Dublin or Ireland 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.340
 he is considered one of the dramatists 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.250
 most outstanding was a great celebrity 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.679
 of the time due to its sharp and biting 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.140
 ingenuity is remembered throughout the world 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.970
