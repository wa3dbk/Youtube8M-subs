00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
all right so that goes in for a while

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.760 
all right so that goes in for a while
it's<00:02:36.280> intro<00:02:36.700> by<00:02:36.850> likes<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:38.260> after<00:02:38.680> it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it's intro by likes and then after it

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.470 
it's intro by likes and then after it
does<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.280> few<00:02:39.430> times<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.000> goes<00:02:40.150> into<00:02:40.390> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
does that for a few times it goes into a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.140 
does that for a few times it goes into a
part<00:02:40.780> where<00:02:40.960> it's<00:02:41.080> like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.229 

which<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.140> exact<00:02:46.560> same<00:02:46.800> pattern<00:02:47.099> I'm<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
which is the exact same pattern I'm the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.420 
which is the exact same pattern I'm the
exact<00:02:48.510> same<00:02:48.870> pattern<00:02:49.200> only<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.739> lower<00:02:50.040> on

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
exact same pattern only it's lower on

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.839 
exact same pattern only it's lower on
the<00:02:50.790> fret<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.930> um<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.459> Bart

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
the fret and it's um it's a it's Bart

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.030 
the fret and it's um it's a it's Bart
and<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.239> have<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.840> bar<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.290> um<00:02:55.470> top<00:02:55.769> three

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and you have to bar the um top three

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.570 
and you have to bar the um top three
strings

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
strings

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.619 
strings
um<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:58.080> then<00:02:58.379> it's<00:02:58.650> let's<00:02:59.220> see<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.849> um<00:03:00.120> for

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
um and then it's let's see it's um for

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:09.619 
um and then it's let's see it's um for
it<00:03:03.629> goes<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:04.140> seven<00:03:04.560> five<00:03:04.799> four<00:03:08.000> no<00:03:09.000> four

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
it goes for seven five four no four

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.920 
it goes for seven five four no four
seven<00:03:10.110> four<00:03:10.349> five

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.890 

or<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.920> you're<00:03:17.069> doing<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.519> c-sharp<00:03:17.900> it's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
or if you're doing it in c-sharp it's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.729 
or if you're doing it in c-sharp it's
going<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.140> be

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.589 

anyway<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.010> point<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.819> that<00:03:24.269> goes<00:03:24.450> on

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
anyway you the point and that goes on

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.300 
anyway you the point and that goes on
for<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.870> while<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.409> that<00:03:25.650> pretty<00:03:25.860> much<00:03:26.040> good

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
for a while and that pretty much good

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.160 
for a while and that pretty much good
and<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:26.879> after<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.599> just<00:03:27.629> pretty<00:03:28.049> much

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
and then after that you just pretty much

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
and then after that you just pretty much
follow<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.590> rhythm<00:03:28.769> with<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.060> cuz<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.420> do

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
follow the rhythm with it cuz you do

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.690 
follow the rhythm with it cuz you do
muted<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.900> did<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.079> muted<00:03:34.439> on<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.680> fourth<00:03:34.950> fret

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
muted you did a muted on the fourth fret

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.119 
muted you did a muted on the fourth fret
1st<00:03:36.150> strings<00:03:36.780> or<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.109> can<00:03:37.260> do<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.590> mean<00:03:37.980> give

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
1st strings or you can do I mean give

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.710 
1st strings or you can do I mean give
you<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.430> first<00:03:38.640> three<00:03:39.000> strings<00:03:39.269> like

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
you the first three strings like

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.050 
you the first three strings like
normally<00:03:41.569> two<00:03:42.769> or<00:03:43.769> one<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:46.430> sometimes<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.849> one

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
normally two or one I sometimes do one

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.210 
normally two or one I sometimes do one
because<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:48.569> it's<00:03:48.959> easier<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.620> control<00:03:49.920> it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
because it's it's easier to control it

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.399 
because it's it's easier to control it
sometimes<00:03:50.489> sounds<00:03:50.970> smoother<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:52.019> if<00:03:52.290> you

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
sometimes sounds smoother but if you

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.930 
sometimes sounds smoother but if you
want<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.799> more<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:55.250> bigger<00:03:56.250> effect<00:03:56.760> you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
want to have more of a bigger effect you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.470 
want to have more of a bigger effect you
can<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.329> like<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.739> but<00:03:58.879> okay<00:03:59.879> so<00:03:59.940> then<00:04:00.389> you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
can do it like that but okay so then you

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:09.780 
can do it like that but okay so then you
do<00:04:00.599> that<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.079> sort<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.439> like

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.479 

and<00:04:10.790> then<00:04:10.940> in<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.900> while<00:04:12.290> then<00:04:12.560> I'd<00:04:12.920> towards<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
and then in a while then I'd towards the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.550 
and then in a while then I'd towards the
end<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.970> goes<00:04:14.120> like<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:14.660> goes<00:04:15.110> like<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.349> make

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
end it goes like it goes like a make

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.430 
end it goes like it goes like a make
sure<00:04:15.709> it<00:04:15.920> goes<00:04:16.040> like<00:04:16.220> this

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.410 

he's<00:04:23.190> pretty<00:04:23.310> much<00:04:23.430> like<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.760> same<00:04:24.000> pattern

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
he's pretty much like the same pattern

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.420 
he's pretty much like the same pattern
only<00:04:24.750> instead<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.200> doing<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.620> three<00:04:26.190> times

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
only instead of doing it three times

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.800 
only instead of doing it three times
like

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.950 

it<00:04:30.590> goes<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:31.700> goes<00:04:31.850> only<00:04:32.150> halfway<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.810> then

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
it goes it goes only halfway and then

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:45.760 
it goes it goes only halfway and then
Joe's<00:04:33.310> in<00:04:34.310> between<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:34.760> sounds<00:04:34.970> like

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.189 

and<00:04:46.699> then<00:04:46.940> add<00:04:47.060> alright<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.630> then<00:04:47.750> after<00:04:48.080> that

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
and then add alright and then after that

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.170 
and then add alright and then after that
part<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.710> when<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.949> come<00:04:49.130> into<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.550> what<00:04:50.030> I

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
part is when you come into the what I

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.510 
part is when you come into the what I
would<00:04:50.240> call<00:04:50.569> the<00:04:50.720> verse<00:04:51.130> which<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.370> pretty

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
would call the verse which is pretty

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:03.960 
would call the verse which is pretty
much<00:04:52.639> like<00:04:56.020> it's<00:04:57.020> just<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:59.090> four<00:04:59.509> seven

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.240 

you<00:05:04.780> can<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.170> can<00:05:05.350> strum<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.680> however<00:05:06.010> you

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
you can you can strum that however you

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.280 
you can you can strum that however you
want<00:05:06.520> it<00:05:06.790> means<00:05:07.030> as<00:05:07.090> long<00:05:07.240> as<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.540> fits<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:07.960> song

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
want it means as long as it fits in song

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:17.110 
want it means as long as it fits in song
well<00:05:08.320> so<00:05:09.310> that's<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.760> mean<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.120> do<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.450> this

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.590 

so<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.870> do<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.410> that's<00:05:19.770> um<00:05:20.600> the

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
so you can do that and that's um the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:29.720 
so you can do that and that's um the
same<00:05:21.810> thing<00:05:22.080> only<00:05:22.470> it's<00:05:22.830> like

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.340 

you're<00:05:30.730> just<00:05:30.880> gonna<00:05:31.060> beat<00:05:31.330> there<00:05:31.600> in<00:05:32.020> between

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
you're just gonna beat there in between

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.800 
you're just gonna beat there in between
it<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:32.530> that's<00:05:32.830> not<00:05:33.100> that's<00:05:33.430> so<00:05:34.000> far<00:05:34.390> up<00:05:34.570> until

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
it so that's not that's so far up until

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.850 
it so that's not that's so far up until
now<00:05:34.990> it's<00:05:35.620> very<00:05:36.160> very<00:05:36.490> easy<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:38.410> then<00:05:38.710> you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
now it's very very easy and then you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.770 
now it's very very easy and then you
pretty<00:05:39.040> much<00:05:39.130> just<00:05:39.370> do<00:05:39.550> that<00:05:39.760> then<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.360> verses

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
pretty much just do that then the verses

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.660 
pretty much just do that then the verses
and<00:05:40.810> it<00:05:41.080> doesn't<00:05:41.350> really<00:05:41.440> change<00:05:41.560> much<00:05:41.980> until

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
and it doesn't really change much until

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.410 
and it doesn't really change much until
I'd<00:05:43.510> say<00:05:43.810> towards<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.950> ending<00:05:45.520> or<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:46.060> third

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
I'd say towards the ending or the third

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.540 
I'd say towards the ending or the third
quarter<00:05:46.780> of<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.960> song<00:05:47.200> where<00:05:48.040> it<00:05:48.190> goes<00:05:48.340> at

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
quarter of the song where it goes at

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:59.809 
quarter of the song where it goes at
something<00:05:48.790> like<00:05:48.850> this

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.279 

I'm<00:06:00.819> sure<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.120> know<00:06:01.210> if<00:06:01.300> that<00:06:01.389> part<00:06:01.629> is<00:06:01.720> far

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
I'm sure you know if that part is far

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.140 
I'm sure you know if that part is far
guys<00:06:02.530> gonna<00:06:02.710> be<00:06:02.860> just<00:06:03.129> best<00:06:03.400> but<00:06:03.610> you<00:06:03.759> do<00:06:03.910> that

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
guys gonna be just best but you do that

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.529 
guys gonna be just best but you do that
and<00:06:04.479> then<00:06:04.810> on<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:06.069> I<00:06:06.370> think<00:06:06.699> fifth<00:06:06.940> or<00:06:07.150> sixth

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
and then on the I think fifth or sixth

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:08.879 
and then on the I think fifth or sixth
time<00:06:07.569> fourth<00:06:08.110> or<00:06:08.229> fifth<00:06:08.409> something<00:06:08.650> like<00:06:08.740> that

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
time fourth or fifth something like that

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:15.869 
time fourth or fifth something like that
it<00:06:09.250> goes<00:06:09.430> like<00:06:09.580> this

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:25.590 

and<00:06:16.569> then<00:06:16.719> from<00:06:16.990> there<00:06:17.169> on<00:06:17.199> it<00:06:17.529> just<00:06:17.800> goes

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.380 

and<00:06:26.470> is<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:26.740> for<00:06:27.280> a<00:06:27.310> while<00:06:27.580> actually<00:06:28.180> and

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
and is that for a while actually and

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.060 
and is that for a while actually and
then<00:06:28.570> and<00:06:28.840> then<00:06:28.990> it<00:06:29.080> gets<00:06:29.140> really<00:06:29.590> quiet<00:06:29.710> and

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
then and then it gets really quiet and

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.860 
then and then it gets really quiet and
it's<00:06:30.280> only<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.640> guitar<00:06:30.970> and<00:06:31.240> then

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
it's only the guitar and then

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.300 
it's only the guitar and then
immediately<00:06:32.530> after<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:32.830> doing<00:06:32.980> doing<00:06:33.190> that

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
immediately after you doing doing that

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.830 
immediately after you doing doing that
like<00:06:33.490> that's<00:06:33.820> not<00:06:34.180> even<00:06:34.390> a<00:06:34.420> second<00:06:34.720> between

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
like that's not even a second between

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.200 
like that's not even a second between
you<00:06:35.230> can<00:06:35.380> only<00:06:35.500> do<00:06:38.550> which<00:06:39.550> is<00:06:39.700> actually<00:06:39.880> the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
you can only do which is actually the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.000 
you can only do which is actually the
exact<00:06:40.480> same<00:06:40.720> way<00:06:40.900> if<00:06:41.050> it<00:06:41.170> sounds<00:06:41.470> exact<00:06:41.770> same

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
exact same way if it sounds exact same

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.980 
exact same way if it sounds exact same
only<00:06:42.640> you<00:06:43.060> can<00:06:43.300> play<00:06:43.480> it<00:06:43.600> two<00:06:43.690> different<00:06:43.750> ways

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
only you can play it two different ways

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.240 
only you can play it two different ways
which<00:06:44.410> what<00:06:44.620> they're<00:06:44.770> doing

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
which what they're doing

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.480 
which what they're doing
only<00:06:45.730> instead<00:06:45.970> of<00:06:46.060> playing<00:06:46.210> it<00:06:46.300> down<00:06:46.480> here

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
only instead of playing it down here

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.600 
only instead of playing it down here
they're<00:06:48.490> playing<00:06:48.730> it<00:06:48.850> up<00:06:48.910> here<00:06:49.680> so<00:06:50.680> I<00:06:51.010> mean<00:06:51.490> you

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
they're playing it up here so I mean you

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.340 
they're playing it up here so I mean you
can<00:06:51.760> do<00:06:51.820> it<00:06:51.910> either<00:06:52.030> way<00:06:52.150> I<00:06:52.570> just<00:06:53.110> do<00:06:53.320> it

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
can do it either way I just do it

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.130 
can do it either way I just do it
because<00:06:53.590> it's<00:06:53.860> fun<00:06:53.920> but<00:06:54.400> um<00:06:54.580> you<00:06:55.360> do<00:06:55.510> that<00:06:55.750> and

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
because it's fun but um you do that and

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:10.970 
because it's fun but um you do that and
then<00:06:56.320> it's<00:06:56.470> just<00:06:56.620> sort<00:06:56.830> of<00:06:56.890> like

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.040 

and<00:07:11.850> follows<00:07:12.240> that<00:07:12.390> through<00:07:12.720> the<00:07:12.810> end<00:07:12.930> of<00:07:12.960> the

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
and follows that through the end of the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.640 
and follows that through the end of the
song

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.080 

and<00:07:19.650> that's<00:07:19.920> pretty<00:07:20.130> much<00:07:20.310> it<00:07:20.610> that's<00:07:20.640> really

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
and that's pretty much it that's really

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.560 
and that's pretty much it that's really
it<00:07:21.390> there's<00:07:21.690> it's<00:07:22.050> probably<00:07:23.240> probably<00:07:24.240> one<00:07:24.540> of

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.570 
it there's it's probably probably one of

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.540 
it there's it's probably probably one of
their<00:07:24.720> easiest<00:07:25.170> if<00:07:25.350> not<00:07:25.560> the<00:07:25.710> resist<00:07:26.130> song<00:07:26.340> to

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
their easiest if not the resist song to

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.900 
their easiest if not the resist song to
play<00:07:26.790> so<00:07:27.750> it's<00:07:28.680> not<00:07:28.890> very<00:07:29.100> hard<00:07:29.280> to<00:07:29.370> learn<00:07:29.580> if

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
play so it's not very hard to learn if

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.460 
play so it's not very hard to learn if
you<00:07:30.090> didn't<00:07:30.330> understand<00:07:30.750> that<00:07:30.810> well<00:07:31.050> because

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
you didn't understand that well because

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.010 
you didn't understand that well because
I'm<00:07:31.800> a<00:07:31.890> crappy<00:07:32.130> teacher<00:07:32.390> then<00:07:33.390> you<00:07:33.660> could<00:07:33.870> get

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
I'm a crappy teacher then you could get

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.440 
I'm a crappy teacher then you could get
the<00:07:34.110> tabs<00:07:34.380> or<00:07:34.890> the<00:07:35.280> sheet<00:07:35.580> music<00:07:35.730> whatever<00:07:36.330> you

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.450 
the tabs or the sheet music whatever you

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.600 
the tabs or the sheet music whatever you
want<00:07:36.660> but<00:07:37.410> it's<00:07:37.680> not<00:07:38.040> that<00:07:38.250> hard<00:07:38.430> to<00:07:38.520> learn

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610 
want but it's not that hard to learn

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.000 
want but it's not that hard to learn
took<00:07:39.000> me<00:07:39.150> like<00:07:39.330> about<00:07:39.930> half<00:07:40.200> an<00:07:40.350> hour<00:07:40.440> to<00:07:40.830> tell

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.010 
took me like about half an hour to tell

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.030 
took me like about half an hour to tell
you<00:07:41.070> through<00:07:41.310> so<00:07:42.060> it's<00:07:43.020> a<00:07:43.320> good<00:07:43.530> song<00:07:43.770> I

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.040 
you through so it's a good song I

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.800 
you through so it's a good song I

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
recommend learning it especially if

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.710 
recommend learning it especially if
you're<00:07:46.050> a<00:07:46.520> like<00:07:47.520> new<00:07:48.030> beginner<00:07:48.450> or

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 
you're a like new beginner or

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.070 
you're a like new beginner or
intermediate<00:07:48.900> level<00:07:49.680> it's<00:07:50.130> really<00:07:50.310> fun<00:07:50.520> so

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
intermediate level it's really fun so

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.190 
intermediate level it's really fun so
that's<00:07:52.080> about<00:07:52.440> it<00:07:52.590> alright
