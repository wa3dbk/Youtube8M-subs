00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
because as they showed you you spin

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
because as they showed you you spin
right<00:02:11.459> back<00:02:11.730> into<00:02:11.940> defenders<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.569> get

you take a player and you manually

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.870 
you take a player and you manually
control<00:04:19.080> his<00:04:19.260> route<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:20.010> defender<00:04:20.519> does<00:04:20.700> not

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
know what to do and he kind of loosely

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.730 
know what to do and he kind of loosely
mirrors<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.030> because<00:04:24.180> your<00:04:24.660> input<00:04:25.200> comes

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740

anyway but once you do as she says there
it's<00:04:36.120> extremely<00:04:36.600> effective<00:04:37.260> because<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
it's extremely effective because the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.680 
it's extremely effective because the
game<00:04:38.040> doesn't<00:04:38.280> know<00:04:38.460> what<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.640> do<00:04:38.910> anymore<00:04:39.030> it

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
game doesn't know what to do anymore it

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.260 
game doesn't know what to do anymore it

can't make the defensive back cut your
route<00:04:42.540> before<00:04:42.840> your<00:04:43.230> wide<00:04:43.440> receiver<00:04:43.980> does<00:04:44.190> so

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
route before your wide receiver does so

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.850 
route before your wide receiver does so
it<00:04:44.880> gets<00:04:45.030> confused<00:04:45.630> it's<00:04:46.020> doing<00:04:46.470> things<00:04:46.680> it's

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
it gets confused it's doing things it's

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.310 
it gets confused it's doing things it's
not<00:04:47.040> supposed<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:47.970> basically<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:49.110> can

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
not supposed to and basically you can

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.530 
not supposed to and basically you can
turn<00:04:49.470> every<00:04:49.860> play<00:04:50.100> into<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.370> completion<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.480> to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
turn every play into a completion so to

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.430
