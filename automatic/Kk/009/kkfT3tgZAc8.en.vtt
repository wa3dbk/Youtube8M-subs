specific rocket so this review is

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.979 
specific rocket so this review is
primarily<00:00:53.729> based<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.479> rocket<00:00:54.780> itself

horseshoes<00:02:35.209> grenaded<00:02:35.629> horseshoes<00:02:36.019> are<00:02:36.200> very

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
horseshoes grenaded horseshoes are very

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.530 
horseshoes grenaded horseshoes are very
very<00:02:36.890> important<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:37.879> this<00:02:38.060> means<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
very important but this means it's the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.809 
very important but this means it's the
rocket<00:02:39.049> will<00:02:39.560> detonate<00:02:39.769> early<00:02:40.400> based<00:02:40.640> on

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
rocket will detonate early based on

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.569 
rocket will detonate early based on
proximity<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.200> if<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.829> notice<00:02:42.950> stuff<00:02:43.220> blast

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
proximity so if you notice stuff blast

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.250 
proximity so if you notice stuff blast
radius<00:02:43.819> on<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.359> rocket<00:02:44.780> launch<00:02:44.930> right<00:02:45.140> now

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
radius on this rocket launch right now

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.960 
radius on this rocket launch right now
it's<00:02:45.470> almost<00:02:45.859> all<00:02:46.159> it's<00:02:46.340> all<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.670> way<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.819> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
it's almost all it's all the way to the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.789 
it's almost all it's all the way to the
max<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.390> basically<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.049> shoot<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.379> rocket

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
max so basically if I shoot this rocket

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.559 
max so basically if I shoot this rocket
and<00:02:48.980> we're<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:49.909> to<00:02:49.939> go<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.239> testing

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
and we're going to go to the testing

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.180 
and we're going to go to the testing
feel<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.900> should<00:02:51.109> this<00:02:51.230> rocket<00:02:51.620> anywhere

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
feel if I should this rocket anywhere

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.660 
feel if I should this rocket anywhere
near<00:02:52.940> my<00:02:53.269> enemy<00:02:53.690> or<00:02:53.930> anywhere<00:02:54.290> near<00:02:54.739> um<00:02:54.980> you

near my enemy or anywhere near um you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.300 
near my enemy or anywhere near um you
know<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.750> vicinity<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.409> where<00:02:57.709> my<00:02:57.859> enemies<00:02:58.190> at

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
know the vicinity of where my enemies at

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.699 
know the vicinity of where my enemies at
not<00:02:58.579> at<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.879> ice<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.180> enemy<00:02:59.510> itself<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.500> if<00:03:00.620> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
not at the ice on enemy itself but if I

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.500 
not at the ice on enemy itself but if I
shoot<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.159> a<00:03:01.190> wall<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:01.940> enemy<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.299> kind

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
shoot it to a wall and the enemy is kind

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.539 
shoot it to a wall and the enemy is kind
of<00:03:02.569> like<00:03:02.629> hitting<00:03:02.959> behind<00:03:03.079> a<00:03:03.260> wall<00:03:03.470> then<00:03:04.129> based

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
of like hitting behind a wall then based

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.069 
of like hitting behind a wall then based
on<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.879> blast<00:03:05.150> Rangers<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.689> will<00:03:05.750> cause

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
on the blast Rangers it will cause

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.199 
on the blast Rangers it will cause
damage<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.829> enemy<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.310> pretty<00:03:07.670> much<00:03:07.730> kill

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
damage to the enemy and pretty much kill

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.569 
damage to the enemy and pretty much kill
them<00:03:08.409> Italy<00:03:09.409> because<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.920> will<00:03:10.010> detonate<00:03:10.189> as

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
them Italy because it will detonate as

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.759 
them Italy because it will detonate as
soon<00:03:10.819> as<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.180> catches<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:11.629> enemy<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.739> know

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
soon as it catches the enemy you know

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
soon as it catches the enemy you know
when<00:03:13.099> it<00:03:13.220> hits<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.579> wall<00:03:13.790> or<00:03:14.030> before<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.629> even

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
when it hits the wall or before it even

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.319 
when it hits the wall or before it even
hits<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.170> wall<00:03:15.409> so<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.799> very<00:03:16.280> very<00:03:16.639> important

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
hits the wall so a very very important

now we're going to go ahead and test

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.049 
now we're going to go ahead and test
this<00:05:06.709> out<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.099> test<00:05:07.369> the<00:05:07.489> grenadin<00:05:07.879> course

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:08.059 
this out and test the grenadin course

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.669 
this out and test the grenadin course
you<00:05:08.149> to<00:05:08.329> kind<00:05:08.539> of<00:05:08.599> give<00:05:08.719> you<00:05:08.839> an<00:05:08.869> idea<00:05:08.989> of<00:05:09.379> what

you to kind of give you an idea of what

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:11.889 
you to kind of give you an idea of what
exactly<00:05:10.369> does<00:05:10.729> it<00:05:10.789> mean<00:05:10.909> to<00:05:11.089> have<00:05:11.239> any<00:05:11.569> insurer

shoes<00:05:12.199> and<00:05:12.469> so<00:05:12.619> you<00:05:12.709> could<00:05:12.860> also<00:05:13.099> check<00:05:13.429> out

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
shoes and so you could also check out

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.909 
shoes and so you could also check out
the<00:05:13.819> velocity<00:05:13.939> of<00:05:14.449> the<00:05:14.629> rocket<00:05:14.719> launcher<00:05:15.110> so

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
the velocity of the rocket launcher so

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.499
