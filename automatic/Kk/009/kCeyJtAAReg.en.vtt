thing this is a door you may have
encountered<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.449> before<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
encountered it before but you know this

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.769 
encountered it before but you know this
is<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.550> an<00:00:26.789> ordinary<00:00:26.880> door<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.720> not

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
is just an ordinary door it's not

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.830 
is just an ordinary door it's not
particularly<00:00:28.349> enthralling<00:00:29.599> but<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> was

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
particularly enthralling but I was

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
particularly enthralling but I was
thinking<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.529> could<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.040> make<00:00:32.309> these<00:00:32.669> things

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
thinking how could you make these things

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.940 
thinking how could you make these things
you<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> little<00:00:34.110> bit<00:00:34.200> more<00:00:34.350> interesting

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
you know a little bit more interesting

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
you know a little bit more interesting
and<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.700> answer<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and my answer is this thing so this is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.760 
and my answer is this thing so this is
the<00:00:37.739> super<00:00:38.190> awesome<00:00:38.730> amazing<00:00:38.969> door<00:00:39.770> then

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pending but it's pretty simple but it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100 
pending but it's pretty simple but it's
basically<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.640> realistic<00:00:45.450> door<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.960> let's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.100 

alright<00:01:26.220> time<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:27.030> world-famous

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
alright time for my world-famous

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
alright time for my world-famous
thorough<00:01:28.619> explanations<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.790> me<00:01:30.000> well

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
thorough explanations you know me well

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
thorough explanations you know me well
for<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.670> probably<00:01:32.850> guess<00:01:33.030> by

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
for them so as you can probably guess by

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
for them so as you can probably guess by
over<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> recent<00:01:34.290> trend<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.159> videos<00:01:35.430> this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
over the recent trend in my videos this

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
over the recent trend in my videos this
does<00:01:36.060> use<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> resource<00:01:36.780> pack<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.110> that's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
does use a resource pack because that's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
does use a resource pack because that's
apparently<00:01:37.829> no<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.329> does

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
apparently no more thing so this does

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
apparently no more thing so this does
use<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> respect<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.619> tell<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.310> know

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
use a respect but you can tell you know

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.530 
use a respect but you can tell you know
this<00:01:41.640> isn't<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> same

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this isn't actually like the same

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.870 
this isn't actually like the same
texture<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.439> door<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.829> different<00:01:44.340> exactly

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
texture this door is different exactly

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
texture this door is different exactly
you're<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.090> big<00:01:45.240> weighs<00:01:45.420> three<00:01:45.990> blocks<00:01:46.259> er

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you're not big weighs three blocks er

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.249 
you're not big weighs three blocks er
three<00:01:47.369> books<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:48.060> only<00:01:48.240> two<00:01:48.420> blocks<00:01:48.570> high<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
three books is only two blocks high so

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.539 
three books is only two blocks high so
this<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> new<00:01:49.590> resource<00:01:49.890> back<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.159> retexture

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
this is a new resource back I retexture

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.130 
this is a new resource back I retexture
some<00:01:50.700> blocks<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:52.079> quite

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
some blocks and it's actually quite

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.690 
some blocks and it's actually quite
simple

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
simple

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.850 
simple
after<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> resource<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.240> bit<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
after the resource back bit and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.990 
after the resource back bit and

over<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> period<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.620> time<00:02:12.799> and<00:02:13.159> it<00:02:13.430> basically

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
over a period of time and it basically
