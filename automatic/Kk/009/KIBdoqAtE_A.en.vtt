00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.300
 I will 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.150
 Describe the fore grip 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.420
 a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.740
 Hold only the reel sheet normally 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 If you are holding the jig, you will move the reels to a great extent. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.110
 The back of the reel that is many times more than one's own weight 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.000
 It will be moved 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.270
 So it is a grip that demonstrates its worth here for that purpose 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.960
 Left and right 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:55.530
 It does not sell to the right and left for a cube 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 Take it here and you will see it now . 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.960
 Reel hardly moves 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.960
 My body is also quite love now 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.490
 First of all, a jack with a reel seat 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.229
 This will happen 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.229
 Got a grip 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.229
 of 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.770
 The body also changes a lot 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.730
 For example 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.570
 big 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.740
 In a little falling was also conscious 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.200
 sudden 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.200
 First fashion 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.890
 Conversely from the first action 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 10 big mouth made blades 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.800
 Repulsion of the flow path and a this fore grip 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.380
 In the fusion of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.150
 Just a little bit of the flow path 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.960
 This section lamp can move oneself with a short stroke 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.860
 And it becomes lighter by having the front 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.860
 The operability is considerably improved by saying 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 nani 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.200
