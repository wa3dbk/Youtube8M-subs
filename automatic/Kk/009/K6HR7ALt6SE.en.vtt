imagine if we didn't have it now we just
don't<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> feeling<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.060> would<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.270> been

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
don't get the feeling it would have been

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
don't get the feeling it would have been
fair<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.409> shine<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:36.110> think<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
fair to shine I think we actually put it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.260 
fair to shine I think we actually put it
in<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.320> initially<00:01:40.320> yeah<00:01:41.220> yeah<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> big

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in for your initially yeah yeah in a big

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.609 
in for your initially yeah yeah in a big
big<00:01:42.600> truck<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> yeah<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> also

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
big truck over there in it yeah and also

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
big truck over there in it yeah and also
you<00:01:46.619> know

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you know

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
you know
I<00:01:48.920> think<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.340> adds<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.850> tempo<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
I think it's just adds more tempo to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
I think it's just adds more tempo to
this<00:01:51.689> point<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> show<00:01:52.320> also<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.920> want<00:01:53.130> to

show our own little individual bits in a
way<00:03:30.000> though<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.239> wish<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.659> gun<00:03:30.840> well<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.469> mean<00:03:31.859> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
way though I wish the gun well I mean a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.550 
way though I wish the gun well I mean a
suppose<00:03:32.879> it's<00:03:33.150> good<00:03:33.359> for<00:03:33.629> pace<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.379> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
suppose it's good for pace there and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199 
suppose it's good for pace there and
then<00:03:34.859> they're<00:03:35.010> opening<00:03:35.489> he<00:03:35.579> keeps<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.000> thing

moving but I think probably they would
have<00:03:38.730> liked<00:03:38.939> to<00:03:38.969> cook<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.420> vegetables<00:03:39.620> hmm
