00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.020
 very good kids today I bring you a 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.430
 Video tutorial how to manage 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.260
 games saved in our 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.880
 playstation 4 we have several options what 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.860
 first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 our main account where we have 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.510
 the saved games if these accounts 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.330
 another account, then you will see 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.430
 the accounts that you have we have that there 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.320
 some adjustments and data management 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 saved from the application here we are 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.840
 will save all the applications that are 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.310
 also game voucher or program all are 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 keep us here we can manage it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 we can eliminate it we can copy it to a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.950
 pendrive that I will see now how 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 copy 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.809
 we can also copy it to the internet to the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.880
 cloud to an online storage but 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.380
 for that we have to have playstation 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.660
 plus and we do not have playstation plus no 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.969
 we can save it online and only 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 we can see save them in good pendrive 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.050
 we have these three options and we are going to 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.910
 see with the first data saved in the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 store ment system say just 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 in the console we can have three 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.520
 options we can upload it to the small 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 hard drive that we have in with plus let's 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.500
 to make this option 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.870
 we are going to give you here 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.510
 and we are going to choose for example this game 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.500
 ok we can do it automatically 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.760
 it is automatically loaded 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.160
 every time we play the game is saved 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.740
 heading goes to the water cloud will come 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.580
 independent but we have disabled 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 so that it is not continuously 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.590
 climbing up climbing is worth as 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.440
 change that with the options button 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.640
 automatic loading or we will not pass the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.990
 cloud this game is worth we give from here 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.530
 and we give to load 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.049
 and now it's going to go to the hard drive 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.549
 that we have we are worth or to the good sea 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.189
 to online storage in playstation 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.689
 we can do with all the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.549
 games with all games saved 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.439
 you can not see this these are the games 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.810
 that is a player and I have games 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.909
 saved from everything 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.890
 then I can upload all or part of 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.740
 what I want 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.750
 that is already I have it saved in the soul 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.750
 online foundation we can also copy it 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.970
 to the usb ok we are going to make copy also 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.399
 a copy is very easy 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.400
 and I'm going to show you all the steps 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:19.250
 I have the pendrive and copy usb 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.250
 and we are going to copy for example 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.300
 for example in sleeping 2 which is occupied 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.590
 50-something mega 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.810
 there will be many games as you can see 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.780
 here many games because we are going to copy 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 for example this one and this one is valid or 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.660
 you want to copy all we can 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.660
 copy all we would give to copy 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.050
 and what it takes to copy 40 seconds 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.210
 less 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.100
 and now let's see also what we can 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.790
 eliminate also the items within 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.770
 the console 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.330
 remember that we are managing now 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.460
 same inside the console itself 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.460
 then we have another series of options 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.230
 fifty-something mega 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.090
 5 seconds 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.180
 has already copied the game we want in 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.560
 our usb and now with that usb we are going to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.140
 another console and obviously what 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.880
 we will copy from the usb to the console and that's what 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.380
 let's see below we have the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.330
 option to eliminate if we want 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.900
 encourage a game that we do not like 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.760
 for example because this game is worth it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 we select and we eliminate this game 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.140
 I do not like it and we eliminate it and it's already 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.500
 the trace disappears 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.380
 see the trace of that game disappears 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.210
 because we are not going to play anymore 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.980
 and raised that we are not interested in what 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.060
 we erase are few megs many of 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.010
 you have told me this was 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.810
 as it clears the games saves that I 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.300
 I want that good game so look here what 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.000
 you have you look like I said I'm going to 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.890
 bring in the next days worth 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.170
 even the canticle of this game also 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.600
 that I'm not going to play anymore are 20 almost 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.780
 21 megs because I delete it we have here 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.940
 here we give you eliminated and better not 21 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.440
 Well see if they are many games 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.420
 I do not play, we can get to 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.450
 many media already have the first 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.280
 part of the tutorial we go with the second 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.520
 data saved in storage 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.020
 online see manages the saved data 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.310
 in online storage you can 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.739
 load the saved data 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.049
 system storage let's see 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.720
 what we have good then we are going to 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.090
 download it to the console that you can what 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.889
 options we have we give here 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.100
 and we have these two games that went up 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.990
 as you can see student sock and 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.960
 now he went up live that you can see 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.370
 this game we give you here and we return them 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.380
 to download not forgotten because I already 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.510
 we have ok we can accept or back you 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.660
 we give back or we can also delete it 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.510
 it connects with that and we can eliminate the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.520
 that we want it is uploaded 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.390
 but it can serve a lot is more are 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.090
 are examples 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.150
 is the second case is that only if 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.620
 we have and now in the in the usb vale 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.590
 we go with the saved data usb we can 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.230
 copy it copy to the same cemented the 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.810
 system say of the pendrive now towards 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.849
 the console is worth it and now it's going to 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.610
 manage we have 3 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.869
 this you see here arditti and sleeping 2 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.389
 we can select any of the 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:19.789
 three and that saved game is over 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.439
 to the console is to say that if we 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.809
 we have a console from a friend of a 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.389
 familiar neighbor or a new console 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.669
 because at home there are two consoles 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.770
 other pawns then to pass the game 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.509
 you have to do this this 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.969
 option to copy to storage 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.360
 systems from usb or we can also 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.069
 eliminate the games 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.510
 we can eliminate what we 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.000
 we want 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.860
 Well, you know, it's very easy for this 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.340
 manage it to pass the data from the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.700
 console or to the line to storage 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.890
 online or to usb this only for 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.750
 manage data online and this for 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.190
 manage from usb 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.020
