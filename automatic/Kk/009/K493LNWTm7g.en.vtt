00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.720
 before the Villarreal Villarro Garcia 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.509
 toral when you want questions you 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.370
 put nights satisfied of the result 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.470
 especially because of the behavior of his 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.210
 team that never 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.120
 In Real Madrid, he has never felt 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.990
 I do not like the result always 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.529
 has been pending 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.529
 do not 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.200
 I believe that yes I am satisfied and 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.070
 performance of my team would deserve me 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.070
 be or entered well 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.230
 well I'll be seen I like the margin 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.030
 Sometimes that will tell you precisely 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.020
 I was unhappy envy the weather 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.850
 but because of the smell they give 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.649
 very clearly and because there was 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.120
 deconcentration the markings the defense 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.480
 ease very much tranquility much 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.940
 parsimony and were you 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.140
 and using their players they think that 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.220
 deliver from that mind to see 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.750
 of the sep erbol that would have 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.170
 endured there would be a match 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.440
 different not having the first goal is a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.440
 error 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.060
 and good can happen should not happen 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.979
 and more in this field if we want to get a 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.890
 positive result but good is soccer 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.780
 and it can happen later and more to the analysis 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.909
 global and in the global analysis I think that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.409
 we have been a team excessively 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.300
 soft with very little defensive presence 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.510
 in terms of intensity 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.600
 and well we read I think that in lines 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.030
 general we have made it difficult 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.360
 Real Madrid in his attack less than 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.240
 expected I think maybe it was 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.009
 one of what goes league of our 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.009
 worst matches in the defensive aspect 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.720
 before you said that the team's skirt 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.450
 equipment lacked intensity was missing 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.610
 that competitive aggressiveness because that is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.890
 I guess the question is by 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.190
 what's there has some explanations to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.490
 that lack of intensity today are good 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.070
 matches that come out like this 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.300
 I have not been in that section what 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.750
 sufficiently intense what 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.730
 sufficiently dynamic and good we have 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 propitiated I think that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.000
 apart from the quality that the real has 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.989
 madrid- and of course he knows 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.470
 take advantage of any minimum error that 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.120
 comets because I think we have been lacking in 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.580
 that section and especially in our 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.290
 area be a bit more blunt the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.290
 Real Madrid did not have excessive arrivals 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.480
 he scored four good goals 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.270
 we can say that we made a good 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.510
 organization work but we did not do 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.330
 a good job in our area because 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.090
 it was me then I repeat I think that 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.140
 excessively tolerant to mobility 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.980
 of the rival and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.870
 and they are not intense enough 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.580
 I think we scored goals with relative 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.840
 ease independently of 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.260
 individual errors that I repeat are 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.909
 can produce 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.400
 here more feline alejandra lopez for 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.989
 digital deer today the villarreal counted 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 with many casualties you have not noticed 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.220
 excessively or has not had 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.430
 relatively important in the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.090
 development of the good party I think that 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.920
 we apart from the casualties we were 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.379
 springing up over the weekend 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.530
 like the manu who was with a 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.930
 Febrile and good process and others that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.170
 we have been suffering but that is part of 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.359
 the competition what is clear that what 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.879
 normal is that the villarreal as I notice 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:49.480
 more than in more more powerful teams 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.739
 but it's not for me that's the reason 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.409
 have lost here or if it was not me 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.329
 I think a little more competitive than what 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.819
 we have been today that the competition 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.889
 shows that in most of the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.060
 matches we show a level 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:08.870
 competitive 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.980
 and in addition to opposition to the greater rival of 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.980
 this afternoon 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.840
 to one more question that comes
