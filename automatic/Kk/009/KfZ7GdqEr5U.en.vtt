teezer
it<00:02:13.560> for<00:02:14.340> me<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.850> still<00:02:15.510> find<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.580> Y<00:02:17.880> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
it for me I still find that the Y to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.140 
it for me I still find that the Y to
comb<00:02:18.510> works<00:02:18.930> better<00:02:19.350> than<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.370> tangle<00:02:20.940> teezer

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

comb works better than the tangle teezer
I'm<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> real<00:02:22.800> big<00:02:23.010> fan<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.120> of

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
I'm not a real big fan of it I kind of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.050 
I'm not a real big fan of it I kind of
think<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.310> somewhat<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.640> denman

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
think it's somewhat like the denman

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.850 
think it's somewhat like the denman
brush<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.600> kind<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.900> feel<00:02:28.080> like<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.410> pull<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.770> away

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
brush I kind of feel like I pull it away

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.790 
brush I kind of feel like I pull it away
more<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.640> hair<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.450> denman<00:02:31.320> brush<00:02:31.350> than

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
more my hair with that denman brush than

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.260 
more my hair with that denman brush than
I<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:31.980> with<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:33.020> Y<00:02:34.020> tooth<00:02:34.350> comb<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.940> mean<00:02:36.120> I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
I do with the Y tooth comb and I mean I

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.850 
I do with the Y tooth comb and I mean I
think<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.570> good<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:39.660> hair<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:39.960> if<00:02:40.650> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
think it's good if your hair is if you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.720 
think it's good if your hair is if you

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
come through it first with a wide tooth

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.580 
come through it first with a wide tooth
comb<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:45.510> go<00:02:45.690> back<00:02:45.720> through<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.380> with

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
comb and then go back through it with

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.950 
comb and then go back through it with
the<00:02:46.950> tangle<00:02:47.310> teezer<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:48.480> tangle<00:02:48.810> teezer
