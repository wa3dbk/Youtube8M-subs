00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.330 
think that the number of the math
doesn't<00:03:43.030> work<00:03:43.209> but<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.620> honestly<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.220> would

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
doesn't work but so honestly that would

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.500 
doesn't work but so honestly that would
be<00:03:45.459> something<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.879> I<00:03:46.030> would<00:03:46.060> love<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.390> do

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
be something that I would love to do
