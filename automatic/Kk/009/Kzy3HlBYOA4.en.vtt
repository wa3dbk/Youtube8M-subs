while<00:00:00.299> we're<00:00:00.420> talking<00:00:00.599> about<00:00:00.870> food<00:00:01.220> one<00:00:02.220> of

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
while we're talking about food one of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.519 
while we're talking about food one of
the<00:00:02.580> hot-button<00:00:03.240> issues<00:00:03.840> these<00:00:04.049> days<00:00:04.110> is

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
the hot-button issues these days is

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.000 
the hot-button issues these days is
genetically<00:00:05.220> modified<00:00:05.759> foods<00:00:06.540> right<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.560> you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
genetically modified foods right and you

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.320 
genetically modified foods right and you
go<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.280> grocery<00:00:08.490> store<00:00:08.670> fruits<00:00:09.120> and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
go to the grocery store fruits and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.790 
go to the grocery store fruits and
vegetables<00:00:09.750> there's<00:00:09.929> two<00:00:10.110> sections<00:00:10.349> there's

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
vegetables there's two sections there's

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.009 
vegetables there's two sections there's
this<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.219> then<00:00:11.309> there's<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> organic<00:00:12.210> is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
this and then there's the organic is

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.820 
this and then there's the organic is
there<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> difference

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
there a difference

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.150 
there a difference
well<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.910> honest<00:00:15.240> answer<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.949> there<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
well the honest answer is there is a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.460 
well the honest answer is there is a
difference<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.930> been<00:00:19.170> genetically

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
difference because it's been genetically

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.660 
difference because it's been genetically
modified<00:00:19.939> right<00:00:21.050> which<00:00:22.340> academically<00:00:23.340> means

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
modified right which academically means

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.820 
modified right which academically means
it's<00:00:23.910> different<00:00:24.390> molecular<00:00:24.810> ly<00:00:25.289> than<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> was

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it's different molecular ly than it was

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's different molecular ly than it was
in<00:00:26.039> its<00:00:26.189> original<00:00:26.369> form<00:00:27.289> now<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.859> does<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
in its original form now what does that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.229 
in its original form now what does that
mean<00:00:29.220> nobody<00:00:30.000> knows<00:00:31.219> nobody<00:00:32.219> knows<00:00:32.579> whether

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
mean nobody knows nobody knows whether

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.120 
mean nobody knows nobody knows whether
genetically<00:00:33.899> modified<00:00:34.350> stuff<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
genetically modified stuff is going to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.500 
genetically modified stuff is going to
help<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> hurt<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.270> or

help you or if it's going to hurt you or

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
if it's going to have a net neutral

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.479 
if it's going to have a net neutral
effects<00:00:37.980> nobody<00:00:38.399> knows<00:00:38.610> now<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.860> argument

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
effects nobody knows now the argument

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.000 
effects nobody knows now the argument
here<00:00:42.030> among<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> people<00:00:43.559> who<00:00:43.770> are<00:00:44.010> non<00:00:44.430> GMO<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
here among the people who are non GMO is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
here among the people who are non GMO is
that<00:00:47.010> God<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.090> nature<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.539> smarter<00:00:49.230> than<00:00:49.260> man

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that God and nature are smarter than man

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.779 
that God and nature are smarter than man
and<00:00:50.690> every<00:00:51.690> single<00:00:51.960> time<00:00:52.430> historically<00:00:53.430> when

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and every single time historically when

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.470 
and every single time historically when
we<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.239> let<00:00:54.449> man<00:00:54.840> attempt<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.980> try<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.480> change

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
we have let man attempt to try to change

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.400 
we have let man attempt to try to change
nature<00:00:59.090> we've<00:01:00.090> always<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.719> hasn't<00:01:01.050> really

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
nature we've always it hasn't really

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.149 
nature we've always it hasn't really
worked<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.129> great<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.799> had<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
worked out that great so if I had to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.120 
worked out that great so if I had to
make<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.760> decision<00:01:06.360> based<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.950> my

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
make a decision based on just my

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.810 
make a decision based on just my
understanding<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:09.890> holistic<00:01:10.890> philosophy<00:01:11.100> and

the nature between the existence of the

human body and its relationship to
Planet<00:01:20.400> Earth<00:01:20.720> right<00:01:21.720> because<00:01:22.170> we're<00:01:22.350> part<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
Planet Earth right because we're part of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
Planet Earth right because we're part of
the<00:01:22.740> earth<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.189> mean<00:01:23.580> everything<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the earth I mean everything on the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
the earth I mean everything on the
planet<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.990> part<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> earth<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.860> a

planet is part of the earth it's a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240 
planet is part of the earth it's a
living<00:01:26.130> organism<00:01:27.200> then<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> would<00:01:28.619> say<00:01:28.890> look

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
living organism then I would say look

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.630 
living organism then I would say look
err<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.299> side<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.810> nature<00:01:31.130> rather<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
err on the side of nature rather on the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.270 
err on the side of nature rather on the
side<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> man<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> problem<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
side of man but the problem is the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.539 
side of man but the problem is the
scientific<00:01:39.119> community<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.189> signed<00:01:41.189> sealed

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
scientific community is signed sealed

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.580 
scientific community is signed sealed
and<00:01:42.329> delivered<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.350> bought<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> sold<00:01:43.979> by

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
and delivered and bought and sold by

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
and delivered and bought and sold by
agribusiness<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> by<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> pharmaceutical

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
agribusiness and by the pharmaceutical

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.530 
agribusiness and by the pharmaceutical
industry<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.799> real<00:01:50.189> objective<00:01:50.909> scientific

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
industry so real objective scientific

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.690 
industry so real objective scientific
research<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.530> whether<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.950> crap<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.520> or

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
research about whether this crap is or

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.749 
research about whether this crap is or
whether<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.060> stuff<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.140> bad<00:01:55.759> hasn't

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
whether this stuff is good or bad hasn't

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.929 
whether this stuff is good or bad hasn't
been<00:01:56.909> done<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> nobody<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.009> objectively<00:01:59.549> say

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
been done so nobody can objectively say

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.459 
been done so nobody can objectively say
yes<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.479> no<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
yes or no and so we just kind of have to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.690 
yes or no and so we just kind of have to
intuitively<00:02:04.520> figure<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.939> which<00:02:06.270> way<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> go

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
intuitively figure out which way to go

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.960 
intuitively figure out which way to go
my<00:02:08.700> advice<00:02:09.300> based<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.590> avoid<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
my advice based on that is avoid it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.990 
my advice based on that is avoid it
because<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.960> may<00:02:13.260> hurt<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:14.010> mean<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.850> may

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
because it may hurt you I mean it may

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.750 
because it may hurt you I mean it may
not<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.250> don't<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
not but it's not like you don't have to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.390 
not but it's not like you don't have to
eat<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> tomato<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> regular

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
eat a tomato you can have the regular

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.590 
eat a tomato you can have the regular
tomato<00:02:20.730> instead<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.210> their<00:02:21.330> genetically

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
tomato instead of their genetically

here however is because of

here however is because of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
modified tomato and it's bad so when we

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
start growing this stuff out in the open

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.220 
start growing this stuff out in the open
it's<00:02:59.190> only<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.430> matter<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.760> time<00:03:00.120> until<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.780> have

it's only a matter of time until we have

it's only a matter of time until we have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550

in the same way that we weren't
