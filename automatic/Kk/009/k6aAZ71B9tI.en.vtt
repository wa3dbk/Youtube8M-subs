like I think that um you know he knew
something<00:05:18.449> that<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.780> didn't<00:05:19.139> it<00:05:19.800> was<00:05:19.949> able<00:05:20.190> to

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
something that I didn't it was able to

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.560 
something that I didn't it was able to
avoid<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.550> little<00:05:20.880> bit<00:05:20.970> of<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.120> pressure<00:05:21.240> and

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
avoid a little bit of the pressure and

avoid a little bit of the pressure and
he<00:05:21.630> lived<00:05:22.139> afterwards<00:05:22.770> even<00:05:23.250> though<00:05:23.550> uh<00:05:23.580> wolf

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
he lived afterwards even though uh wolf
