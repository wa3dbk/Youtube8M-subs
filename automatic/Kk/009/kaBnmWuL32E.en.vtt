you

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:04.880 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.280 

before<00:00:05.880> we<00:00:06.000> talk<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.420> anything<00:00:06.660> about<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
before we talk to anything about the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.020 
before we talk to anything about the
large<00:00:07.500> format<00:00:07.950> photography<00:00:08.069> or<00:00:08.550> view<00:00:08.730> camera

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
large format photography or view camera

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.549 
large format photography or view camera
you<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.480> know<00:00:09.630> enough<00:00:09.750> basic<00:00:10.320> lighting

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
you have to know enough basic lighting

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.860 
you have to know enough basic lighting
so<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.250> separate<00:00:11.820> your<00:00:12.269> object<00:00:12.660> from<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
so you can separate your object from the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.060 
so you can separate your object from the
background<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.769> see<00:00:13.920> where

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
background so we can see where

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.100 
background so we can see where
everything<00:00:14.219> begins<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.879> ends<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> end

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
everything begins and ends so that end

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.210 
everything begins and ends so that end
we're<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> go<00:00:16.530> ahead<00:00:16.620> and<00:00:16.860> do<00:00:16.950> a<00:00:16.980> basic

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
we're going to go ahead and do a basic

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220 
we're going to go ahead and do a basic
lighting<00:00:17.610> setup<00:00:18.030> we<00:00:18.450> just<00:00:18.690> key<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
lighting setup we just key in a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.750 
lighting setup we just key in a
background<00:00:19.590> light<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.340> way<00:00:20.460> we'll<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.730> able

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
background light that way we'll be able

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.310 
background light that way we'll be able
to<00:00:20.910> see<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.300> object<00:00:21.660> begins<00:00:22.019> and<00:00:22.199> ends

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
to see with your object begins and ends

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.929 
to see with your object begins and ends
and<00:00:22.619> we'll<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.010> able<00:00:23.099> to<00:00:23.220> analyze<00:00:23.640> your

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and we'll be able to analyze your

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.279 
and we'll be able to analyze your
photograph<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.599> sharpness<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.199> other

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
photograph for sharpness and other

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.970 
photograph for sharpness and other
techniques<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> large<00:00:26.189> format<00:00:26.550> camera

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
techniques for the large format camera

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.380 
techniques for the large format camera
so<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.250> go<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> our<00:00:29.580> line<00:00:29.820> our<00:00:29.970> subject

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
so when we go to our line our subject

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.550 
so when we go to our line our subject
we're<00:00:30.509> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> start<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.019> our<00:00:31.170> key<00:00:31.349> light

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
we're going to start with our key light

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.770 
we're going to start with our key light
the<00:00:32.430> whole<00:00:32.580> point<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.060> key<00:00:33.240> light<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the whole point of a key light is to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750 
the whole point of a key light is to
give<00:00:34.020> direction<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> subject<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.670> I'll

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
give direction to the subject so I'll

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
give direction to the subject so I'll
turn<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.059> my<00:00:36.149> key<00:00:36.329> light<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.540> I'll<00:00:36.750> adjust<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
turn on my key light and I'll adjust it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
turn on my key light and I'll adjust it
I<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.280> relatively<00:00:38.820> contrasting

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I want it to be relatively contrasting

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.850 
I want it to be relatively contrasting
on<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:39.750> subject<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> be

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
on my subject and I want it to be

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
on my subject and I want it to be
relatively<00:00:41.250> close<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.850> subject<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.690> will

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
relatively close to my subject that will

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
relatively close to my subject that will
add<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> contrast<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.770> need<00:00:46.340> then<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:47.430> go

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
add the contrast I need then I'll go

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
add the contrast I need then I'll go
over<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.000> background<00:00:48.449> light<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.989> I'll<00:00:49.379> put

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
over to my background light and I'll put

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
over to my background light and I'll put
on<00:00:49.739> my<00:00:49.860> background<00:00:50.070> light<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:51.120> thing<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.390> want

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
on my background light one thing I want

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
on my background light one thing I want
to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> adjust<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.469> background<00:00:52.980> light

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to do when I adjust my background light

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.470 
to do when I adjust my background light
is<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:53.940> sure<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> my

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
is I want to make sure that my

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
is I want to make sure that my
background<00:00:54.690> light<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.500> hitting<00:00:55.800> my

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
background light is not hitting my

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
background light is not hitting my
subject<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.820> only<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.600> is

to<00:00:58.020> work<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.620> light<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.699> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to work with one light at a time you can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.599 
to work with one light at a time you can
flip<00:01:00.030> off<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.899> subject<00:01:01.320> light<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.399> key

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
flip off your subject light or your key

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.170 
flip off your subject light or your key

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
light as I look at this I want to make

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
light as I look at this I want to make
sure<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.540> light<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.870> overall<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> flat<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
sure this light is overall in flat I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310 
sure this light is overall in flat I
want<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.490> gentle<00:01:08.820> gradation<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> don't<00:01:10.170> want

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
want a gentle gradation but I don't want

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
want a gentle gradation but I don't want
any<00:01:10.530> real<00:01:10.800> contrast<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.550> my<00:01:11.640> background<00:01:12.060> light

any real contrast on my background light
I<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.840> most<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.230> my<00:01:13.320> contrast<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.070> key

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I want most of my contrast on my key

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.790 
I want most of my contrast on my key
light<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:15.150> key<00:01:15.360> light<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.780> therefore<00:01:16.260> close<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
light my key light is therefore close to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.010 
light my key light is therefore close to
my<00:01:16.890> subject<00:01:17.310> will<00:01:18.030> create<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.300> lot<00:01:18.480> of<00:01:18.510> contrast

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
my subject will create a lot of contrast

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
my subject will create a lot of contrast
my<00:01:19.500> background<00:01:19.920> light<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> generally<00:01:20.910> far

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
my background light is generally far

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
my background light is generally far
away<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.630> background<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.590> create

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
away from my background that will create

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
away from my background that will create
a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:22.950> more<00:01:23.070> flat<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.790> therefore<00:01:24.630> now

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
a little more flat so therefore now

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.750 
a little more flat so therefore now
let's<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.260> is<00:01:25.320> look<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.370> I<00:01:26.460> maintain

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
let's do is look and see if I maintain

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.360 
let's do is look and see if I maintain
light<00:01:27.720> areas<00:01:28.200> against<00:01:28.530> dark<00:01:28.740> areas<00:01:29.070> dark

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
ready to capture my picture and I can
get<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.050> separation<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.680> need<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.340> see

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
get the separation I need so you can see

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
get the separation I need so you can see
what<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.760> shooting<00:01:36.020> okay<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.080> now<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.470> my

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
what I'm shooting okay so now I have my

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.380 
what I'm shooting okay so now I have my
key<00:01:37.950> light<00:01:37.980> that's<00:01:38.370> giving<00:01:38.790> direction<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> my

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
key light that's giving direction to my

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
key light that's giving direction to my
subject<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.320> background<00:01:40.740> light

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
subject I have my background light

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.380 
subject I have my background light
that's<00:01:41.160> giving<00:01:41.520> illumination<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.300> my

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that's giving illumination of my

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.550 
that's giving illumination of my
background<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:42.900> again<00:01:43.140> most<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
background but again most of the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
background but again most of the
contrast<00:01:43.980> is<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.430> subject<00:01:44.670> you'll<00:01:44.940> notice

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
contrast is on my subject you'll notice

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.430 
contrast is on my subject you'll notice
the<00:01:45.300> only<00:01:45.360> thing<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.690> not<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.110> picture

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
the only thing it's not in my picture

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.350 
the only thing it's not in my picture
right<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> camera<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.850> much<00:01:48.030> easier

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
right now as a camera it's much easier

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.790 
right now as a camera it's much easier
to<00:01:48.420> work<00:01:48.690> your<00:01:48.900> lighting<00:01:49.260> and<00:01:49.410> your<00:01:49.470> setup

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
to work your lighting and your setup

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.710 
to work your lighting and your setup
without<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.250> camera<00:01:50.550> than<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.940> with<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
without the camera than it is with it so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
without the camera than it is with it so
at<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.900> point<00:01:52.080> I'll<00:01:52.230> add<00:01:52.410> my<00:01:52.620> camera<00:01:53.010> I'll

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
at this point I'll add my camera I'll

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
at this point I'll add my camera I'll
double-check<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.150> framing<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.660> I'm<00:01:54.720> ready<00:01:54.900> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
double-check my framing and I'm ready to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.470 
double-check my framing and I'm ready to
take<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.320> picture<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.330> have<00:01:57.450> our

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
take my picture now that we have our

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.090 
take my picture now that we have our
subjects<00:01:57.960> lit<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> way<00:01:58.410> we<00:01:58.590> need<00:01:58.770> for

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
subjects lit the way we need for

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
subjects lit the way we need for
everything<00:01:59.490> light<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.270> our<00:02:00.360> subject<00:02:00.570> just

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
everything light and our subject just

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
everything light and our subject just
opposes<00:02:01.290> something<00:02:01.590> dark<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:01.950> everything's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
opposes something dark and everything's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.860 
opposes something dark and everything's
aren't<00:02:02.580> just<00:02:02.820> opposes<00:02:03.210> something<00:02:03.510> light<00:02:03.690> we

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
aren't just opposes something light we

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.170 
aren't just opposes something light we
need<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> calculate<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.860> exposure<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.910> can<00:02:06.060> do

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
need to calculate the exposure we can do

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.059 
need to calculate the exposure we can do
an<00:02:06.300> infinite<00:02:06.570> reading<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.680> read<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
an infinite reading that is we read the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.410 
an infinite reading that is we read the
amount<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> light<00:02:08.550> falling<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> subject

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
amount of light falling on the subject

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
amount of light falling on the subject
for<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> reflective<00:02:11.220> reading<00:02:11.489> in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
for you to do a reflective reading in

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.800 
for you to do a reflective reading in
this<00:02:11.850> case<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.270> incident

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
this case in the incident

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.490 
this case in the incident
is<00:02:13.080> okay<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.000> problem<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.510> our<00:02:15.750> incident

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
is okay but the problem is our incident

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.080 
is okay but the problem is our incident
reading<00:02:16.770> doesn't<00:02:16.950> take<00:02:17.190> into<00:02:17.340> account<00:02:17.459> that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
reading doesn't take into account that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.990 
reading doesn't take into account that
our<00:02:18.330> subjects<00:02:18.750> entirely<00:02:19.050> white<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:20.580> incident

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
our subjects entirely white the incident

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.490 
our subjects entirely white the incident
reading<00:02:21.239> would<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:21.360> exactly<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.020> same<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.380> our

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
reading would be exactly the same of our

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.010 
reading would be exactly the same of our
subject<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.099> entirety<00:02:23.459> black<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.870> this

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
subject was entirety black so in this

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.479 
subject was entirety black so in this
case<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> reflective<00:02:25.860> green<00:02:26.010> would<00:02:26.220> probably

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
case a reflective green would probably

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.330 
case a reflective green would probably
be<00:02:26.550> more<00:02:26.760> accurate<00:02:27.620> okay<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.010> decide<00:02:29.280> to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
be more accurate okay so if we decide to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.009 
be more accurate okay so if we decide to
do<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.550> reflective<00:02:30.090> reading<00:02:30.390> what<00:02:30.870> are<00:02:30.930> we

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
do a reflective reading what are we

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.330 
do a reflective reading what are we
going<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.260> reflect<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> raining<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.099> we

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
going to do reflect the raining on we

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.740 
going to do reflect the raining on we
have<00:02:32.459> blacks<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.239> whites<00:02:33.450> what<00:02:33.630> we

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
have blacks and we have whites what we

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.630 
have blacks and we have whites what we
really<00:02:33.989> don't<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.349> middle<00:02:34.590> value<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:35.250> this

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
really don't have a middle value in this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.790 
really don't have a middle value in this
case<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.060> could<00:02:36.180> use<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> gray<00:02:36.690> card<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> gray

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
case we could use a gray card but a gray

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.199 
case we could use a gray card but a gray
card<00:02:38.010> probably<00:02:38.250> wouldn't<00:02:38.610> help<00:02:38.730> us<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.000> much

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
card probably wouldn't help us that much

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.030 
card probably wouldn't help us that much
either<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.599> could<00:02:39.750> also<00:02:39.900> pick<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.620> spot<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
either we could also pick a spot in the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.339 
either we could also pick a spot in the
background<00:02:41.459> that's<00:02:41.910> our<00:02:42.060> middle<00:02:42.300> value<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.019> we

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
background that's our middle value or we

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.660 
background that's our middle value or we
could<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.590> what's<00:02:43.769> called<00:02:43.920> placing<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.489> light

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
could do what's called placing a light

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.910 
could do what's called placing a light
we<00:02:45.180> know<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.630> our<00:02:45.750> white<00:02:45.959> values<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.650> stops

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
we know that our white values to stops

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800 
we know that our white values to stops
over<00:02:47.370> our<00:02:47.640> middle<00:02:47.940> values<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.510> could<00:02:48.660> just

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
over our middle values so we could just

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.660 
over our middle values so we could just
read<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.170> white<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.590> increase<00:02:50.400> our<00:02:50.519> exposure

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
read the white and increase our exposure

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.699 
read the white and increase our exposure
by<00:02:51.150> two<00:02:51.209> steps<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.049> that<00:02:52.140> case<00:02:52.350> that's<00:02:52.530> what

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
by two steps so in that case that's what

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.490 
by two steps so in that case that's what
I<00:02:52.769> think<00:02:53.040> I'll<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.310> okay<00:02:54.019> after<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.170> get<00:02:55.260> my

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I think I'll do okay after I get my

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
I think I'll do okay after I get my
exposure<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.280> my<00:02:56.700> subject<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.540> take

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
exposure of my subject I have to take

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.960 
exposure of my subject I have to take
into<00:02:57.900> consideration<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.739> more<00:02:58.950> factor<00:02:59.340> I'm

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
into consideration one more factor I'm

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.870 
into consideration one more factor I'm
using<00:03:00.239> an<00:03:00.450> eight-inch<00:03:00.810> lens<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.410> my<00:03:02.400> bellows

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
using an eight-inch lens and my bellows

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.640 
using an eight-inch lens and my bellows
is<00:03:03.120> quite<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> bit<00:03:03.959> longer<00:03:04.140> than<00:03:04.500> eight<00:03:04.620> inches

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
is quite a bit longer than eight inches

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.979 
is quite a bit longer than eight inches
so<00:03:05.519> therefore<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.060> light<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.330> as<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
so therefore the light that as it

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.660 
so therefore the light that as it
travels<00:03:07.349> from<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.650> lens<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> ground

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
travels from the lens to the ground

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.309 
travels from the lens to the ground
glass<00:03:08.819> or<00:03:09.360> through<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.690> film<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.110> losing

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
glass or through the film is losing

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.229 
glass or through the film is losing
intensity<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.519> question<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:11.910> how<00:03:12.060> much

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
intensity the question is how much

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.309 
intensity the question is how much
intensity<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.870> losing

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
intensity is losing

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.600 
intensity is losing
well<00:03:13.500> that's<00:03:13.650> dictated<00:03:14.130> by<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> inverse

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
well that's dictated by the inverse

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.309 
well that's dictated by the inverse
square<00:03:14.819> law<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.630> there's<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.870> simple<00:03:16.049> way<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
square law but there's a simple way to

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.319 
square law but there's a simple way to
apply<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:17.190> measure<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.790> bellows<00:03:18.120> in

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
apply it just measure the bellows in

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.390 
apply it just measure the bellows in
this<00:03:18.600> case<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.049> would<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.230> about<00:03:19.769> twelve<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.310> a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
this case it would be about twelve and a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.789 
this case it would be about twelve and a
half<00:03:20.430> inches<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:22.079> know<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.380> length<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.739> the

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
half inches and I know the length of the

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.860 
half inches and I know the length of the
lens<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.190> inches<00:03:23.489> which<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.880> eight<00:03:24.030> inches<00:03:24.359> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
lens in inches which is eight inches so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.170 
lens in inches which is eight inches so
I<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.140> plot<00:03:25.380> eight<00:03:25.769> inches<00:03:26.250> versus<00:03:26.910> twelve

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
I can plot eight inches versus twelve

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.550 
I can plot eight inches versus twelve
and<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.359> half<00:03:27.390> inches<00:03:27.630> on<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.079> f-stop<00:03:28.380> scale

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and a half inches on the f-stop scale

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.229 
and a half inches on the f-stop scale
and<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.310> difference<00:03:29.640> between<00:03:29.790> eight<00:03:30.209> and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
and the difference between eight and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.970 
and the difference between eight and
twelve<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.870> half<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.200> about<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> stop<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.920> a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
twelve and a half is about a stop and a

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.740 
twelve and a half is about a stop and a
half<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.459> I'll<00:03:32.579> have<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.910> add<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> stop<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.690> a

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
half so I'll have to add a stop and a

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.809 
half so I'll have to add a stop and a
half<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.140> my<00:03:34.319> exposure<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:35.250> order<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.549> get<00:03:35.700> the

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
half to my exposure in order to get the

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.300 
half to my exposure in order to get the
correct<00:03:36.030> exposure<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:37.319> placing<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> white

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
correct exposure the placing the white

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.949 
correct exposure the placing the white
and<00:03:38.609> figuring<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.359> bellows<00:03:39.630> factor

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
and figuring out the bellows factor

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.660 
and figuring out the bellows factor
sometimes<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.530> easiest<00:03:40.920> way<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.519> don't

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
sometimes the easiest way so you don't

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.190 
sometimes the easiest way so you don't
have<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.910> confuse<00:03:42.269> yourself<00:03:42.359> just<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.079> ahead

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
have to confuse yourself just go ahead

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.680 
have to confuse yourself just go ahead
and<00:03:43.560> dial<00:03:43.829> those<00:03:44.220> figures<00:03:44.790> into<00:03:45.209> your<00:03:45.329> ISO

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and dial those figures into your ISO

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.110 
and dial those figures into your ISO
meaning<00:03:46.139> tell<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.280> camera<00:03:47.639> you're<00:03:47.790> shooting

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
meaning tell the camera you're shooting

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.879 
meaning tell the camera you're shooting
slower<00:03:48.420> film<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.470> tell<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.739> camera

slower film if you tell the camera
you're<00:03:50.130> shooting<00:03:50.430> slower<00:03:50.670> film<00:03:50.970> it'll<00:03:51.239> add

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
you're shooting slower film it'll add

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.509 
you're shooting slower film it'll add
that<00:03:51.420> extra<00:03:51.870> exposure<00:03:52.350> automatically<00:03:53.250> to

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
that extra exposure automatically to

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.640 
that extra exposure automatically to
your<00:03:53.549> exposure<00:03:54.000> readings<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:55.019> if<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.440> have<00:03:55.620> a

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
your exposure readings so if I have a

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.319 
your exposure readings so if I have a
one-and-a-half<00:03:56.069> stop<00:03:56.430> bellows<00:03:56.760> factor<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> go

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
one-and-a-half stop bellows factor I go

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.879 
one-and-a-half stop bellows factor I go

for one stop ISO eight or the other stop
now<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.209> have<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.840> take<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.109> reflective

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
now as I have to do is take a reflective

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.319 
now as I have to do is take a reflective
reading<00:04:11.040> off<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.549> white<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.000> I'm<00:04:12.090> good<00:04:12.239> to

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
reading off of a white and I'm good to

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.009 
reading off of a white and I'm good to
go

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.939 

okay<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.079> what<00:04:19.380> we're<00:04:19.530> trying<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.799> achieve

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
okay so what we're trying to achieve

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.009 
okay so what we're trying to achieve
again<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.579> basic<00:04:20.940> lighting<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.479> everything

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
again in basic lighting is everything

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.659 
again in basic lighting is everything
light<00:04:22.229> just<00:04:22.560> propose<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.860> something<00:04:23.280> darker

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
light just propose a something darker

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.640 
light just propose a something darker
everything<00:04:24.539> dark<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.139> oppose<00:04:25.470> with

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
everything dark just oppose with

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.230 
everything dark just oppose with
something<00:04:25.979> lighter<00:04:26.220> light<00:04:26.639> against<00:04:27.030> dark

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
something lighter light against dark

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.210 
something lighter light against dark
dark<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.780> slight<00:04:28.020> light<00:04:28.710> against<00:04:28.949> dark

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
dark and slight light against dark

dark and slight light against dark
circles<00:04:29.729> light<00:04:29.880> darkens<00:04:30.389> light<00:04:30.599> light

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
circles light darkens light light

circles light darkens light light
against<00:04:31.169> dark<00:04:31.440> we<00:04:31.949> do<00:04:32.099> that<00:04:32.310> we<00:04:32.460> have<00:04:32.580> good

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
against dark we do that we have good

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.180
