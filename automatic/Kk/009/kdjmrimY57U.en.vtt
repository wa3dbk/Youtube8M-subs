00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.300 
nice because having competition on both
levels<00:01:57.420> seems<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.530> appropriate<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.009> both

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
levels seems to be appropriate for both

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
levels seems to be appropriate for both
the<00:01:59.640> casual<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.509> competitive<00:02:00.990> player<00:02:01.200> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the casual and the competitive player so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
the casual and the competitive player so
tell<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.369> guys<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.630> about<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
tell me guys what you think about this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
tell me guys what you think about this
do<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:06.180> step

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
do you think it's you know a right step

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.210 
do you think it's you know a right step
in<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:06.869> direction<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.920> assume

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
in the right direction for this I assume

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
in the right direction for this I assume
we'll<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.640> something<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.330> every

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
we'll get something like this for every

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.460 
we'll get something like this for every
regional<00:02:10.379> season

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
regional season

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.020 
regional season
really<00:02:11.860> looking<00:02:12.070> forward<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.520> myself

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
really looking forward to this myself

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.390 
really looking forward to this myself
