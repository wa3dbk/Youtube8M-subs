00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
so this I just finished up the gable end

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.539 
so this I just finished up the gable end
with<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> door<00:03:18.969> in<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.329> man<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.659> was<00:03:20.549> this

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
with the door in it man this was this

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.860 
with the door in it man this was this
was<00:03:21.760> really<00:03:22.060> calm<00:03:22.299> complicated<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:24.870> built

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
was really calm complicated so I built

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.559 
was really calm complicated so I built
it<00:03:26.049> in<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.230> shop<00:03:26.439> so<00:03:26.680> whether<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.129> fits<00:03:27.280> or<00:03:27.489> not

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
it in the shop so whether it fits or not

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.119 
it in the shop so whether it fits or not
we'll<00:03:28.569> find<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:28.900> now<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.379> modifications

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
we'll find out now and modifications

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.300 
we'll find out now and modifications
from<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> original<00:03:30.819> plans<00:03:31.150> II<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.290> think<00:03:32.920> it'll

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
from the original plans II I think it'll

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.369 
from the original plans II I think it'll
work<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.849> you<00:03:33.969> can<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.450> be<00:03:34.900> able<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.109> lift<00:03:35.230> it

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
work can you can you be able to lift it

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.860 
work can you can you be able to lift it
careful<00:03:36.219> because<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.489> is<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:37.000> glue<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.810> not

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
careful because it is the glue is not

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.899 
careful because it is the glue is not
