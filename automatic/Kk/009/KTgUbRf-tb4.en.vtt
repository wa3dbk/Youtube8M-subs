 at the adventurers the saints 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.230
 grave chambers of the pyramid called Wide 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 1699 or a polish ship with two 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.500
 mummies on board of ghostly ones 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.630
 Apparitions and murderous storms 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.519
 haunted 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.019
 In 1803, four expedition members entered 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970
 the shepherdess pyramid and never returned 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.740
 back 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.900
 In 1922, tutankhamun's tomb was opened 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 and the excavation team overtook one 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.489
 series of horrific deaths in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.450
 The following 91 years were none 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.899
 further graves desecrated wait until 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.899
 now 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.109
 what happened to him taxi cellar 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.059
 Usually found in graves and 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.890
 grooving in buildings that was sealed 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.629
 as you can see has the pyramid 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.760
 the excavated is only three pages 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.129
 no more like the pyramids of giza 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.449
 but how is that over? 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.820
 says we can not go there 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.899
 That's the fund of the century you 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.490
 Do not really believe that I am there 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:12.420
 do not go in close together 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.420
 and does not move 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:21.140
 the reliefs tell a story it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:32.240
 is a warm apartment where in front of you 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:32.750
 Slowly it's back to the other one 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.310
 labyrinth 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.780
 it was built around that whatever 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.780
 in here is to prevent the escape 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.300
 come on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.240
 when we get it down 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.650
