it's pretty much like a loaf I start
with<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> huge<00:01:32.070> loaf<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.549> bread<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.270> slice<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
with a huge loaf of bread and I slice it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.560 
with a huge loaf of bread and I slice it
up<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:35.040> panels<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:36.360> begin

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
up into into panels then I will begin

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.700 
up into into panels then I will begin
writing<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.630> generally<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> write<00:01:40.409> with

the words and pictures at the same time

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
the words and pictures at the same time
and<00:01:44.009> I'll<00:01:44.130> lay<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.340> each<00:01:44.700> page<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:48.090> 8<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:48.780> 10

typewriter sheet do it in pencil form

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.300 
typewriter sheet do it in pencil form
pretty<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> figures<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> roughly

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
pretty about the figures of roughly

pretty about the figures of roughly
drawing<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.880> balloons<00:01:57.210> putting<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:57.840> after

drawing the balloons putting then after
I've<00:01:58.200> completed<00:01:58.799> at<00:01:59.070> all<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.549> will<00:02:00.409> then

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
I've completed at all I will then

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.480 
I've completed at all I will then
sometimes<00:02:03.880> cut<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.300> apart<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:05.260> rearrange<00:02:05.980> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
sometimes cut it apart and rearrange the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.910 
sometimes cut it apart and rearrange the
sequences<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.210> change<00:02:07.510> timing<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.890> right

sequences to change timing and the right

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.870 
sequences to change timing and the right
and<00:02:09.340> slow<00:02:10.149> something<00:02:10.600> up<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:10.960> example

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and slow something up for example

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.510 
and slow something up for example
sometimes<00:02:12.880> it'll<00:02:13.570> be<00:02:14.560> necessary<00:02:14.800> for<00:02:15.280> me<00:02:15.490> to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
sometimes it'll be necessary for me to

the man lying in the alley talking to a
cockroach<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.310> had<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.390> bring<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.490> picture

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
cockroach I had to bring the picture

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.120 
cockroach I had to bring the picture
being<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.300> audience<00:02:28.720> right<00:02:28.959> up<00:02:29.140> close<00:02:29.320> so

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
being the audience right up close so

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.949 
being the audience right up close so
that<00:02:30.160> they<00:02:30.610> could<00:02:30.790> see<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> cockroach<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.720> him

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
that they could see the cockroach in him

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.600 
that they could see the cockroach in him
at<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> same<00:02:32.410> time<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> took<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.130> whole<00:02:33.310> page

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
at the same time and I took a whole page

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.790 
at the same time and I took a whole page
to<00:02:33.850> do<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.180> rather<00:02:34.420> than<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.690> little<00:02:35.440> panel

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
to do that rather than a little panel

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680 
to do that rather than a little panel
because<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.130> felt<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.580> wanted<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.180> bring<00:02:37.510> my

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
because I felt I wanted to bring my

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.310 
because I felt I wanted to bring my

reader in to the picture itself I when

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.390 
reader in to the picture itself I when
I'm<00:02:41.470> writing<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:42.400> write<00:02:42.910> by<00:02:43.120> sound<00:02:44.400> there's

I'm writing I write by sound there's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.550 
I'm writing I write by sound there's
almost<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.730> metronome<00:02:46.120> going<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:46.989> head<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
almost a metronome going in my head and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.340 
almost a metronome going in my head and
I<00:02:48.010> write<00:02:48.250> with<00:02:48.489> almost<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.910> drumbeat<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.690> I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
I write with almost a drumbeat and I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.960 
I write with almost a drumbeat and I
think<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.800> my<00:02:50.950> work<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:52.080> as<00:02:53.080> being<00:02:53.970> sometimes

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
think of my work as as being sometimes

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.130 
think of my work as as being sometimes
very<00:02:55.420> close<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> ballet<00:02:57.690> I'll<00:02:58.690> have<00:02:58.989> my

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
very close to a ballet I'll have my

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.890 
very close to a ballet I'll have my
characters<00:02:59.620> move<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.880> almost<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.660> ballet

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
characters move in almost a ballet

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.160 
characters move in almost a ballet
sequence<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.239> balloon<00:03:04.510> sometimes<00:03:04.989> I

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
sequence with the balloon sometimes I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.370 
sequence with the balloon sometimes I
will<00:03:05.380> very<00:03:06.160> often<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.820> will<00:03:07.060> eliminate<00:03:07.510> two<00:03:08.260> or

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
will very often I will eliminate two or

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.740 
will very often I will eliminate two or
three<00:03:08.530> pages<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.160> bull<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.549> balloons<00:03:09.940> simply

three pages of a bull of balloons simply

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.979 
three pages of a bull of balloons simply
because<00:03:11.049> I<00:03:11.200> feel<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.840> characters<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
because I feel that the characters the

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.710 
because I feel that the characters the

conveying<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:18.060> I've<00:03:19.060> experimented<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.870> this

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
conveying it I've experimented with this

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.500 
conveying it I've experimented with this
stuff<00:03:20.410> because<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.900> very<00:03:23.170> very<00:03:24.510> very

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
stuff because it is a very very very

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.570 
stuff because it is a very very very
sophisticated<00:03:25.930> idea<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:26.980> very<00:03:27.340> often

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
sophisticated idea and very often

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.789 
sophisticated idea and very often
difficult<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.600> attain<00:03:29.049> unless<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.590> really
