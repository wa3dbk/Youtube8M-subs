00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.090 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:14.259 

you

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.470 

seems<00:00:15.049> to<00:00:15.259> me<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:15.559> root<00:00:15.769> of<00:00:15.919> this<00:00:16.129> is<00:00:16.480> unsound

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
seems to me the root of this is unsound

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.099 
seems to me the root of this is unsound
money<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:19.240> we've<00:00:20.240> got<00:00:20.420> ourselves<00:00:20.539> into<00:00:21.020> a

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
money and we've got ourselves into a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.409 
money and we've got ourselves into a
situation<00:00:21.380> where<00:00:22.250> money<00:00:23.090> has<00:00:23.270> been

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
situation where money has been

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.380 
situation where money has been
monopolized<00:00:24.110> by<00:00:24.289> central<00:00:24.829> banks<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.430> their

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
monopolized by central banks and their

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.839 
monopolized by central banks and their
only<00:00:26.689> solution<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.470> any<00:00:27.680> problem<00:00:27.829> now<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.789> the

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
only solution to any problem now and the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.850 
only solution to any problem now and the
problems<00:00:29.180> have<00:00:29.300> become<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:29.840> great<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.529> only

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
problems have become so great the only

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.200 
problems have become so great the only
solution<00:00:31.279> they<00:00:31.369> have<00:00:31.579> is<00:00:31.759> to<00:00:31.910> produce<00:00:32.059> more

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
solution they have is to produce more

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.670 
solution they have is to produce more
and<00:00:32.570> more<00:00:33.129> fiat<00:00:34.129> money<00:00:34.610> I<00:00:34.910> do<00:00:35.350> feel<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:36.379> this

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
and more fiat money I do feel that this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.770 
and more fiat money I do feel that this
is<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:36.890> if<00:00:37.700> you<00:00:37.820> like<00:00:37.969> central<00:00:38.539> to<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.750> whole

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
is a if you like central to the whole

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.380 
is a if you like central to the whole
problem<00:00:39.170> or<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.309> what<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.730> just<00:00:41.030> part<00:00:41.270> of

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
problem or is it what is it just part of

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.959

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
then they've got into the situation

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.880 
then they've got into the situation

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.430 
debt trap which seems to me there is
virtually<00:02:37.760> no<00:02:38.240> visible<00:02:38.750> means<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.050> escaping

them<00:05:11.029> but<00:05:11.449> it's<00:05:11.599> not<00:05:11.749> going<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.020> happen<00:05:12.139> as<00:05:12.439> far

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
them but it's not going to happen as far

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.369 
them but it's not going to happen as far
as<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.770> can<00:05:12.830> see<00:05:12.979> because<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:14.689> ECB<00:05:15.080> has<00:05:15.169> got<00:05:15.349> a

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
as I can see because the ECB has got a

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.990 
as I can see because the ECB has got a
huge<00:05:15.590> problem<00:05:15.680> stopping<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.550> banking<00:05:16.879> system

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
huge problem stopping the banking system

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.760 
huge problem stopping the banking system
falling<00:05:17.539> over<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:17.990> can't<00:05:18.169> do<00:05:18.319> both<00:05:18.500> at<00:05:18.680> the

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
falling over and it can't do both at the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.679 
falling over and it can't do both at the
same<00:05:18.860> time<00:05:19.250> you<00:05:19.759> look<00:05:19.939> at<00:05:20.029> the<00:05:20.150> collapse<00:05:20.479> of

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
same time you look at the collapse of

chequebook exactly no contract so they

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.480
