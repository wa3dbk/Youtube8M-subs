00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:09.000
 the movie radio with dante halo film fritz 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.170
 and nice to be with you again 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.049
 at the movie radio 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.880
 I sat at the laptop one evening and have 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.859
 me just about economics and politics 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.859
 informed as I suddenly following 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.529
 quote heard george has his penis 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.480
 checked because something was in my vagina 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.519
 clearly that was not angela merkels 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 internet podcast because she has none 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.630
 friend called george but piranhas 2 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.820
 and to check exactly if there 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.930
 really what was in her vagina 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 I of course the movie again 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.960
 look at 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 The horror comedy Piranhas 2 comes from 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.610
 the year 2012 and is the continuation 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 from piranhas 3d the first part 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.030
 It's just over a year ago 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 numerous piranha attacks on the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 Population around the Victoria Lake 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.070
 given 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 now there are two at the beginning of the film 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.590
 angler kuka was in the lake in the squad 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.210
 but even they find piranha and yes 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.550
 So the wild hunt goes off again 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 Let's start piranha 2 right now 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.210
 somehow fun and he was quite 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.129
 Offensively designed to a movie 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.409
 be drunk with friends 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.810
 should look or even without alcohol 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.890
 I think it's somehow real 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 entertaining and so funny that sounds 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 but at 12 places I have also real 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.150
 short but only very briefly thought wow that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.979
 robert rodriguez could be of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.810
 another highlight is of course 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.909
 David Hasselhoff and some killing 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 scenes so it's wonderful and fun 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.770
 is also really fun all in all 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 but of course it's a lot 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 below average film around it 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 to express positively 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 the special effects I think I would have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 can still produce and the 3d 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 effect is not so the hamas goes 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.549
 So basically just in the direction of comedy 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.960
 instead of horror short and sweet for 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.530
 What he wants to be is great 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 otherwise he shit piranhas 2 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.899
 lasts 82 minutes and currently has 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 almost 24,000 ratings on imdb one 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.470
 average rating of 39 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.439
 I go even deeper and deeper 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.450
 So give 29 points so a 29 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.280
 now to you how did you find the film 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.270
 agreed with me then post it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.130
 your opinion 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.659
 We will then listen to the next film 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.659
 again and until then, I say
