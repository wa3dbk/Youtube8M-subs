used to feel nicer than aluminum one I
don't<00:00:32.619> know<00:00:32.680> it<00:00:32.770> just<00:00:32.800> seems<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.370> feel

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
don't know it just seems to feel

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.930 
don't know it just seems to feel
smoother<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:34.510> more<00:00:35.170> flowing<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.820> very

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
smoother and more flowing that's very

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.420 
smoother and more flowing that's very
nice<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.750> also

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430

a<00:00:39.490> stream<00:00:40.330> I've<00:00:40.690> heard<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.200> it's<00:00:41.920> not<00:00:42.160> as

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
a stream I've heard that it's not as

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.540 
a stream I've heard that it's not as
bright<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:43.410> guess<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.530> could<00:00:44.560> argue<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:45.040> but

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
bright I guess you could argue that but

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.170 
bright I guess you could argue that but
it's<00:00:45.730> not<00:00:45.910> like<00:00:46.450> it's<00:00:46.660> horrible<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:47.890> is<00:00:48.100> at

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
it's not like it's horrible this is at

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.650 
it's not like it's horrible this is at
this<00:00:50.480> is<00:00:50.630> that<00:00:50.810> max<00:00:51.400> that's<00:00:52.400> max

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
this is that max that's max

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.170 
this is that max that's max
and<00:00:53.780> then<00:00:53.960> of<00:00:54.230> course<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.680> guessed<00:00:54.920> immer

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
and then of course you guessed immer

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.050 
and then of course you guessed immer

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.910 
computer except for one complaint I was
looking<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:45.420> buying<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.990> computer<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.650> mean

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
looking into buying this computer I mean

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.950 
looking into buying this computer I mean
it's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.130> thousand<00:01:47.550> dollars<00:01:47.820> pretty<00:01:48.390> good<00:01:48.740> but

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's a thousand dollars pretty good but

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.750 
it's a thousand dollars pretty good but
it<00:01:51.229> seems<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.650> like<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:51.799> scratches<00:01:52.430> really

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
it seems to like it scratches really

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.910 
it seems to like it scratches really
easily<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.390> don't<00:01:54.110> know<00:01:54.170> if<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.350> guys<00:01:54.470> can<00:01:54.530> see

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
easily I don't know if you guys can see

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.600 
easily I don't know if you guys can see
that<00:01:55.070> right<00:01:56.229> all<00:01:57.229> over<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.590> place<00:01:57.799> those

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
that right all over the place those

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.670 
that right all over the place those
cameras<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.479> camera<00:01:59.810> doesn't<00:02:00.110> auto<00:02:00.229> focus

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
cameras this camera doesn't auto focus

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.649 
cameras this camera doesn't auto focus
so<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.550> see<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.760> extract<00:02:02.150> is<00:02:02.330> all<00:02:02.479> over

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
so you can see it extract is all over

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.080 
so you can see it extract is all over
and<00:02:03.050> this<00:02:04.040> computer's<00:02:04.550> only<00:02:04.759> been<00:02:04.940> out<00:02:05.030> for

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
and this computer's only been out for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.999 
and this computer's only been out for
like<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.780> week<00:02:06.409> not<00:02:07.070> even<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.430> week<00:02:07.610> and

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
like a week not even a week and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.399 
like a week not even a week and
it<00:02:10.489> has<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:10.789> many<00:02:10.879> scratches<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.659> mean<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.260> a

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
it has so many scratches I mean it is a

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.990 
it has so many scratches I mean it is a
store<00:02:12.830> where<00:02:12.980> people<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.459> scratch<00:02:13.790> in

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
store where people can scratch in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000 
store where people can scratch in
everything<00:02:14.420> but<00:02:14.629> I've<00:02:14.810> heard<00:02:15.049> other<00:02:15.200> reviews

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
everything but I've heard other reviews

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.440 
everything but I've heard other reviews
where<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.170> true<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.970> don't<00:02:20.209> want<00:02:20.360> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
where that is true and I don't want to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.880 
where that is true and I don't want to
buy<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.870> thousand-dollar<00:02:21.349> computer

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
buy it like a thousand-dollar computer

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.130 
buy it like a thousand-dollar computer
because<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:22.909> my<00:02:23.030> first<00:02:23.060> mac<00:02:23.540> it's

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
because this is my first mac it's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.800 
because this is my first mac it's
expensive<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:26.239> don't<00:02:26.420> want<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.780> like

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
expensive and I don't want it to like

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.899 
expensive and I don't want it to like

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
to mention about the macbook is it has

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.509 
to mention about the macbook is it has
this<00:02:46.909> like<00:02:47.120> really<00:02:47.359> nice<00:02:48.079> bottom<00:02:48.530> that's<00:02:49.310> like

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
this like really nice bottom that's like

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.339 
this like really nice bottom that's like
screwed<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.599> can't<00:02:50.840> access<00:02:51.049> the

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
screwed in so you can't access the

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.680 
screwed in so you can't access the
battery<00:02:51.470> but<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:52.579> like<00:02:52.819> non-skid<00:02:53.450> surface

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
battery but it's like non-skid surface

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.720 
battery but it's like non-skid surface
it's<00:02:54.079> not<00:02:54.230> really<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.709> guess<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.430> feels<00:02:55.609> a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
it's not really I guess it feels a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
it's not really I guess it feels a
little<00:02:55.849> like<00:02:56.030> rubber<00:02:56.329> but<00:02:56.480> I'm<00:02:56.569> not<00:02:56.720> sure

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
little like rubber but I'm not sure

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.869 
little like rubber but I'm not sure
that's<00:02:57.049> really<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> rubber<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:58.549> one<00:02:58.700> problem

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
that's really a rubber the one problem

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.869 
that's really a rubber the one problem
is<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.690> it<00:03:00.680> gets<00:03:00.889> dirty<00:03:01.159> in<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.489> corners

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
is that it gets dirty in the corners

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.729 
is that it gets dirty in the corners
where<00:03:02.150> rest<00:03:02.389> on<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.690> table<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.620> that's

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
where rest on the table so that's

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.280 
where rest on the table so that's
another<00:03:04.010> problem
