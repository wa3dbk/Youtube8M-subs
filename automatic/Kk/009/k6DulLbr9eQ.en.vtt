00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.580 
going to have to complete to get it gold
or<00:01:32.280> diamond<00:01:32.790> camo<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.659> future<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
or diamond camo in the future so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.569 
or diamond camo in the future so
basically<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.040> you're<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> do

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
basically what you're gonna have to do

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.240 
basically what you're gonna have to do
to<00:01:35.759> start<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.210> gotta<00:01:36.420> destroy<00:01:36.840> 10<00:01:37.170> 20<00:01:37.619> 30<00:01:37.860> 40

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
to start you gotta destroy 10 20 30 40

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.319 
to start you gotta destroy 10 20 30 40
50<00:01:38.579> 60<00:01:39.150> 75<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.990> 100<00:01:40.470> aircraft<00:01:40.670> finally<00:01:41.670> that's

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
50 60 75 and 100 aircraft finally that's

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.030 
50 60 75 and 100 aircraft finally that's
really<00:01:42.720> easy<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.409> ground<00:01:43.649> war<00:01:43.829> III

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
really easy just go into ground war III

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
really easy just go into ground war III
destroyed<00:01:44.640> 20<00:01:44.970> aircraft<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.689> game

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
destroyed 20 aircraft in one game

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.830 
destroyed 20 aircraft in one game
because<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> enemy<00:01:46.890> team<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.399> good<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.840> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
because the enemy team was good and it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
because the enemy team was good and it
is<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.560> basically<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> best<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> get

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
is that's basically the best way to get

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
is that's basically the best way to get
a<00:01:50.700> ground<00:01:50.970> war<00:01:51.210> i<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:52.229> there's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
a ground war i think because there's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.600 
a ground war i think because there's
just<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.920> many<00:01:53.040> people<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.520> many

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
just so many people and so many

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
just so many people and so many
opportunities<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> call<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.930> UAVs

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
opportunities for them to call on UAVs

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.499 
opportunities for them to call on UAVs
and<00:01:55.439> i'll<00:01:56.369> get<00:01:56.549> into<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.820> class<00:01:57.030> setup<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and i'll get into my class setup so that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.690 
and i'll get into my class setup so that
you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.869> most<00:01:58.110> effectively<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.920> those<00:01:59.130> UAV

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you can most effectively get those UAV

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.359 
you can most effectively get those UAV
kills<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.360> only<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:01.020> shot<00:02:01.369> in

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
kills because you only have one shot in

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
kills because you only have one shot in
your<00:02:02.640> small<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.180> i'll<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.719> talking<00:02:03.840> about

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
your small and i'll be talking about

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
your small and i'll be talking about
that<00:02:04.140> later<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:04.680> i<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:05.009> into<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.250> class

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that later when i get into my class

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370 
that later when i get into my class
setup<00:02:05.820> anyway<00:02:06.540> after<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.810> you're<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
setup anyway after that you're going to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.499 
setup anyway after that you're going to
have<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> series<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> five<00:02:08.910> challenges

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
have to do a series of five challenges

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.839 
have to do a series of five challenges
the<00:02:09.869> first<00:02:10.110> being<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.530> 10<00:02:10.739> impact<00:02:11.190> kills<00:02:11.520> with

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the first being get 10 impact kills with

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.180 
the first being get 10 impact kills with
the<00:02:12.060> small<00:02:12.420> itself<00:02:12.900> now<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.770> really<00:02:13.950> easy

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the small itself now it's really easy

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.250 
the small itself now it's really easy
it's<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.640> hot<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.060> sounds<00:02:15.360> trust<00:02:15.660> me<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
it's not as hot as it sounds trust me is

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.660 
it's not as hot as it sounds trust me is
all<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.680> do<00:02:16.770> free<00:02:17.129> for<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.430> works

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
all you have to do free for all works

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.330 
all you have to do free for all works
best<00:02:18.140> that's<00:02:19.140> always<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.650> best<00:02:19.770> i<00:02:19.980> believe

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
best that's always the best i believe

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.339 
best that's always the best i believe
for<00:02:20.550> getting<00:02:21.060> these<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.360> direct<00:02:21.629> impact<00:02:21.959> so

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
for getting these like direct impact so

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.320 
for getting these like direct impact so
you<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.770> go<00:02:22.980> up<00:02:23.010> somebody<00:02:23.670> flash<00:02:24.060> them

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
you have to do go up somebody flash them

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.559 
you have to do go up somebody flash them
and<00:02:24.569> then<00:02:25.530> go<00:02:26.129> right<00:02:26.489> up<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.670> them<00:02:26.879> aim<00:02:27.270> down

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
and then go right up to them aim down

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.390 
and then go right up to them aim down
sights<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:28.170> sure<00:02:28.440> you're<00:02:28.590> lined<00:02:28.739> up<00:02:28.950> perfect

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
sights make sure you're lined up perfect

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.970 
sights make sure you're lined up perfect
and<00:02:29.520> bam<00:02:30.180> direct<00:02:30.750> impact<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:31.349> simple<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and bam direct impact as simple as that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.250 
and bam direct impact as simple as that
and<00:02:32.370> i<00:02:33.150> actually<00:02:33.300> directing<00:02:33.810> back<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.110> guy

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and i actually directing back that guy

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.339 
and i actually directing back that guy
right<00:02:34.440> there<00:02:34.500> see<00:02:35.459> how<00:02:36.209> simple<00:02:36.269> is<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.720> well

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
right there see how simple is that well

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.720 
right there see how simple is that well
anyway<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.980> next<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.340> you're<00:02:38.400> going<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.610> have

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
anyway the next one you're going to have

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.339 
anyway the next one you're going to have
to<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.239> destroy<00:02:39.510> five<00:02:39.750> aircraft<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
to do is to destroy five aircraft in a

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.110 
to do is to destroy five aircraft in a
single<00:02:40.650> game<00:02:40.800> one<00:02:41.370> time<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.849> small

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
single game one time with the small

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.809 
single game one time with the small
that's<00:02:42.390> also<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:43.080> easy<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:44.340> easier<00:02:44.700> than

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
that's also very easy it's easier than

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.030 
that's also very easy it's easier than
it<00:02:44.970> sounds<00:02:45.319> unless<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.470> think<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.769> sounds

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
it sounds unless you think it sounds

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.280 
it sounds unless you think it sounds
hard<00:02:47.250> which<00:02:47.550> which<00:02:48.060> cases<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.140> easy

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
hard which which cases it's really easy

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.229 
hard which which cases it's really easy
anyway<00:02:49.980> go<00:02:50.190> into<00:02:50.370> ground<00:02:50.610> war<00:02:50.849> if<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.060> works

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
anyway go into ground war if that works

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479 
anyway go into ground war if that works
best<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.980> there's<00:02:52.980> going<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.220> so

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
best for this there's going to be so

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.710 
best for this there's going to be so
many<00:02:53.610> people<00:02:53.700> calling<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.330> UAVs<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
many people calling in the UAVs and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.320 
many people calling in the UAVs and
counter<00:02:55.170> UAVs<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.590> care<00:02:56.010> packages<00:02:56.580> those<00:02:57.120> are

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
counter UAVs and care packages those are

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.420 
counter UAVs and care packages those are
really<00:02:57.569> easy<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.959> shoot<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.680> you're

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
really easy to shoot down and you're

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.610 
really easy to shoot down and you're
going<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.580> want<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.090> running<00:03:00.330> c4<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.140> semtex

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
going to want to be running c4 or semtex

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.899 
going to want to be running c4 or semtex
to<00:03:01.709> kill<00:03:01.920> yourself<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.430> after<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.730> get

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
to kill yourself right after you get

double<00:04:37.330> kill<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.870> that's<00:04:38.020> going<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.349> help<00:04:38.410> you

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
double kill so that's going to help you

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.409 
double kill so that's going to help you
out<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:39.010> then<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> last<00:04:39.729> challenge<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.270> to

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
out and then the last challenge is to

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.480 
out and then the last challenge is to
destroy<00:04:40.660> one<00:04:40.990> dragon<00:04:41.650> fire<00:04:41.830> with<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.220> small

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
destroy one dragon fire with the small

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.850 
destroy one dragon fire with the small
that's<00:04:43.419> not<00:04:43.720> as<00:04:43.900> hard<00:04:44.199> as<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.380> sounds<00:04:44.650> you

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
that's not as hard as it sounds you

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.250 
that's not as hard as it sounds you
basically<00:04:45.250> domination<00:04:46.150> or<00:04:46.330> ground<00:04:46.870> war<00:04:47.110> works

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
basically domination or ground war works

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.390 
basically domination or ground war works
the<00:04:47.380> best<00:04:47.500> for<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:47.800> because<00:04:47.919> there's<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.250> lot

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
the best for this because there's a lot

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.719 
the best for this because there's a lot
of<00:04:48.430> people<00:04:48.729> running<00:04:48.910> kill<00:04:49.539> streaks<00:04:49.810> like<00:04:49.870> this

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
of people running kill streaks like this

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.670 
of people running kill streaks like this
you<00:04:51.729> basically<00:04:52.060> it's<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.599> luck<00:04:53.020> thing<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.530> got

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680

to wait for somebody to be running it I

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.689 
to wait for somebody to be running it I
joined<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.169> session<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.560> progress<00:04:56.620> on<00:04:57.250> I

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
set up the class setup that I'll get

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.050 
set up the class setup that I'll get
into<00:05:11.590> today<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.010> perkone<00:05:12.490> either<00:05:12.760> white

weight or scavenger whichever one and

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.260 
weight or scavenger whichever one and
whichever<00:05:15.250> challenge<00:05:15.729> like<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.060> said<00:05:16.240> earlier

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
whichever challenge like I said earlier

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.700 
whichever challenge like I said earlier
you're<00:05:16.750> going<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.930> be<00:05:17.020> wanting<00:05:17.349> to<00:05:17.560> run

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
you're going to be wanting to run

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.710 
you're going to be wanting to run
scavenger<00:05:18.280> for<00:05:18.550> those<00:05:18.669> double<00:05:19.180> kills<00:05:19.449> and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
scavenger for those double kills and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.390 
scavenger for those double kills and
then<00:05:20.110> I'd<00:05:20.229> run<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.470> lightweight<00:05:20.830> all<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.190> rest

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
then I'd run a lightweight all the rest

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.270 
then I'd run a lightweight all the rest
of<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.580> time<00:05:21.760> park<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.449> I<00:05:22.510> run<00:05:22.810> toughness<00:05:23.380> just

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
of the time park to I run toughness just

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.800 
of the time park to I run toughness just
because<00:05:24.639> that's<00:05:25.030> going<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.330> reduce<00:05:25.479> the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
because that's going to reduce the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.930 
because that's going to reduce the
flinch<00:05:26.080> when<00:05:26.169> you're<00:05:26.440> hit<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:27.639> have<00:05:27.820> to

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
flinch when you're hit and you have to

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.339 
flinch when you're hit and you have to
aim<00:05:28.060> down<00:05:28.180> sights<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.630> shoot<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:28.960> weapon

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
aim down sights to shoot this weapon

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:29.930 
aim down sights to shoot this weapon
after<00:05:29.530> it

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
after it

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.320 
after it
so<00:05:31.130> that's<00:05:32.130> going<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.370> help<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.640> out<00:05:32.700> reduce

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
so that's going to help you out reduce

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.570 
so that's going to help you out reduce
flinch<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.900> get<00:05:34.470> those<00:05:34.620> longer<00:05:35.010> range<00:05:35.250> kills

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
flinch and get those longer range kills

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.600 
flinch and get those longer range kills
then<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> last<00:05:36.420> one<00:05:36.630> is<00:05:36.990> perk<00:05:37.650> 3<00:05:37.950> dexterity

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
then the last one is perk 3 dexterity

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.850 
then the last one is perk 3 dexterity
