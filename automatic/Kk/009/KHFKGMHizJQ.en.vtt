 today's player who adrian this 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.460
 free square player that has a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.620
 potential of 87 now I will show you 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.679
 etc 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.569
 adriano let's look for him for a team 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.940
 like leverton that hasn't beaten 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.949
 very high 9 million and 500 but adrian 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.809
 this value of his 5 card 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.850
 million so we can safely 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.889
 take it even if I do it now 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.929
 see how to take it even at a price 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.569
 the lower it is worth it I assure you 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.100
 I was advised by a user 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.589
 kept telling me from the take from you 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.829
 pediatricians will satisfy you by drawing adherent 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.740
 I show it and reviewed 3 million 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.240
 the more gibson the flamengo accepts we finish 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.719
 deprives the contract from adrian asking 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.020
 9 million for 4 years for a team of 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.359
 average ranking is a figure of replies 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.240
 more than acceptable 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.280
 here the contract is shown e 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.960
 you will see that he accepts sings say win 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.430
 as soon as transferred as well i like where 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.560
 I live here and there of the usual boys 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.430
 which the players say they make you 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.570
 pissing off 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 I'll show you a little bit about it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.030
 field to see some of his skills 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.850
 I say that his fault has only one 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.549
 the door who says mortar a vision of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.369
 awesome game always assisted 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.649
 right and miss also look here succeeds 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.920
 to take the ball but then to force 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.479
 physics sin its you just have to search 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.549
 to avoid physical contact with him 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.909
 also learn here how to free yourself 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.569
 spectacular agility throw goal 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.219
 lots of goals scored goal avalanches 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.600
 I told myself that you only have to avoid the 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.729
 physical contact when you look at them 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.020
 insertions that insertions that makes 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.659
 you have to do is avoid physical contact 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.280
 because he tells you how quickly he flies into 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.369
 earth look at the skills is the sum 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.400
 enabled eating 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.629
 the tricks because even the shooting from 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.420
 long distance 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:22.150
 look at 55 44 5- star roads that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.769
 they are really many 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.459
 for a player who is then 19 years old me 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.930
 it seems and becomes 86 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.810
 look at how the ball juggles 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.900
 and keep it in the field then still kiss 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.849
 kiss frees the opponent easily 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.470
 with another fake still in front of the 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.959
 goalkeeper always manages to be alone 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 in front of the goalkeeper and shoves it 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.329
 once again this young boy 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.750
 still there is an awesome stuff 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.970
 how do you get rid of throw back like 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.180
 I said physically just a player 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.849
 it's up to him flies on the ground that is one 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.599
 flaw is why in my opinion yes 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.459
 deserves a 7 May good children steps forward 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.230
 7 hello to the prof 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.879
 ah I forgot about the player who 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.489
 you want to recent ska for the next one 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.200
 time and I will try to accommodate the 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.200
 player themes that you want their science
