00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.830
 gentlemen welcome a few weeks ago 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 I made a video with this sentence is a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.860
 terna panel that is placed well 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.320
 easy 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.250
 following the cable we put it in the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.210
 back in our connector 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.519
 air antenna etc 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.630
 well that working connects 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.300
 directly 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.740
 and it puts more we have enough our 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.539
 scheduled television 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.310
 tsonga not some channels that are seen in 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.260
 mexico the antenna is there 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.950
 now then they put it in a place 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.770
 in the back in a hidden place 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.230
 so it does not look ok 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 well we have some channels that look 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 here in Mexico we are there in 27.3 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 27.2 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.090
 of 27.1 as there are several there are good many 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.070
 channels is antenna is for places 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.689
 with good reception this 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.659
 because we are inside the house 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.149
 if they want and have good rest if 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.670
 have some problem reception 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.200
 they are in front of nothing outside in escalante in 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.180
 inside 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.329
 an antenna panel that is placed by the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.710
 ok easy then the good test I'll 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.900
 to pass some I will remove by the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.380
 commercial but that's 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.470
 can see the channels in hd that does not have 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.480
 what to do now because they will take away the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.910
 analog channels and in this area 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.200
 of those channels and your strength needs 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.680
 sound at the stop to watch television 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.750

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.320

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.430
