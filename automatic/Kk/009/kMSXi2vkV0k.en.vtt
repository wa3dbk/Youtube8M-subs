 Hey, people, good beauty here is the bid.

 I'll show you now how many 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.389
 species thousand day care centers 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.310
 some people were asking me 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.830
 if it actually rotates this frame rate 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 that the site will be the ones who did tests and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.769
 needed to be and of plates and 680 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.669
 to learn coffee 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:43.079
 good I do not know what they used but 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:49.520
 See 32 species here as you can. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 view is in 1920 by 1080 pixels x the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:12.190
 maximum texture and specification 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:14.620
 charts at most also true 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.800
 I took a phase that she has a lot 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.540
 action then I'll show you how 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.530
 this border game 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.530
 I see the game 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:16.500
 O 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:20.520
 o the overall average of fps is 30 in some 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.980
 parties going to 40 and without staff always well 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.690
 played or played for me is super 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.880
 calmly play with this 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.880
 a technician with 60 and 70 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:42.020
 who else has this waiting card that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.310
 you can also comment because 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.310
 speaking ill is unique 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.980
 with this the areas of combatant and action 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 to show rosetta 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.640
 the rally 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.049
 can you see if it's quiet 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.439
 now comes the beast that I do not like 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.439
 stay in law 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.050
 O 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.470
 good, easy as replying 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.990
 a little further on the team than 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.660
 in the next stages but are more open 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.190
 and you can have more or less a sense of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.190
 graphical capability of this port 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.950
 a good part of the game had no problems 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.950
 locking and slowness in no phase 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.310
 with the forest closed 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.879
 I'll pass right here because I want to 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.879
 raise the door 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.189
 uai 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.639
 in a hotel mall 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.950
 this is 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 ae 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:23.030
 That's it, obviously. Well, sometimes. 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.030
 often goes to 40 feet 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.539
 no problems 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:40.589
 I just hope I got questions. 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.589
 in the kingdom 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.160
 the lion subscribes to the online channel and 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.960
 shown in the video 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.919
