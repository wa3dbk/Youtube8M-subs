good for games like Street Fighter and I
thought<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.550> would<00:04:31.670> be<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.260> much<00:04:33.260> better

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
thought it would be a much better

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.450 
thought it would be a much better
improvement<00:04:34.550> over<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.060> regular<00:04:35.690> pot<00:04:35.930> but

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
improvement over the regular pot but

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.670 
improvement over the regular pot but
yeah<00:04:37.460> if<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:37.910> find<00:04:38.120> one<00:04:38.180> cheap<00:04:38.480> pickup

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.540 

identical<00:04:42.680> at<00:04:42.740> these<00:04:42.950> things<00:04:43.190> anyway<00:04:43.520> so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
identical at these things anyway so

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.670 
identical at these things anyway so
whether<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.480> user<00:04:44.660> or<00:04:44.810> not<00:04:44.960> doesn't<00:04:45.170> mean<00:04:45.410> very

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
whether a user or not doesn't mean very

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.120 
whether a user or not doesn't mean very
much<00:04:45.890> difference<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.430> me<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:47.360> but<00:04:47.810> yeah<00:04:48.170> so

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
much difference to me and but yeah so
