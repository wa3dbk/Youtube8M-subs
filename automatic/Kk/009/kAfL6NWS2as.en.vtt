00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.420
 whiskey de meeting point fine spirits 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.820
 Welcome to the whiskey store 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
 the meeting place of fine spirits and today 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.940
 I have a Canadian whiskey 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.029
 brought along yes there are not so many 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.460
 by a black velvet surf with 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.230
 eight years old the normal black 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 I have velvet without age 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 already tried here and stood 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.330
 just like this bottle from the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.420
 The province of Alberta is on the eastern edge of the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.300
 rocky mountains expired bridge yes da am 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 border of the large cereal fields with yes 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 the fresh water of the rocky mountains 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 is wonderfully whiskey 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 produce a very big style 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 there you are now on one side 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.879
 a very light industrial whiskey 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.489
 usually yes or wheat depending on 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.690
 and since it's a blended whiskey 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.829
 you have to act now this whole 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.210
 light soft whiskey still on 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.039
 brew a little spice 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 and for that you have a room whiskey 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:11.400
 burned and that gives then yes yes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:15.200
 this unmistakable but not this 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.210
 eight-year-old Canadian whiskey aroma 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.009
 matured now much longer than the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.689
 without age, typically like that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.430
 around the 3 i do not know how that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.020
 Canadian law two dictates how 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.680
 the americans over 3 over the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
 europeans 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.369
 i dont know what he where two or three 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.070
 years should have the normal and the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.590
 night should be much more around 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.780
 the old one i just got the video ago 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.090
 again extra looked at that was so yes 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 very nice and pleasant in the nose 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 very caramel yes also a bit oily 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.979
 and patrick very soft and then im 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.600
 taste real shot with rye 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.350
 strong on the tongue and expect that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.490
 I now that this is something 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.020
 that harmonizes that means that that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.540
 aroma as the oak barrels a bit 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
 becomes stronger and more complex and the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.390
 Rock'n coming not so has come through 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.020
 I do not know 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.900
 whiskey softer older nobody knows 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.810
 so few of these whiskys also rock 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.550
 Here again, a giant bottle of lattice 40 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:30.510
 volume percentage and is still something here 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:36.170
 soft on it I was white in luxurious with 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:40.560
 soft luxury this premium city whiskey 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.970
 with for its outgoing taste and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.970
 it will be celebrated on mild character 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.510
 only research barrels selected yes what 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.320
 always that is through the master distiller 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.120
 and at least eight years was available 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.209
 Now back on what have they? 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.630
 by the law or whiskey said at least 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.130
 egoism younga whiskey to achieve 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.110
 unicast that is the mission of age 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.610
 eight year old with boy around one 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.810
 to get harmonious taste where 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.680
 I'm the wrong concept 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.160
 that can not be he is soft and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:29.519
 distinct for every occasion yes 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.260
 the main thing is selling and closing yes 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.660
 enjoy doing that responsibly 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:45.690
 we still do not know much about us 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:48.530
 But try good screw cap 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.530
 neat seal 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.810
 This whiskey is in our shop system 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.790
 about the taste rating already 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:07.400
 has been evaluated and let's say 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:09.980
 mixed so have not been rated 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.560
 bad not good not not spicy 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.200
 which is not so anywhere so ratti 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.560
 with taste and so on 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.540
 over the middle but the lowest 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.620
 Ranks are judged by taste 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.120
 slipped back into the middle so me 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 I do not really like that now 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.360
 great revelation of topics yes it 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.729
 Agree to be able to measure more accurately 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.200
 your own taste really is 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.200
 influence such a bias 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:54.189
 So here is more than this caramel 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.349
 additionally vanilla red and the same 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.999
 really more the caramel vanilla note 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:03.550
 is pressed into the background 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:05.999
 and over there is already the eyes 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.999
 to feel 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:21.690
 it comes so very tender breath 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:25.139
 apply so I would not now so 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:33.570
 to see one-dimensional like the old one as well 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:35.250
 the boy without age now ever 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.210
 longer you smell us more disappears 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.370
 the more he sits down 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.789
 cardigan basic character of the blackberry 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.789
 by 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:08.890
 So first nicola area and then 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.290
 the robben comes out in front now 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.720
 dribble at the top stops slowly 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.530
 to the center but moves 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.430
 surprisingly not really 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.830
 bitter strikes and this what I in 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.390
 when the young blackwell is called 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.970
 Brausepulver also called that 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.720
 is to some extent recognizable here 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:31.510
 However, significantly more rich clearly 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.590
 more barrel and hope puts one 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:38.770
 he is not a counterpoint so young 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.660
 really but really old is too 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.360
 not because the dues starts now 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:51.220
 already to fade and it stays more 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:52.420
 from the brocken as from the oak stuff that 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.840
 coming light ford note yet 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.840
 after 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:10.650
 so well how bad things more complex than 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.210
 those without but old disclosure is still a 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.680
 good piece away from me the 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.960
 would find a really great 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.180
 that's a decent solid made 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.280
 Canadian whiskey not so that 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.140
 footnote has like many others 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.150
 Have Canadian whiskeys 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.360
 there is a bit of a counterpoint 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.470
 with a decent rock freight, yes 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.760
 a shop system according to it gives them 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.770
 Often there is them and now and then 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.590
 are they not the replenishment of canada 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.280
 is not quite as constant as we are 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.960
 to imagine that 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.960
 Thank you very much for harm
