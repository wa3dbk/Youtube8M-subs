impact I cleaned all the old grease out
and<00:03:44.390> I've<00:03:44.930> cleaned<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.500> bearings<00:03:45.890> I'm<00:03:46.130> going

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
and I've cleaned the bearings I'm going

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.229 
and I've cleaned the bearings I'm going
to<00:03:46.400> regress<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:48.020> bearings<00:03:48.849> make<00:03:49.849> sure<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:50.120> got

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
to regress the bearings make sure we got

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.880 
to regress the bearings make sure we got
plenty<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.599> grease<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:50.840> here<00:03:51.050> we<00:03:51.650> greased

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
plenty of grease in here we greased

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.390 
plenty of grease in here we greased
everything<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:53.110> then<00:03:54.110> we<00:03:54.319> will<00:03:54.530> get<00:03:55.099> it<00:03:55.220> put

and<00:04:04.700> put<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:05.269> where<00:04:05.750> your<00:04:06.100> seal<00:04:07.100> goes<00:04:07.430> that

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
and put here where your seal goes that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.520 
and put here where your seal goes that
way<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.180> already<00:04:08.780> have<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.200> little

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
way you already have a little

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
going to be so your seals not running on

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:25.070 
going to be so your seals not running on
dried<00:04:13.970> metal
