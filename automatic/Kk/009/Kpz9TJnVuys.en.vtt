 that you want I give you that option and nothing 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 let's go see the rules that you have 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.239
 that having this hybrid should contain the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.789
 next players this is mandatory 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.559
 are these three beasts of my 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.760
 bronze teams you know them cannes 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 oil korean kanji of ms ibini isei 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 and the Australian and beanie beast a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.870
 authentic crack and nothing as the team 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.000
 to make it a bit 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.180
 more complicated has to contain 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 these three players plus more rules 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.710
 good hybrid rules that I'm going to 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.050
 Allow me to send you a template 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.580
 per participant so think about it well and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.930
 what you do is going to be the definitive one 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.700
 I will allow changes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.470
 in the team in the template is accepted 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 any training you can use the one 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 you want the one you like the most in which 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.940
 more in which you best fit in the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.300
 equipment changes of position are accepted 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.130
 the players but no abrupt changes is 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.880
 say you can put there bin and instead of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 cdmc or playmaker but do not put him 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.570
 of mediocentro those penalize at the time 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 to make the decision of who is the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.310
 winner is worth and good as I said before 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.520
 it's going to be solely and exclusively 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.670
 Bronze players are worth the rules for 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.500
 sending the equipment this is very 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.290
 important I'm also just going to accept 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 the teams the templates through 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
 of a private message on YouTube and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.420
 twitter nipones that you try to send me 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.179
 what's out there, I'm not going to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 accept and then it's very important 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.739
 also that you follow this format of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.810
 named it so that later it will be more 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.600
 easy to organize all the equipment to the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.239
 time to choose a winner when you 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.730
 ask for the name of the template in food 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.720
 get high see the box the name your 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.880
 squad you are going to give it this straight name 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.240
 your name on your YouTube 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.820
 user and the other script and the console 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.060
 for which you want the coins and you have 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.270
 the two consoles because you put one of them 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.280
 which you want 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.540
 you save the equipment you do it and it's very 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.000
 important that you go up to the right 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.480
 The save button is valid for you to give the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.550
 good link that is kept in toy in 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.680
 your database and already up appears 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.290
 the link that you have to go through 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240
 direct message on youtube in the subject 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.770
 You put exactly what you have 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.740
 arranged in the name of the template 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.290
 challenge script your name on youtube a 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.990
 script and your console and in the message 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.720
 I put me the link you that you can paste 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.190
 to be able to take a screenshot of the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.220
 team that what you want but always 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.100
 that everything looks good, I prefer 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.380
 that you put the link to fuguet but good 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.390
 whatever you want the deadline to 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.070
 participate will be until Friday 14 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.810
 at 12 o'clock at night from that 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.120
 I will not accept more templates 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.819
 you have a week I think there's 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.719
 enough time to create the team 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.700
 and well what is going to look for him in the 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.950
 time to choose the winner is that the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.349
 team have a good rapport if 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.200
 the maximum is possible but if not 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.650
 get close enough and be players 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.569
 of quality is to say that you do not put me a 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.989
 bronze from medium to 45 are worth 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.670
 solid players and good to the end and to the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.739
 that is a template that 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.400
 template completes one more template or 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.459
 less original and solid is worth any 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.930
 doubt that you have in my twitter tutelas 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.400
 to ask me what you want, do not 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.169
 you send the teams out there I tell you 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.409
 because I will not accept just by message 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:16.680
 private from youtube and with that format and 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.970
 nothing to say too good in the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.250
 remote case that occurs 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.410
 ties for example that I know that 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.270
 I choose a template and that template 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.100
 it is sent by two people exactly the same 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.010
 with the same players training and 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.140
 all good then I'll simply choose 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.700
 because whoever has me who has 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.420
 sent the template before it is worth as a 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.600
 way of deciding this is very remote but 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.690
 good to tell you that in the case that 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.730
 I'll decide that way and nothing else 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.470
 I think I said everything and again give 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.020
 thanks to carlos and neymar is worth 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.350
 offer to give the coins nothing 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.270
 good luck with the contest you have a 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.860
 week to create the teams - you can 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.140
 go sending them by private message of 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.120
 youtube only one template per 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.340
 participant and nothing but a lot of luck 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.340
 guys and see you later
