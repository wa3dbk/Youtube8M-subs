00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello everybody today it 's a video I quickly 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.540
 I just want to show you both here in two 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.049
 transparent books that I wanted 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 know which one to seap to discover 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.770
 which of these two links is the water I 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.619
 I will use a magic wand and me I 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:34.950
 I'll pay my lights or make 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:39.610
 first test with the bottle on the right and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:44.050
 now with my left failure 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:48.130
 observe the result of how the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.890
 result of this liquid in the light I place 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.970
 the two next to each other 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.820
 notice that the light passes through the bottle 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.730
 from the right and on arriving in a 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 left it changes color 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 if I do the opposite happens 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.240
 I'll now use a lamp one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.539
 a little stronger though 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.500
 that happens with the two registers with 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.700
 liquid 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.579
 so in this beckham I put water 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:37.619
 tonic in this other beque here I 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.720
 I put the common water but what 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.929
 happened here staff is that water 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.789
 tonic that I used this experience 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.189
 she has a substance called neno 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.830
 that is fluorescent that means 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.849
 when it receives a wave spectrum 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.819
 not visible in the case here of the black light 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.159
 it will turn this light into the spectrum 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.159
 not visible in a light in the spectrum 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.200
 visible if you want to understand a little 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.659
 more about fluorescence watch the video 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 I 'll leave it at the link below. 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.140
 in the channel if this curious one that he explains 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 with details the essence flower phenomenon 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.560
 but how will it be the water ice 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.540
 tonic of this trays part of ice with 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.709
 tonic water in part of ice with water 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.130
 normal notes that now against violet 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.220
 part of the ice is flourishing and another 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.200
 party is not flourishing 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.250
 now I'll put fluorescent ice 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.250
 into the water 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.210
 Look who's on the site. 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:09.190
 chose the flower, that's it folks 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.160
