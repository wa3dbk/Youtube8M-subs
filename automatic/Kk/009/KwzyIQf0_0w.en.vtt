one<00:02:56.170> thing<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.620> say<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.160> felt<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
one thing I can say is I felt like the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940 
one thing I can say is I felt like the
hair<00:02:57.910> was<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> little<00:02:58.239> thin<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.049> I<00:02:59.440> think<00:02:59.799> it's

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
hair was a little thin but I think it's

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.500 
hair was a little thin but I think it's
more<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.220> because<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.730> was<00:03:00.760> used<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.269> getting

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
more so because I was used to getting

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.420 
more so because I was used to getting
Indian<00:03:02.019> hair<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.320> that's<00:03:02.410> way<00:03:02.739> thicker

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
Indian hair and that's way thicker

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.520 
Indian hair and that's way thicker
this<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.880> Brazilian<00:03:04.390> hair<00:03:04.870> surprisingly

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
this is Brazilian hair surprisingly

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.289 
this is Brazilian hair surprisingly
enough<00:03:05.650> I've<00:03:05.950> never<00:03:06.220> had<00:03:06.430> Brazilian<00:03:07.060> before

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
enough I've never had Brazilian before

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.570 
enough I've never had Brazilian before
but<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.049> resilient<00:03:08.620> here<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.130> it's<00:03:09.459> a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
but this is resilient here and it's a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.090 
but this is resilient here and it's a
little<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.049> body<00:03:11.260> wave<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.830> I<00:03:11.920> never

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
little and it's a body wave but I never

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.259
