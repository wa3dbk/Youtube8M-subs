00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
so we have different levels I mean

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.810 
so we have different levels I mean
there's<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.690> few<00:01:52.900> levels<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.410> are<00:01:53.760> that<00:01:54.760> are

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
there's a few levels that are that are

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.400 
there's a few levels that are that are
different<00:01:55.210> from<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.630> others<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.290> were

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
different from the others that were

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.960 
different from the others that were
designed<00:01:56.590> differently<00:01:57.040> but<00:01:57.610> pretty<00:01:57.910> much

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
designed differently but pretty much

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.740 
designed differently but pretty much
they<00:01:58.420> are<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.960> same<00:01:59.170> so<00:02:00.420> can't<00:02:01.420> make<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.660> up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
they are the same so can't make it up

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.860 
they are the same so can't make it up
