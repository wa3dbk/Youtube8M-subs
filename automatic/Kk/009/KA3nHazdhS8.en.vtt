on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> freeway<00:01:18.920> barely<00:01:19.920> feel<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> engine

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
on the freeway barely feel the engine

on the freeway barely feel the engine
running<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> mean<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.780> feels<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.170> touring

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
bike it has a kind of cool man u Matic I
guess<00:01:26.369> you'd<00:01:26.549> call<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.790> transmission<00:01:27.540> which

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
guess you'd call it transmission which

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
guess you'd call it transmission which
is<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> manual<00:01:28.680> transmission

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is like a manual transmission

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
is like a manual transmission
push-button<00:01:29.970> shifter<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.049> be

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
push-button shifter but they can also be

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
push-button shifter but they can also be
automatic<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.340> only<00:01:32.520> side<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> it's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
automatic the only side to that is it's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
automatic the only side to that is it's
cool<00:01:33.960> when<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.560> manual<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.310> most<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
cool when it's in manual but most of the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
cool when it's in manual but most of the
time<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> don't<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.750> manual<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
time you don't want it in manual and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
time you don't want it in manual and
when<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.189> manual<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.210> clutch<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
when it's not in manual the clutch is

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.630 
when it's not in manual the clutch is
constantly<00:01:40.229> slipping<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> can't<00:01:41.280> find<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
constantly slipping and it can't find a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.780 
constantly slipping and it can't find a
gear<00:01:42.000> awesome<00:01:42.509> motor<00:01:43.070> horrible<00:01:44.070> CVT

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
gear awesome motor horrible CVT

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.389 
gear awesome motor horrible CVT
transmission<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.750> slips<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:47.070> always

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
transmission it slips it's always

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
transmission it slips it's always
hunting<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.270> gas<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> revs<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.680> moon<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
hunting you gas it it revs the moon and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.179 
hunting you gas it it revs the moon and
then<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> starts<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> move<00:01:50.850> roller<00:01:51.840> weights

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
then it starts to move roller weights

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
then it starts to move roller weights
need<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.399> weight<00:01:53.610> he<00:01:53.820> stood<00:01:54.329> lockup<00:01:54.840> faster

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
need more weight he stood lockup faster

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
need more weight he stood lockup faster
I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.670> clutch<00:01:56.850> work<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I think with a little clutch work that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.569 
I think with a little clutch work that
thing<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.899> been<00:01:57.930> top<00:01:58.290> dog<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:59.399> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
thing could have been top dog this is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.959 
thing could have been top dog this is
Suki<00:01:59.850> Bergman<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:01.399> probably<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> was

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
Suki Bergman was probably the one I was

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340 
Suki Bergman was probably the one I was
most<00:02:03.060> excited<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.540> ride<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.899> look<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
most excited to ride and look like it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.569 
most excited to ride and look like it
was<00:02:04.500> gonna<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> most<00:02:05.040> comfortable<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
was gonna be the most comfortable and

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.460 
was gonna be the most comfortable and
maybe<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
maybe I

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.440 
maybe I
the<00:02:06.590> most<00:02:07.130> amenities<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.790> all<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.000> bikes<00:02:08.210> on

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the most amenities of all the bikes on

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
the most amenities of all the bikes on
it<00:02:08.600> which<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.290> definitely<00:02:09.619> did<00:02:09.800> they<00:02:09.979> had<00:02:10.130> a

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
it which it definitely did they had a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.040 
it which it definitely did they had a
moving<00:02:10.520> windshield<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.450> you've<00:02:11.600> got<00:02:11.780> Mears

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
moving windshield and you've got Mears

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.500 
moving windshield and you've got Mears
and<00:02:12.140> now<00:02:12.950> you've<00:02:13.520> got<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.730> power<00:02:13.940> button<00:02:14.090> I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
and now you've got a power button I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.850 
and now you've got a power button I
guess<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.810> gives<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.050> more<00:02:15.080> power<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.500> couldn't

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
guess it gives it more power I couldn't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.560 
guess it gives it more power I couldn't
really<00:02:15.950> feel<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.700> difference<00:02:16.730> too<00:02:17.120> much<00:02:17.300> but

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
really feel the difference too much but

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.060 
really feel the difference too much but
there's<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.870> button<00:02:18.050> says<00:02:18.290> power<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.860> was

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
there's a button says power so I was

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.020 
there's a button says power so I was
always<00:02:19.220> hitting<00:02:19.430> because<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.700> wanted<00:02:19.880> more

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
always hitting because I wanted more

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.850 
always hitting because I wanted more
power<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.450> was<00:02:20.660> happy<00:02:20.930> with<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.230> actual<00:02:21.650> top

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
power I was happy with the actual top

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.980 
power I was happy with the actual top
and<00:02:22.100> power<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.390> handling<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:23.870> the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
tough I can definitely see it being a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490 
tough I can definitely see it being a
really<00:02:43.640> great<00:02:43.910> commuting<00:02:44.480> scooter<00:02:44.870> but<00:02:45.200> for

tight<00:02:48.590> cornering<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.940> definitely<00:02:50.330> didn't

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
tight cornering it definitely didn't

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.060 
tight cornering it definitely didn't
conform<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.140> same<00:02:51.500> extent<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:51.890> the
