00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.810 

yeah<00:00:00.960> what's<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.530> on<00:00:01.560> guys<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.280> exotics

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
yeah what's going on guys this exotics

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.180 
yeah what's going on guys this exotics
and<00:00:02.939> tenanted<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.480> owed<00:00:04.080> one<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.859> random

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
and tenanted is owed one of the random

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.579 
and tenanted is owed one of the random
chemistry<00:00:05.940> class<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.960> with<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.350> newest

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
chemistry class so with the newest

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.169 
chemistry class so with the newest
update<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.069> called<00:00:08.250> latigo<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.849> actually

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
update and called latigo so you actually

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.690 
update and called latigo so you actually
have<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.510> option<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.260> generate<00:00:10.889> your<00:00:11.280> loadout

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
have the option to generate your loadout

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
have the option to generate your loadout
so<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.910> figured<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.240> make<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> into<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> series

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
so I figured I make it into a series

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.780 
so I figured I make it into a series
where<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.440> try<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> get<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.860> Kem<00:00:14.070> strike<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
where I try to get a Kem strike with the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.540 
where I try to get a Kem strike with the
most<00:00:15.120> craziest<00:00:15.690> most<00:00:16.230> random<00:00:16.770> class<00:00:17.010> setup<00:00:17.369> so

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
most craziest most random class setup so

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.099 
most craziest most random class setup so
as<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.910> guys<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.270> see<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:18.930> got

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.450 
as you guys can see right here we got
the<00:00:19.289> vector<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.800> muzzle<00:00:20.220> brake<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the vector with muzzle brake and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.759 
the vector with muzzle brake and
holographic<00:00:21.300> sight<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.960> also<00:00:22.140> got<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> smoke

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
holographic sight we also got the smoke

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.500 
holographic sight we also got the smoke
grenades<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.580> guys<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.420> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
grenades you guys can see right there in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.000 
grenades you guys can see right there in
the<00:00:24.600> bottom<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:24.960> got<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> perks<00:00:25.500> man<00:00:25.710> pretty

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the bottom we got the perks man pretty

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
the bottom we got the perks man pretty
crazy<00:00:26.430> pretty<00:00:26.550> quite<00:00:27.119> don't<00:00:27.330> make<00:00:27.480> sense<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
crazy pretty quite don't make sense and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240 
crazy pretty quite don't make sense and
I'm<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> pretty<00:00:28.260> random<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.010> without

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I'm the pretty random but so without

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.009 
I'm the pretty random but so without
further<00:00:29.429> ado<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.840> gameplay

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
further ado let's get into this gameplay

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
further ado let's get into this gameplay
so<00:00:31.380> we're<00:00:31.500> playing<00:00:31.650> some<00:00:31.830> domination<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
so we're playing some domination on the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
so we're playing some domination on the
map<00:00:33.030> Warhawk<00:00:33.480> probably<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> best

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
map Warhawk probably one of the best

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.920 
map Warhawk probably one of the best
maps<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.210> creme<00:00:36.450> strike<00:00:36.690> just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
maps to go for this creme strike just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
maps to go for this creme strike just
because<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.070> vector<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> pretty

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
because you know the vector is a pretty

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
because you know the vector is a pretty
nice<00:00:39.120> SMG<00:00:39.750> probably<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> best<00:00:40.620> SMGs

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
nice SMG probably one of the best SMGs

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.030 
nice SMG probably one of the best SMGs
in<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> game<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.230> we

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
in this game and you know we got the we

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
in this game and you know we got the we
got<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.210> holographic<00:00:45.210> sight<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.750> also

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
got the holographic sight and we also

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
got the holographic sight and we also
got<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> muzzle<00:00:46.559> break<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:47.160> allows<00:00:47.399> us<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
got the muzzle break which allows us to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.549 
got the muzzle break which allows us to
have<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:47.969> good<00:00:48.180> range<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.780> probably<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
have pretty good range so probably one

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.779 
have pretty good range so probably one
of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> best<00:00:49.860> maps<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> scam

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
of the best maps to go for the scam

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
of the best maps to go for the scam
strike<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.270> eventually<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.289> gameplay

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
strike which eventually in this gameplay

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.720 
strike which eventually in this gameplay
you<00:00:52.710> guys<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> Kem<00:00:53.640> strike

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you guys will see I get the Kem strike

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
you guys will see I get the Kem strike
so<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.270> also<00:00:54.570> did<00:00:54.870> pick<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> mtar<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so I also did pick up the mtar with the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.709 
so I also did pick up the mtar with the
tracker<00:00:56.430> side<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.000> guys<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.510> just

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
tracker side as you guys can see just

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
tracker side as you guys can see just
because<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.590> scavenger<00:00:59.219> until

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
because I don't have scavenger until

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
because I don't have scavenger until
specialist<00:01:00.300> bonus<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.440> 10<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.800> 11

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
specialist bonus which is like 10 or 11

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
specialist bonus which is like 10 or 11
kills<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> figured<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.270> pick<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.629> weapon

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
kills so I figured I pick up a weapon

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
kills so I figured I pick up a weapon
and<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.830> sure<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.100> run<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and just make sure I don't run out of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
and just make sure I don't run out of
ammo<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.299> Kem<00:01:06.570> strike<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.320> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
ammo and get that Kem strike so on so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
ammo and get that Kem strike so on so
yeah<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> brand<00:01:08.549> new<00:01:08.700> series<00:01:08.970> here

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
yeah so we got a brand new series here

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
yeah so we got a brand new series here
guys<00:01:09.420> pretty<00:01:09.869> unique<00:01:10.260> pretty<00:01:10.920> different<00:01:11.189> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
guys pretty unique pretty different I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.890 
guys pretty unique pretty different I
figured<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> know

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
figured I make it just because you know

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
figured I make it just because you know
I<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.500> searching<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.070> YouTube<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I was actually searching on YouTube I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
I was actually searching on YouTube I
was<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.420> random<00:01:15.930> class<00:01:16.229> generator

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
was like you know random class generator

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.710 
was like you know random class generator
Kem<00:01:17.340> strike<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.850> something<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
Kem strike or something like that and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
Kem strike or something like that and
nothing<00:01:19.680> came<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.400> call<00:01:20.549> did<00:01:20.759> he<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
nothing came up for call did he go so I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
nothing came up for call did he go so I
figured<00:01:21.509> might<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
figured might as well make it and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.380 
figured might as well make it and
actually<00:01:23.009> look<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:23.939> my<00:01:24.119> smoke
