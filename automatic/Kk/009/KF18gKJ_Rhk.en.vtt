00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.340
 8 o'clock in the morning and now it is still 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.059
 quiet but is just silence for the 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.040
 storm 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.020
 well they push you yourself I think you 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.759
 However, staff benefits were very competitive 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.990
 must be patient 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.460
 but it is really nice out there 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.920
 age then train and be whole 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.080
 playful and his honest what 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.240
 cozy thinking also for the young 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.000
 talents originated from under 10 one 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.390
 nice development if you participate then 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.580
 to your old clothes and that it is beautiful 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.410
 club is fc utrecht it was my dream to 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.840
 there they play again 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.380
 today the match against the neighbor camp 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.059
 to 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.309
 but first a match review that 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.200
 is unique because the players 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.550
 set their own goals four times and 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.800
 man playing out 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.700
 three times okay so three times a site 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.020
 play out 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.280
 we call it aware we do 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.780
 try every every 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.730
 match discussion we try different 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.559
 to fill in 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.180
 today they did that with objectives 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.640
 sometimes we do that they own the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.289
 call a match discussion with videos 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.670
 He aims that there is that they themselves aware 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.390
 trying to hear from what they are doing 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.659
 to be 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.130
 that they try to think for themselves what 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.560
 objectives and what they want 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 and we do not believe that 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 it needs only one of the train 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.880
 but that the boys themselves are there 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.549
 think about what they want to achieve 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.409
 but you try your own goal 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.150
 try to get that today 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.770
 and as good team play football 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:40.810
 freedom have a lot of fun 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:42.189
 yes, his feeling that goes around 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.900
 that you discover talent 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.790
 a long way to go and indeed 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.090
 never and talent that has not targeted 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.430
 sure yes it's about your talent 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.250
 indeed discovered a long way to go 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.229
 18 more and let it be clear 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.240
 that you can see which new players are on 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.920
 a good basic technique which have 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.170
 those football intelligence have such 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.979
 site that call good motor skills 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.450
 to have 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.969
 yes and then the conclusion is that 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 utrecht in this region at this age 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.019
 can simply offer a lot of talent 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.890
 because that talent touched FC Utrecht 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.540
 once lost 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.450
 no i think that girlfriend is already has 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.830
 demonstrated that and past there are major 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.960
 calendar tits they are other clubs 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.850
 go because utrecht 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.400
 who can offer no place to play 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.200
 so play as bazur as as labyad 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.240
 as afellay 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.450
 they are all Utrecht boys 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.020
 when the time was on our list 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.090
 we ourselves 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.620
 train along from that collaboration 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.300
 but in the end they could not 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.990
 they were not allowed to host and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.740
 our competition 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.630
 because we have structure in a bv 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.430
 and only clips with the permit 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.100
 structure were allowed to do this and that is now 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.290
 so all different so that the future 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.480
 tailor cenav flights just in the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.650
 can play their own gallows 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.200
 yes and I am still proud of you 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.580
 because we are the enrichment for everyone 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.770
 especially for the players and parents themselves 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.410
 to this region where they are in it 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.340
 in the past many had to travel to a company 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.320
 io 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.820
 chelsea children at this age in one 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.710
 host family 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.810
 we had to sit it now 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.260
 self- appalling salvers think very much 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.260
 good
