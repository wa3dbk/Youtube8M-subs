00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
sensors which honestly is pretty much

sensors which honestly is pretty much
useless<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> transmits<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.820> engines

funny<00:00:44.810> thing<00:00:45.050> about<00:00:45.340> transferring<00:00:46.340> power<00:00:46.520> two

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
funny thing about transferring power two

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.480 
funny thing about transferring power two
inches<00:00:47.270> is<00:00:47.890> later<00:00:48.890> on<00:00:49.040> when<00:00:49.160> you<00:00:49.250> get<00:00:49.370> the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
inches is later on when you get the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.310 
inches is later on when you get the
target<00:00:49.940> long<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.300> kind<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.600> increases<00:00:51.170> the

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
target long and kind of increases the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.300 
target long and kind of increases the
target<00:00:51.710> on<00:00:51.830> speed<00:00:52.360> now<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.960> game<00:00:54.200> manual<00:00:54.860> says

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
target on speed now the game manual says

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.390 
target on speed now the game manual says
that<00:00:55.670> increasing<00:00:56.150> power<00:00:56.300> which<00:00:56.450> is<00:00:56.600> sensors

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
that increasing power which is sensors

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.650 
that increasing power which is sensors
increases<00:00:58.400> the<00:01:00.070> block<00:01:01.070> Target<00:01:01.910> Lock<00:01:01.940> speeds

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
increases the block Target Lock speeds

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.750 
increases the block Target Lock speeds
buts

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
buts

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.030 
buts
it<00:01:04.150> doesn't<00:01:04.629> make<00:01:05.259> sense

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
it doesn't make sense

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.980 
it doesn't make sense
I<00:01:07.130> don't<00:01:07.370> know<00:01:07.460> why<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:08.110> also

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
I don't know why that is also

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.380 
I don't know why that is also
you<00:01:11.350> press<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.650> up<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:12.700> can<00:01:12.790> transfer<00:01:13.180> power

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
you press it up you can transfer power

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.870 
you press it up you can transfer power
for<00:01:13.810> your<00:01:13.930> shields<00:01:14.380> your<00:01:14.619> weapons<00:01:15.070> which<00:01:15.729> will

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
for your shields your weapons which will

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.670 
for your shields your weapons which will
increase<00:01:16.210> your<00:01:16.329> weapon<00:01:16.810> recharge<00:01:17.229> rate<00:01:17.470> but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
increase your weapon recharge rate but

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.940 
increase your weapon recharge rate but
also

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
also

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.120 
also
make<00:01:19.520> your<00:01:19.759> shields<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.299> bit<00:01:20.450> weaker<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.439> vice

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
make your shields a bit weaker and vice

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.039 
make your shields a bit weaker and vice
versa<00:01:22.460> if<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:22.939> transfer<00:01:23.299> power<00:01:23.479> from<00:01:23.539> weapons

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
versa if you transfer power from weapons

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.899 
versa if you transfer power from weapons
to<00:01:24.079> shields<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.159> reach<00:01:25.340> your<00:01:25.549> entry<00:01:25.820> will

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
to shields you reach your entry will

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.590 
to shields you reach your entry will
slow<00:01:26.329> down<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:26.899> you'll<00:01:27.110> get<00:01:27.289> more<00:01:27.500> shielding

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 

I<00:01:30.659> usually<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.740> having<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> stuff

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I usually like having this kind of stuff

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780 
I usually like having this kind of stuff
I<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.299> power<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> her<00:01:33.930> two<00:01:34.170> engines

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.780 

Congrats<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:38.560> optimize<00:01:39.160> really

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.740 

oh<00:01:43.170> yeah<00:01:44.520> sometimes<00:01:45.520> Vegas<00:01:46.090> will<00:01:46.210> be<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> bit

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
oh yeah sometimes Vegas will be a bit

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.490 
oh yeah sometimes Vegas will be a bit
tricky<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:48.090> careful

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.560 

oh<00:01:51.560> for<00:01:51.920> God's<00:01:52.190> sakes

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
oh for God's sakes

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.260 
oh for God's sakes
okay<00:01:55.580> apparently<00:01:56.580> my<00:01:56.729> camera<00:01:57.120> berries

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.300 
okay apparently my camera berries

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.950 

I<00:02:01.399> hate<00:02:01.880> when<00:02:02.060> my<00:02:02.180> camera<00:02:02.509> battery<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:02.899> about

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
I hate when my camera battery is about

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.190 
I hate when my camera battery is about
to<00:02:03.229> die<00:02:03.350> anyway<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.820> next<00:02:04.850> objective<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.840> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
to die anyway the next objective is to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.830 
to die anyway the next objective is to
target<00:02:07.100> lock<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.579> destroy<00:02:07.850> these<00:02:08.030> containers

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.540 

now<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.170> had<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.500> pretty<00:02:12.800> much<00:02:12.920> target<00:02:13.370> other

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
now you had to pretty much target other

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.590 
now you had to pretty much target other
the<00:02:13.849> majority<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.420> them

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
the majority of them

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720 
the majority of them
your<00:02:15.870> tech<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.260> lobster<00:02:16.680> tells<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.430> how<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
your tech and lobster tells you how to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.440 
your tech and lobster tells you how to
target<00:02:18.180> lock

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
target lock

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.000 
target lock
target<00:02:20.200> locked<00:02:20.470> items

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.830 

you<00:02:24.129> are<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.819> so

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you are you so

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:40.250 
you are you so
don't<00:02:27.050> worry<00:02:27.319> about

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.150 

really

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.680 

I'm<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> video<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.160> here<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.660> I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
I'm going to have the video of here so I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960 
I'm going to have the video of here so I
can<00:02:49.840> change<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> berries<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.340> camera

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
can change the berries in my camera

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.110 
can change the berries in my camera
I<00:02:52.030> really<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:53.020> want<00:02:53.290> Barry<00:02:53.680> style
