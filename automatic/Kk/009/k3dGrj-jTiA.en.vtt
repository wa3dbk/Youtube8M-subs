00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.090 

no<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.660> think<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.590> regular<00:02:28.890> plane

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.380 

boss<00:02:35.100> Alliance<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.790> our<00:02:35.910> regular<00:02:36.060> plane<00:02:41.390> but

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
boss Alliance it's our regular plane but

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.410 
boss Alliance it's our regular plane but
mine<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.690> little<00:02:42.870> practice<00:02:50.180> that's<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.300> its

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
mine is little practice that's what its

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.220 
mine is little practice that's what its
gonna<00:02:51.570> look<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:53.660> yeah<00:02:54.660> because<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.200> has

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
gonna look like that yeah because it has

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
gonna look like that yeah because it has
to<00:02:55.530> follow<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.800> flight<00:02:56.100> pan<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.550> else<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
to follow that flight pan or else it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.850 
to follow that flight pan or else it
will<00:02:57.090> miss<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.420> runway

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:04:03.420
