00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.480
 with 250 hp over the highway 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.599
 the Mercedes 300 SL is a rare sight 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.199
 Mercedes restorer Klaus many knows their vintage cars as part of the elaborate 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.099
 at 14, he began his apprenticeship as a car mechanic 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.599
 To this day, he focuses mainly on the classical 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.350
 It has always been my dream to work on these vehicles as well. "What they do 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.720
 with these vehicles 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.629
 just as he was working his way out we needed that to be a norm 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.990
 such in Poland should be preserved 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.860
 in Klaus Kinast 8000 square meter empire 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.900
 in Heimerdingen near Stuttgart but stars lit up 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.760
 even totally ailing vehicles are made roadworthy here again 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.940
 once they are alike, they should not be slowed down anymore 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.620
 So the philosophy is definitely my make-up started back then 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.500
 said 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.800
 the best or nothing then is our mind 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.390
 the vehicles inside 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.820
 Wilson 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.780
 Hundreds of people are able to put Iris bag and so true to the original 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.530
 to carry out except the polished up between Nordhausen under 50 000th 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.520
 a customer is prepared depending on the state at 5000 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.810
 the clientele must be well-heeled so Martina leads a major project of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.590
 Client to the royal family of Qatar 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.270
 6 600 although one should be brought up to scratch on the state bodies 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.820
 belong to the prestige projects from the house Mercedes three of the royals 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.250
 Cars have already been flown in 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.409
 So this Pohlmann 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.710
 and that's also him state as well as has come from Qatar 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.860
 of course it is eternal round the weather conditions with Arias 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.440
 convey 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.550
 and salt water in the air all that even in the car to man yourself too 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.380
 here's all the crap a jam 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.789
 why the vehicle is still in its original condition Chrome is everything 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.259
 as it was then delivered in the museum or once again made 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.199
 however, completely wrong fake besides false padding calfskin quality 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.139
 It says everything has to be ripped out all new and in 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.929
 makes a troika 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 it's still a lot of work York living we're packing 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.669
 For the first time tackling means getting rid of every little corner of the sand 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.710
 although her cars were hardly used 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.400
 Weather conditions outside and inside have strongly affected them 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:37.370
 this conclusion explicitly drove 7800 kilometers 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.159
 around his still new car but by that heidi is quite center stood in the 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.619
 Ministers also hardly moved them, of course, all the old stuff 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.819
 to no longer use 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.299
 so get out there 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.169
 a lucrative though 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.559
 Andy's busy business 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:58.129
 2500 working hours, however, 600, although you invested 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.379
 if possible all athletic to build him a carer and prepare 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.539
 almost everything 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.269
 they are currently hot are railings that they are one 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.379
 Improved ignition system still installed they have hidden installed 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.099
 that for the home start and that's just state accordingly their whole 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.749
 Ignition runs better and that the vehicles are better started 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.089
 can of course 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.449
 The worst thing that can happen when the vehicles 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.589
 before a trip for this due when state visit is there 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:26.999
 small and where to ask 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.539
 because turn-king now wave to the people then suddenly the car was not 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 Of course, being more different is deadly 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.499
 soon is always important 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.559
 every customer is king and sometimes the king is every customer 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:43.650
 more interesting than the origin are technical subtleties for the employees 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:47.529
 of the cars as well as the three units of the 600 pole-man 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.519
 another world a rush 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.419
 Mainz was worthwhile 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.930
 take apart the technique the grief the equations present with 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:57.279
 units 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.299
 Window lifter citizen 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.099
 yes, no nation found many different versions of bulletproof glass 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.609
 and bulletproof glass 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.129
 Here are a few 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.939
 larger forces 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.839
 beautiful actually 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.569
 the heart of the 600 is the v8 a speaker 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:21.139
 In good condition, the sedan can accelerate to 205 Karin Hahn 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.490
 the problem here too 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.169
 when Israel get there 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.819
 for the lifetimes have this long from the sand that now it applies 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.099
 Sightings 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.789
 or is it all the way? 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.969
 Diversions can be a gene in the engine compartment 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.349
 after the moto 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.499
 and were cleared of the sand and waited the day where reset to zero 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.749
 because then the engine goes again as new 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:44.809
 and that's what he looks like
