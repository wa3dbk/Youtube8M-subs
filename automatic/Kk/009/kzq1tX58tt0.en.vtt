00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello channel subscribers reduce 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.509
 gaming 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.450
 and today there will be a more detailed analysis 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.950
 here's a thing like 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:18.090
 dota 2 config to find and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.750
 make it possible to drink 4post in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.400
 which I put under one of the past 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.310
 video 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.080
 game settings dota 2 or you can 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 watch this kite and i will be over 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 I'll figure out what that candy does open 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.399
 local file properties so you can 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.840
 quick and easy to power the date folder 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.230
 local files see local 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 files here now move on to fetus 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.430
 and the folder further go cfg folder here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.489
 this file open it 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.039
 double-click the list in difficult 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:03.420
 programs, well, for example, you can 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:08.040
 notebook here it is the config 1 here it is 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 the lines they change this line here 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 resizes the hero on the minimap 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 here's how you might have noticed at the initial 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 daughter and very small icons but for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 to make it easier 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.710
 it is possible to replace the gap of opponents before 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.580
 put big 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 some enjoy a general such from 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.780
 huge dick not on the whole minimap 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.390
 These are the ones responsible for speed. 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.820
 mice there cameras well there are no mice 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.920
 on themselves laden with speed like this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.979
 about for me and raider 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:55.860
 here we are moving around the edge of the screen 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:02:02.820
 the speed is so insert it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:06.300
 us on such a thing as you can say it 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.679
 something like that instead of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:15.540
 each time the table is the difference between 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.360
 heroes and click on the poof and the place here 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.230
 it's all very long I'm here we are just 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.760
 click on c and every time we have 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.470
 gives way to mipo clicked on c again 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450
 time necessary to pursue our next instant 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.760
 we don’t need to press right away 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.209
 how would we specify when to poofy 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.239
 just a quick cyclic lecture cry cyclic and y 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:50.220
 7 of us are confused very useful thing 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:56.870
 this here this next comes right attack 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.860
 click the right mouse button there and when 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.490
 we 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.030
 we can finish allied creeps 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.190
 which does not allow the opponent to receive full 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.450
 the amount of experience they don't get for 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.730
 only 50 percent and for that you need 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.700
 click on a and allied hero or 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.940
 we can put in config or it 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 You can also register the console further 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 go here it is the bandage on the runes 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:34.770
 push 2 goes to this throne so 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:38.959
 bigger i'll do no seems not from no 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:45.030
 much larger became so let it cost 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:48.330
 goes to the top rune on top 2 of her 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.180
 coordinates pointing this goes to 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.310
 rune on bot top top rune here is lower 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.790
 rune here here here here somehow 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.209
 etc 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:05.150
 quick reports here we can specify 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.870
 here it shows timing in chat 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.819
 writes we can click on y hook there how 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.759
 there is a chat wheel and we can choose the time 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.669
 see arash we need to remember when 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:23.900
 a rashan will appear click on x or n 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.030
 we write the time we and after 7 12 minutes 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.330
 again we come check 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.539
 and pick it up besides how can 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.590
 use this key in order 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.240
 so that there is a collider we check click 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.740
 on x and we are sure to us when he is not 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:47.930
 will refuse hill Sechin members short 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:52.669
 all skills from big time big 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.310
 recharge time further it changes 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.320
 color a on minimap how could you 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.419
 first notice whether they are green in my opinion 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:04.210
 I do not have red, they are slightly different colors 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:08.509
 i like it so much and my config 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.900
 illegible hels bar originally in dota 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:16.580
 nicely taken away in jerks this one 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.180
 config allows you to well health and 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.690
 a little 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:28.690
 Nerf Nerf Camera Immediately Further Here It Is 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.130
 here are 9 health on such segments 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.139
 adversary ie we can know 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.639
 how many count these segments can 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.800
 before you count how much they have and 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.570
 despite despite not clicking on it 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.909
 as each segment of 250 hp that is, well 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.729
 pooja who has 5,000 strength there we don’t 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.020
 teaches and but at the first levels there have 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.199
 human one segment 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.470
 that is, 250 x n we can for him 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.010
 hall well 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:06:03.330
 yes give the camp and kill my kill 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:06.569
 it seems there is also an indicator 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.099
 activity was that is if we 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:14.909
 throw the hook click on the hook 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:16.499
 the green bar which is bright first 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.990
 then pales as soon as 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:24.119
 ring skill ends and that is 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.749
 the indicator actively sang so on that 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.749
 I can still say 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.600
 I no longer remember that there is a lot that 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.600
 does but you have you but we all
