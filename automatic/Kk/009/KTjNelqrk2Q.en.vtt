00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello my name is the hairstyle 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.340
 creative 30th street of gramont paris 2e 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 so I'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 treats the hair before going 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.439
 sun holiday expose them to the sun 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 so for that there is therefore care 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.890
 to protect them it's exactly 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.990
 like an anti-UV for the skin so 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 this one protects the hair 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.289
 so it's an antioxidant it's applied 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.289
 like this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.469
 so it's a gesture that will have to be repeated 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.840
 several times in the day 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.660
 it's exactly the same principle when 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.000
 I told you that an anti uv for the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.370
 skin so it's applied to hair 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.979
 wet or dry product that does not 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.970
 not strike the hair on the contrary it 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.649
 brings a shine and of course and he 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.119
 is easier to untangle hair 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.310
 who were therefore treating the whole 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.759
 Hair that day we could not 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.890

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.320
 glittery it's very nice so we were 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.550
 it's even if you do not have that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.880

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.640
 if we have an evening in the evening it's 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.580
