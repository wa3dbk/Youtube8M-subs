00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 They are always restless to know that 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.690
 it is convenient or that it is not convenient to feed 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.570
 I would like us to play our next 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.700
 secret that talks about what foods we 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.700
 harm or benefit us 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.740
 let's start with something that is many 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.640
 people get hit but give you the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.930
 explainable if you are if you have stopped 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.550
 suck on their suspicions that they have given of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.270
 suck 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.780
 no more 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.700
 or dairy because he knows that I'm going to 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.640
 through television many houses are 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.750
 sold is validated and the fishing grounds 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.750
 taking out a gun 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:04.300
 scientifically proven that greater 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 genetics 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.020
 when a child 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.580
 mom 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.140
 digestive enzymes breastfeeding 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.190
 the queen or the border that is left 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 produce 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.740
 and that's when we take 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.130
 people to do with whole that the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130
 make 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.220
 in my life 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.760
 bowel is accommodated as a layer 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.500
 social rule 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.270
 that person has to use a lot of color 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.119
 therapy 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.900
 it accumulates in the fronts and arteries 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.690
 as fats causing high expression 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.340
 the excess of cholesterol 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.510
 heart disease and all those phases of 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.010
 bengasi looks good nature forgives 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 the vulgarity 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.190
 do you know that knife sucks the texas and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.190
 another cow 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:30.850
 in nature, milk is destined 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:33.120
 only for my son but here will 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.120
 drink 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.849
 clear now we understand why many 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.160
 moms come and experience firsthand 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.099
 that milk powders hurt you 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.019
 his children and they believe that it is the brand 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.480
 that are constantly changing 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.099
 brand trying others because because the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.510
 children have inflammations, gas, vomiting 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.080
 additionally they cry because they have 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.080
 Colic 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.070
 Y 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.090
 good consumption of vegetable milk 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.360
 it is very important because in it we can 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.700
 find a wide range of varieties and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.990
 we also have a good contribution of 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.900
 proteins 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.670
 and spas the good thing that we have is that no 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.290
 we are going to produce allergies in many 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.840
 cases like milk can cause us 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.010
 of cow and we know that many studies 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 They have shown that cow's milk 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.630
 can produce a high amount of mucus 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.090
 especially in those airways of 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.410
 children and in the cereals we have 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.930
 different cereals like rice is like this 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.640
 What can bats bring us? 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.990
 also for the intestinal part that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.730
 It also has a lot of 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.390
 albumin that also has an effect 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.060
 diuretic because of its low sodium content 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.400
 This is why it is very good we have another 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.040
 as soybean oil is important then 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.810
 that either non-transgenic type and that 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.580
 also be a single germinated so that 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.860
 have greater 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.040
 digestibility but that also has a 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.320
 great protein intake on the other hand 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.030
 we have in the milk of birdseed in the 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.070
 birdseed we have a lot of 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.470
 amino acids almost similar to the one that could 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.850
 have an animal protein and the good thing about 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.560
 this is that it also has some 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.690
 substances that help us reduce the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.030
 blood cholesterol and they improve us 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.920
 also the function of the pancreas for 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.590
 produce better insulin then we have 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.080
 well here in the vegetable milks a 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.810
 great contribution also that we will have a 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.460
 kidney much more rest because if 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.110
 we put large amounts of 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.600
 animal proteins then we will have 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.340
 that work more and we know that the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.110
 proteins of plant origin are going to 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.420
 remove the lung and will not have 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.430
 no compromise at the renal level 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.230
 experience that I have with my family in 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.030
 this case in the use of those of 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.730
 seven vegetables gives me a great 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.560
 tranquility since my children then 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.180
 compared to another have another garden and 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.529
 with my patients they have much less 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.239
 episodes of 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.879
 respiratory problems of airway 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:01.919
 superior and inferior and also the part 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.679
 digestive your digestive functioning is 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.479
 much better compared to other children not 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.869
 they have constipation they do not present 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.869
 two depressions 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.370
 let's say out of the ordinary then I 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.740
 I really recommend them 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.419
 where the different laws of metals 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.840
 that exist because with this we can 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.400
 achieve a very good 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.400
 say hello our children 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:40.470
 do not want to be too hard seriously 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.770
 for example put them to our leave 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.440
 home and if mom does not work all the 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.550
 world dies of hunger then between two 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.960
 evils in general in the minor but it is a 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.120
 terrible mistake 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.669
 so that the child is more luxuries more 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.720
 silver for mom also works also 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.420
 with the best dress 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.200
 we are going to see damage done with the marm 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.800
 not breastfeed 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:14.080
 natural medicine teaches that minimum 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.480
 minimum 9 months rubiales 2 years 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.850
 they were hard among the indigenous 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.810
 Suckling your children up to four years 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.840
 I know here a naturopath doctor 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:31.900
 that more than three years the funny 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.900
 because the child said to Mami 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.720
 besides milk only food suitable for 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:49.550
 that we make mom and I do not 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.550
 we could ride some humans 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:01.820
 although without capacity the ideal would be a 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:05.000
 second best option but 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:08.720
 cow's milk has three times more 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.660
 protected that the breast milk that the 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.970
 child grows faster usa in many 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.380
 artistic books like the milk that you 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:21.740
 they gave and have noticed that there is excess 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.830
 growth and mental retardation you 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:30.680
 prefer this from moms it's a big 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:32.920
 mistake the best gift under silver so 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.920
 can you give a child is to know what 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.920
 breastfed
