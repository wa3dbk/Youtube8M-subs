00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
rusty bicycle chain there isn't really

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.390 
rusty bicycle chain there isn't really
any<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:15.199> completely<00:00:16.199> remove<00:00:16.680> rust<00:00:17.010> from<00:00:17.310> a

any way to completely remove rust from a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.010 
any way to completely remove rust from a
bicycle<00:00:17.580> chain<00:00:17.910> unless<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.600> were<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.869> use

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
bicycle chain unless you were to use

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.040 
bicycle chain unless you were to use
some<00:00:19.350> type<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> rust<00:00:19.949> remover<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:21.840> in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
some type of rust remover but then in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230 
some type of rust remover but then in
that<00:00:22.140> case<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:22.949> strip<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that case you would strip all the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.380 
that case you would strip all the
necessary<00:00:24.630> oils<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.939> links<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
necessary oils out of the the links and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
necessary oils out of the the links and
the<00:00:27.449> pins<00:00:27.689> kind<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.260> between<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the pins kind of in between there and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.859 
the pins kind of in between there and
then<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.699> would<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.970> stiff<00:00:30.300> links<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> have

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
then you would get stiff links and have

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
then you would get stiff links and have
a<00:00:30.929> whole<00:00:31.109> other<00:00:31.260> problem<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.830> hands

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
a whole other problem on your hands

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.850 
a whole other problem on your hands
so<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> chain<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.710> looks

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so if you do have a chain that looks

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.690 
so if you do have a chain that looks
pretty<00:00:35.100> rusty<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> crusty<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.170> one

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
pretty rusty and crusty like this one

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
pretty rusty and crusty like this one
the<00:00:38.700> best<00:00:39.050> solution<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.680> ahead<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the best solution is just go ahead and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
the best solution is just go ahead and
leave<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> chain<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> bike<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.649> put<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
leave the chain on the bike and put a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.850 
leave the chain on the bike and put a
little<00:00:44.149> bicycle<00:00:45.149> specific<00:00:46.110> chain<00:00:46.410> lube<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
little bicycle specific chain lube on

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.889 
little bicycle specific chain lube on
the<00:00:47.160> chain<00:00:48.410> what<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.620> use<00:00:49.860> specifically<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
the chain what we use specifically is

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.490 
the chain what we use specifically is
just<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.160> your<00:00:53.160> average<00:00:53.610> run-of-the-mill

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
just a your average run-of-the-mill

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
just a your average run-of-the-mill
lubricant<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.680> called<00:00:55.829> tri<00:00:56.190> flow<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.270> can

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
lubricant it's called tri flow you can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.099 
lubricant it's called tri flow you can
also<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.840> white<00:00:58.109> lightning<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.980> t-9<00:00:59.579> or

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
also use white lightning or t-9 or

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
also use white lightning or t-9 or
anything<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.469> our<00:01:01.500> bike<00:01:02.219> mechanic<00:01:02.789> would

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
anything that our bike mechanic would

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
anything that our bike mechanic would
recommend<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
recommend to you and the way that you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
recommend to you and the way that you
would<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> nozzle<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
would do that is just put the nozzle of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.609 
would do that is just put the nozzle of
the<00:01:08.390> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> dispenser<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.170> whatever<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the kind of dispenser or whatever and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.030 
the kind of dispenser or whatever and
then<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> squeeze<00:01:11.729> lightly<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.619> pedal

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then just squeeze lightly in back pedal

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.090 
then just squeeze lightly in back pedal
just<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> kind

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
just a little bit and get kind of kind

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
just a little bit and get kind of kind
of<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:17.280> even<00:01:17.670> spread<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> chain

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of an even spread there on the chain

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.420 
of an even spread there on the chain
just<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.350> ahead<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> saturate<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> once

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
just go ahead and saturate it and once

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
just go ahead and saturate it and once
it's<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's kind of you know you can see it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.749 
it's kind of you know you can see it's
kind<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:27.240> take<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.570> rag<00:01:27.960> and

kind of on there you take your rag and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.230 
kind of on there you take your rag and
again<00:01:29.759> back<00:01:30.420> peddling<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.590> hold<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.240> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
again back peddling just hold it on the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.730 
again back peddling just hold it on the
chain<00:01:35.329> also<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> sides<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> chain<00:01:37.530> as

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
chain also do the sides of the chain as

links as well and I get your chain

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
links as well and I get your chain
performing<00:01:57.210> better<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.720> would<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
performing better than it would be if it

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
performing better than it would be if it
were<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.590> straight<00:01:59.220> rusty<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.910> gross

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
were just straight rusty and gross

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.720 
were just straight rusty and gross
uh-huh<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.620> that<00:02:01.980> is<00:02:02.190> how<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.410> lube<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.890> kind
