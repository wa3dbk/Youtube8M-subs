Hello everyone! A-Ri here again!

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.080
Spring is finally here! Is everyone ready to go see the Cherry Blossoms?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.980
Today I’d like to introduce to you a great treat for that outing!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.580
The good thing about this treat is you don’t have to bake your own bread and can use what they already sell!

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.140
Here’s my version of the recipe! 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.000
Whip the butter that has been brought up to room temperature.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.880
Beat the eggs as well that were set to room temperature.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.400
Whip it until the sugar has completely dissolved.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.760
Add salt

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Add lemon juice

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.280
Finally sift in flower and baking powder and mix it thoroughly.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.460
Pour the mix on a baking pan and bake it in the oven at 180 degrees for 20 minutes.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.800
Once it’s baked, break it up into crumbs.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.560
Now it’s time to mash it into one ball! You can use leftover jam or cream that you have at home, or even leftover frosting.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.840
Once you mix it well, separate them into balls (30g each), then melt some white chocolate that will be used for the cake sticks.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.280
After you’ve created the balls, dip it into the chocolate and poke it with the stick.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.000
Place them in the freezer for 30 minutes.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.460
Melt some more chocolate and dip the frozen balls from the freezer.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.980
Tap your wrist to remove the excess chocolate.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.920
After they’ve hardened, you might notice some cracks. Don’t worry! We’re gonna add another layer!

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.600
After adding a second layer, add edible pearls to the outer layer. Let them completely solidify now. 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.140
Now it’s time to make the cherry blossoms! We’re gonna use the sugar fondant we made yesterday.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.160

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.820
Roll the dough to a thickness of roughly 0.2cm.

00:04:00.894 --> 00:04:04.014
Use a cookie cutter for the flower shapes.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.900
Gently press the flower petals with your fingers

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.000
I used a tool to add some articulation to the flowers.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.440
I also made indentations in the middle to make them easier to fold.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
The coloring I’m using is called dusting coloring that’s used for sugar craft.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.140
If you don’t have this, you can use regular food coloring as well :)

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.780
I used a brush with water and food coloring to add more detail.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.580
Again I’ve added edible pearls for decoration.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.080
Use a bottle cap to finalize the shape of the flowers. They will harden with this final shape.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.460
Once they’ve all hardened, use the left over chocolate to stick on the flowers.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.340
All done! 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.260
