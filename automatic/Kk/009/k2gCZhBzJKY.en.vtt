got really lucky that they missed out I
mean<00:04:30.990> they<00:04:31.139> really<00:04:31.350> should<00:04:31.620> have<00:04:31.710> scored

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
mean they really should have scored

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.159 
mean they really should have scored
there<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.639> thinking<00:04:33.449> oh<00:04:33.600> man<00:04:33.840> again

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
there and I just thinking oh man again

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.230 
there and I just thinking oh man again
better<00:04:34.620> pay<00:04:34.980> more<00:04:35.190> attention<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.760> defense

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
better pay more attention to the defense

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.290 
better pay more attention to the defense
so<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.750> decided<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.590> do<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.949> but<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.030> know<00:04:39.150> me

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
so I decided to do that but you know me

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.540 
so I decided to do that but you know me
playing<00:04:39.660> my<00:04:39.780> offensive<00:04:40.110> football<00:04:40.470> would<00:04:41.370> end

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
playing my offensive football would end

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.370 
playing my offensive football would end
up<00:04:41.669> getting<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:41.970> first<00:04:42.210> goal<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.810> game<00:04:42.960> in

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
up getting the first goal of the game in

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.400 
up getting the first goal of the game in
the<00:04:43.770> 35th<00:04:44.280> minute<00:04:44.550> from<00:04:45.330> picking<00:04:46.139> up<00:04:46.260> that

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
the 35th minute from picking up that

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.920 
the 35th minute from picking up that
rebound<00:04:46.949> and<00:04:47.330> figured<00:04:48.330> out<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.479> way<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.870> it

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
rebound and figured out a way to get it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.080 
rebound and figured out a way to get it
into<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.380> net<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.830> scoring<00:04:50.520> quite<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.820> bit<00:04:51.000> of

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
into the net so scoring quite a bit of

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.000 
into the net so scoring quite a bit of
goals<00:04:51.300> in<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.199> know<00:04:52.320> early<00:04:52.620> part<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:52.889> the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
goals in this you know early part of the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.200 
goals in this you know early part of the
season<00:04:53.040> doing<00:04:53.669> pretty<00:04:53.850> well<00:04:53.940> with<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
season doing pretty well with the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.060 
season doing pretty well with the
attacking<00:04:54.540> movement<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.199> like<00:04:55.680> playing<00:04:55.860> off

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
attacking movement I like playing off

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.700 
attacking movement I like playing off
the<00:04:56.130> striker<00:04:56.610> here<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.229> really<00:04:58.229> do<00:04:58.380> like<00:04:58.530> the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
way that he can hold up the ball and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.820 
way that he can hold up the ball and
it's<00:05:00.690> really<00:05:00.930> helping<00:05:01.200> me<00:05:01.350> out<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.800> know

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
helping me make runs which is what i

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.120 
helping me make runs which is what i
like<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.260> because<00:05:04.590> if<00:05:04.680> he<00:05:04.770> holds<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.070> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
like to do because if he holds up the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.340 
like to do because if he holds up the
ball<00:05:05.430> I<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:06.450> feeding<00:05:06.720> him<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> ball<00:05:07.200> as<00:05:07.320> well

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
when he makes runs but i think his style

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.240 
when he makes runs but i think his style
of<00:05:09.510> play<00:05:09.570> really<00:05:09.900> fits<00:05:10.200> my<00:05:10.410> style<00:05:10.470> play<00:05:10.979> cuz<00:05:11.220> i

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
of play really fits my style play cuz i

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.650 
of play really fits my style play cuz i
like<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.520> make<00:05:11.610> runs<00:05:11.940> like<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.330> one<00:05:12.510> right

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
here you see me go wide and then cut

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.600 
here you see me go wide and then cut
back<00:05:15.450> inside<00:05:15.810> trying<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.350> get<00:05:16.470> baseline<00:05:16.860> i<00:05:17.250> was

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
back inside trying to get baseline i was

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.100 
back inside trying to get baseline i was
thinking<00:05:17.850> about<00:05:18.000> passing<00:05:18.450> it<00:05:18.539> but<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.780> angle

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
thinking about passing it but the angle

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.050 
thinking about passing it but the angle
was<00:05:19.139> not<00:05:19.440> there<00:05:19.740> with<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:19.979> defenders<00:05:20.430> so<00:05:21.030> I

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
was not there with the defenders so I

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.529 
was not there with the defenders so I
was<00:05:21.270> forced<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.930> know<00:05:22.050> take<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:23.240> prayer<00:05:24.240> at

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
was forced to you know take a prayer at

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.029 
was forced to you know take a prayer at
goal<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.080> didn't<00:05:25.320> really<00:05:25.440> work<00:05:25.560> out<00:05:25.830> that

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
goal and it didn't really work out that

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.040 
goal and it didn't really work out that
well<00:05:26.250> but<00:05:27.120> right<00:05:27.270> here<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.510> striker<00:05:27.780> again

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
well but right here the striker again

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.200 
well but right here the striker again
holds<00:05:28.380> up<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.500> ball<00:05:28.740> pretty<00:05:28.979> well<00:05:29.210> but

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
holds up the ball pretty well but

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.210 
holds up the ball pretty well but
unfortunately<00:05:30.840> i<00:05:30.870> would<00:05:31.229> get<00:05:31.440> injured<00:05:32.039> again

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
unfortunately i would get injured again

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.700 
unfortunately i would get injured again
and<00:05:33.000> i<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.389> don't<00:05:33.690> know<00:05:33.780> what<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.110> really<00:05:34.410> do

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
and i just don't know what to really do

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.990 
and i just don't know what to really do
about<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.190> i<00:05:35.310> don't<00:05:35.520> know<00:05:35.580> if<00:05:35.700> there's<00:05:35.880> any

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
about this i don't know if there's any

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.029 
about this i don't know if there's any
way<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.180> fix<00:05:36.450> this<00:05:36.720> my<00:05:36.960> fatigue<00:05:37.320> wasn't<00:05:37.830> that

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
way to fix this my fatigue wasn't that

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.500 
way to fix this my fatigue wasn't that
bad<00:05:38.450> but<00:05:39.450> luckily<00:05:39.750> i<00:05:40.289> ended<00:05:40.560> up<00:05:40.650> scoring<00:05:41.510> the

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
bad but luckily i ended up scoring the

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.779 
bad but luckily i ended up scoring the
only<00:05:42.660> goal<00:05:42.840> that<00:05:43.229> we<00:05:43.349> would<00:05:43.500> score<00:05:43.889> in<00:05:44.130> the

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
only goal that we would score in the

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.580 
only goal that we would score in the
90th<00:05:45.150> minute<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.810> was<00:05:45.960> thinking<00:05:46.080> okay<00:05:46.440> well

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
90th minute so I was thinking okay well

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.740 
90th minute so I was thinking okay well
at<00:05:46.710> least<00:05:46.830> we'll<00:05:47.070> get<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.460> win<00:05:47.700> but<00:05:48.599> I'm

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
at least we'll get the win but I'm

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.300 
at least we'll get the win but I'm
definitely<00:05:49.020> injured<00:05:49.590> even<00:05:49.800> though<00:05:50.039> there's<00:05:50.250> a

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
definitely injured even though there's a

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.920 
definitely injured even though there's a
black<00:05:50.580> man<00:05:50.789> on<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.060> ground<00:05:51.240> instead<00:05:51.660> of<00:05:51.780> me

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
black man on the ground instead of me

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.430 
black man on the ground instead of me
that's<00:05:52.919> quite<00:05:53.160> a<00:05:53.280> funny<00:05:53.550> bug<00:05:53.870> but<00:05:54.870> maybe<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.200> was

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
that's quite a funny bug but maybe I was

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.690 
that's quite a funny bug but maybe I was
playing<00:05:55.680> so<00:05:55.889> well<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.250> that's<00:05:56.370> who<00:05:56.580> they

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
playing so well that that's who they

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.740 
playing so well that that's who they
thought<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:56.910> was<00:05:58.820> anyways<00:05:59.820> I<00:06:00.120> would<00:06:00.270> get<00:06:00.419> subbed

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
thought I was anyways I would get subbed

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.390 
thought I was anyways I would get subbed
out<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:01.229> i<00:06:01.620> don't<00:06:01.740> have<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.950> defend<00:06:02.010> the

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
out and i don't have to defend the

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.129 
out and i don't have to defend the
corner<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:02.970> then<00:06:03.330> they<00:06:03.450> would<00:06:03.599> tie<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:03.810> game

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
corner and then they would tie the game

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.839 
corner and then they would tie the game
in<00:06:04.349> 90th<00:06:04.919> minute<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.370> that<00:06:05.580> would<00:06:05.700> pretty

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
in 90th minute and that would pretty

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.610 
in 90th minute and that would pretty
much<00:06:05.970> do<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:06.330> so<00:06:06.570> we<00:06:06.660> ended<00:06:06.810> up<00:06:06.900> getting<00:06:07.050> a<00:06:07.229> 1-1

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
much do it so we ended up getting a 1-1

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.159 
much do it so we ended up getting a 1-1

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.690 
tie quite unfortunate and also i would
end<00:06:10.380> up<00:06:10.470> getting<00:06:10.710> injured<00:06:11.070> which<00:06:11.310> is<00:06:11.460> another
