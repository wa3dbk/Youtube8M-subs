it's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.350> basic<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.280> red

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's a pretty basic one with all the red

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
it's a pretty basic one with all the red
lights<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.000> stuff<00:01:42.210> i<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.409> how<00:01:43.590> these

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
lights and stuff i do like how these

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.850 
lights and stuff i do like how these
wheels<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.490> fold<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.720> right

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
wheels I'm fold up into them right

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
wheels I'm fold up into them right
micromanager<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:48.110> turns<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.200> pretty

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
micromanager like that turns out pretty

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.920 
micromanager like that turns out pretty
good<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.220> fold<00:01:50.490> down<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.000> only

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
good and then they fold down the only

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.830 
good and then they fold down the only
thing<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> balance<00:01:54.030> it's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
thing I don't like on it is balance it's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
thing I don't like on it is balance it's
really<00:01:55.049> hard<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> balance<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.850> up

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
really hard to balance because it's up

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
really hard to balance because it's up
like<00:01:57.689> basically<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.560> wheel<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.700> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
like basically on one wheel and then it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
like basically on one wheel and then it
tipped<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.420> lot<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> when<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> put

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
tipped over a lot like that when you put

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
tipped over a lot like that when you put
your<00:02:01.439> mini<00:02:01.710> figure<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.119> hard

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
your mini figure in it it's really hard

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.780 
your mini figure in it it's really hard
to<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.689> standing<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> would

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to get standing up so I think that would

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
to get standing up so I think that would
be<00:02:05.880> frustrating<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.990> people<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
be frustrating for some people this

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
be frustrating for some people this
micro<00:02:07.829> manager<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> make<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.550> stand<00:02:08.819> up<00:02:09.060> but

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
micro manager to make it stand up but

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.669 
micro manager to make it stand up but
other<00:02:09.660> than<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.200> pretty<00:02:10.259> cool

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
other than that it's pretty cool

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.370 
other than that it's pretty cool
micromanager<00:02:11.610> here's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.300> look<00:02:12.569> at<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> castle

but<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.350> do<00:04:27.560> like<00:04:27.860> how<00:04:28.100> this<00:04:28.280> piece<00:04:28.580> folds<00:04:28.940> up

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
but I do like how this piece folds up

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.020 
but I do like how this piece folds up
into<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.750> micro<00:04:30.050> manager<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.710> down<00:04:31.400> out<00:04:31.790> of

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
into the micro manager and down out of

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.790 
into the micro manager and down out of
the<00:04:32.090> micro<00:04:32.390> manager<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:33.020> thought<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.560> was

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
the micro manager I thought that was

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.720 
the micro manager I thought that was
pretty<00:04:33.980> cool<00:04:34.510> um<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.990> council<00:04:36.440> Calvary<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:36.950> ok

pretty cool um the council Calvary is ok
I<00:04:37.970> think<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.510> design<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.870> kind<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.880> what's<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
I think the design is kind of what's the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.550 
I think the design is kind of what's the
word<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.390> think<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.690> design<00:04:41.870> is<00:04:42.050> kind<00:04:42.440> of

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
word I think the design is kind of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680 
word I think the design is kind of
scattered<00:04:43.130> out<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.550> random<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.150> mean<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.510> got

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
scattered out and random I mean you got

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.510 
scattered out and random I mean you got
these<00:04:44.870> big<00:04:45.080> wrought<00:04:45.350> iron<00:04:45.740> gates<00:04:46.010> in<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.310> back

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
these big wrought iron gates in the back

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.640 
these big wrought iron gates in the back
just<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.390> could<00:04:47.570> put<00:04:47.750> them<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:47.990> there<00:04:48.200> you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
just so you could put them on there you

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.830 
just so you could put them on there you
got<00:04:48.740> these<00:04:48.920> wheels<00:04:49.220> on<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.580> front<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:50.090> thought

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
got these wheels on the front I thought

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.930 
got these wheels on the front I thought
it<00:04:50.930> was<00:04:51.020> random<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.650> do<00:04:52.010> like<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.700> your

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940

turns<00:04:54.760> around<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.840> shoot<00:04:57.230> stuff

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
turns around and you can shoot stuff

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.470 
turns around and you can shoot stuff
well<00:04:57.980> with<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.520> thought<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:58.850> was<00:04:58.970> cool<00:04:59.210> i

pieces<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.000> stuff<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.540> balcony<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.530> guy<00:05:06.680> can

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
pieces and stuff the balcony the guy can

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.320 
pieces and stuff the balcony the guy can
stand<00:05:07.160> there<00:05:07.310> shoot<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.670> catapults<00:05:08.270> the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
stand there shoot the catapults the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.420

may bricks with it but I really believe

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.380

that<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:13.250> gate<00:05:13.490> is<00:05:13.520> going<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.060> a<00:05:14.090> way

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
that the gate is going to be a way

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.690 
that the gate is going to be a way
