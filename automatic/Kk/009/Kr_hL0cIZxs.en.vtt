coming<00:01:40.630> from<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.869> think<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.259> off<00:01:41.530> ball<00:01:41.800> work

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
coming from I think is off ball work

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.820 
coming from I think is off ball work
needs<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.310> lot<00:01:42.459> I<00:01:42.840> love<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.289> awful<00:01:44.560> ball<00:01:44.679> game

defending<00:01:45.250> me<00:01:45.399> yeah<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.640> don't<00:01:45.729> think<00:01:45.910> he

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970

tracks<00:01:46.149> back<00:01:46.300> up<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.539> think<00:01:46.690> sort<00:01:46.869> of<00:01:46.959> when<00:01:47.440> he

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
tracks back up I think sort of when he

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.600 
tracks back up I think sort of when he
doesn't<00:01:47.679> have<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.860> ball<00:01:48.039> he<00:01:48.220> does<00:01:48.369> them

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
to go around but I think I'm more

important<00:01:55.509> will<00:01:55.660> probably<00:01:55.899> be<00:01:55.989> like<00:01:56.110> the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
important will probably be like the

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.430 
important will probably be like the
cultural<00:01:56.649> difference<00:01:57.640> between<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.869> Spanish

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
cultural difference between the Spanish

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.859 
cultural difference between the Spanish
and<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.979> British<00:02:00.340> if<00:02:00.459> you<00:02:00.550> want<00:02:00.729> your<00:02:01.149> best

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
and the British if you want your best

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.290 
and the British if you want your best
mates<00:02:02.280> bought<00:02:03.280> em<00:02:03.459> and<00:02:04.090> they're<00:02:04.179> not<00:02:04.239> very

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
mates bought em and they're not very

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.630

alike<00:02:04.660> at<00:02:04.750> all<00:02:04.840> no<00:02:05.289> not<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.709> all<00:02:05.770> isn't<00:02:06.160> what<00:02:06.610> I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
alike at all no not at all isn't what I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.279 
alike at all no not at all isn't what I
think<00:02:06.849> a<00:02:07.119> British<00:02:07.720> burger<00:02:07.899> gone<00:02:08.050> off<00:02:08.170> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
think a British burger gone off the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.260 
think a British burger gone off the
plane<00:02:08.440> Spade<00:02:08.709> I'm<00:02:09.039> assuming<00:02:09.610> he's<00:02:09.729> sorted<00:02:10.119> for

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
plane Spade I'm assuming he's sorted for

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.640 
plane Spade I'm assuming he's sorted for
you<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.479> he's<00:02:10.569> not<00:02:10.599> talking<00:02:10.899> about<00:02:11.319> him<00:02:11.500> I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
you and he's not talking about him I

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.839 
you and he's not talking about him I
think<00:02:11.709> they're<00:02:12.069> automatically<00:02:12.520> better<00:02:12.700> try

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
think they're automatically better try

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.030 
think they're automatically better try
and<00:02:12.940> get<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.120> back<00:02:13.269> when<00:02:13.629> he<00:02:14.620> starts<00:02:14.860> like

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and get this back when he starts like

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.710 
and get this back when he starts like
making<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> smallest<00:02:15.879> mistakes<00:02:16.360> because

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
making the smallest mistakes because

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.119 
making the smallest mistakes because
that's<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.379> would<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.769> mean<00:02:17.980> if

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
that's it's like you would I mean if

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.759 
that's it's like you would I mean if
someone<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.879> don't<00:02:19.420> know<00:02:19.629> if<00:02:20.290> anything<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.590> fair

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
someone I don't know if anything is fair

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.440 
someone I don't know if anything is fair
I<00:02:20.830> came<00:02:20.980> over<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> League<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.700> Ireland<00:02:21.910> and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
I came over to the League of Ireland and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.670 
I came over to the League of Ireland and
he<00:02:22.750> was<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.640> lot<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> money<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.240> yeah<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:26.590> like

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
he was a lot of money we yeah but like

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.990 
he was a lot of money we yeah but like
he's<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.830> same<00:02:26.980> thing<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.280> mean<00:02:27.310> if<00:02:27.520> two<00:02:27.850> people

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
he's the same thing I mean if two people

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.100 
he's the same thing I mean if two people
are<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.240> culturally<00:02:28.660> different<00:02:28.780> than<00:02:29.020> they

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
are so culturally different than they

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.140 
are so culturally different than they
have<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.530> history<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.610> past<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:30.970> they

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
have that history in the past so they

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.670 
have that history in the past so they
I<00:02:31.180> think<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.019> good<00:02:32.110> chance<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.409> say<00:02:32.560> but

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
I think it's a good chance to say but

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.470 
I think it's a good chance to say but
maybe<00:02:32.920> that's<00:02:33.159> what<00:02:33.670> we'll<00:02:33.819> have<00:02:33.849> like<00:02:34.269> that's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
maybe that's what we'll have like that's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.039 
maybe that's what we'll have like that's
what's<00:02:34.629> gonna<00:02:34.720> happen

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
what's gonna happen

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.509 
what's gonna happen
yeah<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:35.439> friction<00:02:35.739> there<00:02:35.890> then<00:02:36.310> for

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
yeah we friction there then for

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.670 
yeah we friction there then for
potential<00:02:36.970> consequences<00:02:37.689> those<00:02:38.079> Gareth<00:02:38.560> Bale

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
potential consequences those Gareth Bale

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.990 
potential consequences those Gareth Bale
committed<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.069> stronger<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:39.819> number

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
committed is stronger we see number

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.250 
committed is stronger we see number
moderate<00:02:40.299> she<00:02:40.420> was<00:02:40.569> pro<00:02:40.780> with<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.019> worst

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
moderate she was pro with the worst

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.960 
moderate she was pro with the worst
player<00:02:41.470> ever<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.769> think<00:02:41.980> yes<00:02:42.189> pretty<00:02:42.670> amazing

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
player ever I think yes pretty amazing

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.309 
player ever I think yes pretty amazing
yeah<00:02:43.209> that's<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> fruit<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.260> just

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
yeah that's the fruit and it's just just

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.390 
yeah that's the fruit and it's just just
ridiculous<00:02:44.709> when<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:44.829> think<00:02:44.890> about<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.280> or

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
ridiculous when you think about it or

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.630 
ridiculous when you think about it or
does<00:02:45.939> he<00:02:45.970> fly<00:02:46.870> back<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.110> England<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.640> think

does he fly back to England I think

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.880 
does he fly back to England I think
