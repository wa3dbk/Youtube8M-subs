town<00:00:54.370> we're<00:00:54.610> in<00:00:54.640> we're<00:00:55.059> in<00:00:55.149> Southern

town we're in we're in Southern
California<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:56.469> think<00:00:57.100> this<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.519> Santa<00:00:58.000> Ana<00:00:58.239> or

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
California I think this is Santa Ana or

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.209 
California I think this is Santa Ana or
maybe<00:00:59.050> orange<00:01:00.300> either<00:01:01.300> Santa<00:01:01.899> Ana<00:01:02.110> or<00:01:02.500> orange

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
maybe orange either Santa Ana or orange

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.070 
maybe orange either Santa Ana or orange
it's<00:01:03.460> at<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.730> outlet<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.390> orange<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:04.899> guess

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
it's at the outlet of orange so I guess

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
it would be in Orange the outlets of

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.109 
it would be in Orange the outlets of
orange<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.100> orange<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.520> would<00:01:09.790> make<00:01:09.970> it

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
orange and orange that would make it

orange and orange that would make it
probably<00:01:10.750> orange<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.649> orange<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:13.180> my

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330
