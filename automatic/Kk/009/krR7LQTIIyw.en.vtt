00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
concentration in your blood you have to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.060 
concentration in your blood you have to
go<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> hyperbaric<00:01:34.290> chamber<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.860> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
go to the hyperbaric chamber and have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.730 
go to the hyperbaric chamber and have
oxygen<00:01:35.700> therapy<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
oxygen therapy and not only is that a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.380 
oxygen therapy and not only is that a
pain<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.130> butt<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> big<00:01:38.909> deal<00:01:39.119> too

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
pain in the butt but it's a big deal too

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.390 
pain in the butt but it's a big deal too
so<00:01:40.020> make<00:01:40.200> sure<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.829> any<00:01:41.070> carbon

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
so make sure you don't have any carbon

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.200 
so make sure you don't have any carbon
monoxide<00:01:42.290> smoke<00:01:43.290> detectors<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.090> most

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
monoxide smoke detectors I think in most

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
monoxide smoke detectors I think in most
fire<00:01:45.479> departments<00:01:45.509> they'll<00:01:46.200> give<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.619> out

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
fire departments they'll give them out

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
fire departments they'll give them out
free<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.250> you're<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.670> low-income<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.509> in

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
free if you're you know low-income or in

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
free if you're you know low-income or in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
smoke detector at a fire station they'll

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.090 
smoke detector at a fire station they'll
just<00:01:54.240> say<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:56.579> next<00:01:56.880> thing<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:58.100> pardon

carbon<00:02:48.500> monoxide<00:02:48.620> or<00:02:49.160> other<00:02:49.280> gases<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.970> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
carbon monoxide or other gases that you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.630 
carbon monoxide or other gases that you
don't<00:02:50.600> detect<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.230> you'll<00:02:51.890> inhale<00:02:52.190> them<00:02:52.460> your

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
oxygen level will go down and you'll

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.480 
oxygen level will go down and you'll
pass<00:02:54.290> out<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.710> guess<00:02:54.980> what<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.370> you'll

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
