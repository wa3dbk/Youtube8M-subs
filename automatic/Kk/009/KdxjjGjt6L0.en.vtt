handy<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.180> can<00:01:19.420> clamp<00:01:19.660> from<00:01:19.900> both<00:01:20.170> sides<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:24.040> I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
handy I can clamp from both sides well I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.980 
handy I can clamp from both sides well I
take<00:01:24.370> that<00:01:24.430> work<00:01:24.850> out<00:01:25.090> of<00:01:25.270> there<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.450> make<00:01:25.750> sure

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
take that work out of there I make sure

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.090 
take that work out of there I make sure
it<00:01:26.170> doesn't<00:01:26.410> wiggle<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:28.480> it<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.560> got<00:01:30.070> a

it doesn't wiggle and it is it is got a

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.740 
it doesn't wiggle and it is it is got a
little<00:01:30.160> bit<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.580> squiggle<00:01:31.000> here<00:01:31.030> so<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.450> got<00:01:31.660> to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
little bit of squiggle here so I got to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:47.570 
little bit of squiggle here so I got to
make<00:01:31.870> sure<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.320> doesn't<00:01:32.620> occur<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:40.270> it

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.410 

now<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.880> space<00:01:49.180> has<00:01:49.390> been<00:01:49.540> mapped<00:01:49.840> out<00:01:51.420> I'm

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
now that space has been mapped out I'm

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.880 
now that space has been mapped out I'm
going<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.720> have<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:52.900> hard<00:01:53.200> time<00:01:53.440> making<00:01:53.680> a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
going to have a hard time making a

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.460 
going to have a hard time making a
mistake<00:01:54.210> we've<00:01:55.210> got<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.570> space<00:01:55.690> mapped<00:01:56.200> out

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
mistake we've got the space mapped out

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.710 
mistake we've got the space mapped out
the<00:01:57.220> paper<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.880> work<00:01:58.060> we're<00:01:58.330> in<00:01:58.510> that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
the paper and the work we're in that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.650 
the paper and the work we're in that
space<00:01:59.430> bring<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.550> router<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:01.090> we're<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.600> to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
space bring the router in we're going to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.260 
space bring the router in we're going to
cut<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.080> data<00:02:02.260> from<00:02:02.590> both<00:02:02.860> sides<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:03.580> I'll

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
cut the data from both sides so I'll

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.790 
cut the data from both sides so I'll
waist<00:02:04.600> here<00:02:05.080> about<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.010> diameters<00:02:06.760> worth<00:02:07.800> slide

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
waist here about a diameters worth slide

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.220 
waist here about a diameters worth slide
it<00:02:08.979> out<00:02:10.440> come<00:02:11.440> back<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.680> here<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.310> just

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
it out come back in here and just

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.950 
it out come back in here and just
typewriter<00:02:14.310> waste<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.750> section<00:02:16.750> all<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
typewriter waste this section all the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.430 
typewriter waste this section all the
way<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.500> other<00:02:17.650> side<00:02:18.510> will<00:02:19.510> minimize<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
way to the other side will minimize the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.580 
way to the other side will minimize the
breakout<00:02:20.920> if<00:02:21.070> we<00:02:21.190> cut<00:02:21.460> from<00:02:21.640> both<00:02:21.820> sides<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.600> I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
breakout if we cut from both sides so I

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.800 
breakout if we cut from both sides so I
need<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.980> put<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.340> my<00:02:24.520> gear<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.030> plug<00:02:25.630> this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
need to put on my gear and plug this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:03:00.429 
need to put on my gear and plug this
tool<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.640> we'll<00:02:27.850> make<00:02:28.060> some<00:02:28.270> chips

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.270 

before<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.469> undo<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.129> template<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.700> inspect<00:03:04.280> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
before I undo the template I inspect the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.160 
before I undo the template I inspect the
dado<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.730> make<00:03:06.090> sure<00:03:06.299> there's<00:03:06.510> no<00:03:06.599> chips<00:03:06.959> on

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
dado and make sure there's no chips on

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.860 
dado and make sure there's no chips on
the<00:03:07.290> edge<00:03:07.469> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> template<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:09.480> there<00:03:09.719> are

the edge of the template if there are

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.449 
the edge of the template if there are
that<00:03:10.139> meant<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.560> bearing<00:03:10.920> bounced<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> little

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
that meant the bearing bounced a little

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.789 
that meant the bearing bounced a little
bit<00:03:12.019> also<00:03:13.019> note<00:03:13.469> that<00:03:13.499> the<00:03:13.920> cutter<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.409> lot

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
bit also note that the cutter is a lot

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.849 
bit also note that the cutter is a lot
smaller<00:03:17.250> than<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.849> slot<00:03:18.840> which<00:03:19.230> means<00:03:19.560> one

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
smaller than the slot which means one

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.369 
smaller than the slot which means one
cutter<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.579> good<00:03:21.569> for<00:03:21.840> all<00:03:22.049> different

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
cutter is good for all different

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.789 
cutter is good for all different
thicknesses<00:03:23.719> stand<00:03:24.719> a<00:03:24.900> little<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.379> flash

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
thicknesses stand a little of that flash

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:35.869 
thicknesses stand a little of that flash
over<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:35.159> so<00:03:35.370> any<00:03:35.579> width

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
over there and that's it so any width

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.580 
over there and that's it so any width
any<00:03:36.480> thickness<00:03:37.250> any<00:03:38.250> two<00:03:38.579> work<00:03:38.790> pieces<00:03:39.590> one

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
any thickness any two work pieces one

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.369 
any thickness any two work pieces one
cutter<00:03:41.540> pretty<00:03:42.540> snug<00:03:42.930> dado<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.430> that's<00:03:44.639> it

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
cutter pretty snug dado and that's it

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.869 
cutter pretty snug dado and that's it
ever<00:03:46.379> but<00:03:46.709> that's<00:03:46.889> real<00:03:47.189> nice<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.639> close

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
ever but that's real nice and close

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.550 
ever but that's real nice and close
right<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.389> in<00:03:48.480> fact<00:03:48.689> probably<00:03:49.230> won't

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
right now in fact probably won't

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.790 
right now in fact probably won't
tolerate<00:03:49.799> much<00:03:50.189> glue<00:03:50.489> at<00:03:50.639> all
