listen when you look at a face again

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.680 
listen when you look at a face again
your<00:00:16.020> brain<00:00:16.320> processes<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.550> good<00:00:18.390> bad

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
your brain processes it as good bad

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870 
your brain processes it as good bad
weird<00:00:19.109> unusual<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.400> looking<00:00:20.730> you're

capturing everything all in one minute

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.050 
capturing everything all in one minute
but<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.369> minute<00:00:23.519> probably<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.029> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
but not one minute probably in one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
but not one minute probably in one
second<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.720> staring<00:00:25.260> some<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.980> second

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
second of staring some so one second

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
second of staring some so one second
glance<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.849> her<00:00:27.000> your<00:00:27.539> brain<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> telling<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
glance at her your brain is telling you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.210 
glance at her your brain is telling you
something's<00:00:28.500> wrong<00:00:28.650> something's<00:00:28.949> out<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
something's wrong something's out of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.470 
something's wrong something's out of
balance<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.670> what's<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> balance<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.449> mean

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
balance so what's out of balance I mean

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
balance so what's out of balance I mean
is<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> proportion<00:00:31.170> issue<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:32.250> 100

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is that a proportion issue it's 100

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.889 
is that a proportion issue it's 100
percent<00:00:32.790> proportion<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.690> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
percent proportion you take it all in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.000 
percent proportion you take it all in
because<00:00:34.079> you've<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.590> staring<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
because you've been with staring it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.380 
because you've been with staring it
faces<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.399> whole<00:00:35.550> life<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
faces your whole life you know what to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
faces your whole life you know what to
expect<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.840> your<00:00:36.960> brain<00:00:37.260> subconsciously

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
expect and your brain subconsciously

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.530 
expect and your brain subconsciously
knows<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> proportions<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.420> wrong

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
knows when the proportions are wrong

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.049 
knows when the proportions are wrong
just<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> look<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> car<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.820> in

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just like when you look at a car you in

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
just like when you look at a car you in
one<00:00:42.360> second<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> car<00:00:43.500> looks<00:00:43.680> good<00:00:43.829> or

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
one second know if the car looks good or

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.139 
one second know if the car looks good or
bad<00:00:44.040> you're<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> car<00:00:44.550> designer<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
bad you're not a car designer but you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.580 
bad you're not a car designer but you
just<00:00:45.360> understand<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.230> look<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.440> her

face<00:00:46.829> her<00:00:47.250> cheeks<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> proportion

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
face her cheeks are out of proportion

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
face her cheeks are out of proportion
they're<00:00:48.480> very<00:00:48.899> large<00:00:49.230> they're<00:00:49.590> they're

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
they're very large they're they're

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
they're very large they're they're
looking<00:00:50.250> unnatural<00:00:50.399> her<00:00:51.090> nose<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> little

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
looking unnatural her nose is a little

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.049 
looking unnatural her nose is a little
bit<00:00:52.110> under<00:00:52.350> proportion<00:00:53.190> where<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> nostrils

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
bit under proportion where the nostrils

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
bit under proportion where the nostrils
themselves<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.600> small<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> nose<00:00:55.199> has<00:00:55.379> an

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
themselves are small the nose has an

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.049 
themselves are small the nose has an
unusual<00:00:55.980> point<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.550> her<00:00:56.730> lips<00:00:56.940> are

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
unusual point to it and her lips are

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.119 
unusual point to it and her lips are
looking<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.510> odd<00:00:58.230> especially<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.039> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
looking a little odd especially in that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
looking a little odd especially in that
photo<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.940> much<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.809> then

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
photo not so much in this one and then

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.510 
photo not so much in this one and then
her<00:01:01.050> eyes<00:01:01.079> probably<00:01:01.829> were<00:01:01.949> pulled<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
her eyes probably were pulled back a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
her eyes probably were pulled back a
little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.030> again<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.110> difficult<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
little bit so again it's difficult to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.230 
little bit so again it's difficult to
tell<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> previous<00:01:05.580> photo<00:01:05.850> she<00:01:06.090> was

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
tell in that previous photo she was

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
tell in that previous photo she was
smiling<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> everyone's<00:01:07.229> eyes<00:01:07.439> narrow<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
smiling and everyone's eyes narrow a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.640 
smiling and everyone's eyes narrow a
little<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.780> she's<00:01:10.200> definitely

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
little bit but you know she's definitely

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
little bit but you know she's definitely
had<00:01:10.799> work<00:01:11.040> done<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> cheeks<00:01:11.970> cheek<00:01:12.420> implants

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
had work done on cheeks cheek implants

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
had work done on cheeks cheek implants
what<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.909> silicone

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
what they are it's kind of like silicone

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
what they are it's kind of like silicone

you're putting them on bone what happens
with<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.820> over<00:01:23.909> time<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.869> face

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
with them over time is that as your face

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.920 
with them over time is that as your face
changes<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.619> absorb<00:01:25.950> bone<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.580> fat<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.659> cheek

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
changes we absorb bone and fat the cheek

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
changes we absorb bone and fat the cheek
implants<00:01:28.380> however<00:01:28.619> stay<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> where<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
implants however stay kind of where you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
implants however stay kind of where you
put<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.600> start<00:01:30.840> looking<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> little

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
put them so they start looking a little

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
put them so they start looking a little
too<00:01:31.560> much<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.880> how

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
too much like this when they go in how

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
too much like this when they go in how
do<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.509> them<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.869> well<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.590> make<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
do you get them in there well you make a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
do you get them in there well you make a
little<00:01:35.100> incision<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> eye<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.750> go

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
little incision in the eye you can go

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.999 
little incision in the eye you can go
either<00:01:37.140> through<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> mouth<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
either through the mouth but there's a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.410 
either through the mouth but there's a
couple<00:01:38.130> different<00:01:38.430> ways<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> put<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
couple different ways to put them in you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
couple different ways to put them in you
slide<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.930> where<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.890> belong

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
slide it where you think they belong

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
slide it where you think they belong
then<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.729> tack<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.210> place<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
then you kind of tack it in place and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.980 
then you kind of tack it in place and
that's<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:44.000> there's<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> lot<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> things<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that's it there's a lot of things that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.499 
that's it there's a lot of things that
happen<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:46.409> time<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> face<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:48.210> face<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
happen over time to a face your face is

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
happen over time to a face your face is
supposed<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> change<00:01:49.470> over<00:01:49.740> time<00:01:50.090> cheek

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
supposed to change over time cheek

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.719 
supposed to change over time cheek
implants<00:01:51.600> however<00:01:51.840> stay<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.740> same<00:01:53.009> volume<00:01:53.369> as

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
implants however stay the same volume as

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
implants however stay the same volume as
you<00:01:53.759> put<00:01:54.149> them<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> way<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
you put them and so they have a way of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.490 
you put them and so they have a way of
starting<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> look<00:01:55.920> unnatural<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.420> put<00:01:58.320> much

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
starting to look unnatural I put much

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.289 
starting to look unnatural I put much
prefer<00:01:58.829> filler<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.399> augmenting<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> cheek

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
prefer filler for augmenting a cheek

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
prefer filler for augmenting a cheek
because<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.750> couple<00:02:01.170> different<00:02:01.500> reasons<00:02:01.740> one

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
because a couple different reasons one

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
because a couple different reasons one
is<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> changes<00:02:03.329> over<00:02:03.450> time<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> filler

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is that it changes over time the filler

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
is that it changes over time the filler
gets<00:02:04.229> reabsorbed<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> want

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
gets reabsorbed that's what you want

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.010 
gets reabsorbed that's what you want
because<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:05.820> things<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.360> changing<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
because all things are changing so you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.889 
because all things are changing so you
don't<00:02:07.259> necessarily<00:02:07.409> need<00:02:08.160> filler

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
don't necessarily need filler

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.300 
don't necessarily need filler
permanently<00:02:09.899> where<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.229> placed<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
permanently where you placed it the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.660 
permanently where you placed it the
initial<00:02:11.670> time<00:02:11.819> with<00:02:12.599> an<00:02:12.720> implant

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
initial time with an implant

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.580 
initial time with an implant
you're<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.569> stuck<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.050> course<00:02:15.260> where<00:02:15.500> you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
you're it's stuck of course where you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
you're it's stuck of course where you
put<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.010> you're<00:02:16.370> absorbing<00:02:16.819> bone

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
put it and you're absorbing bone

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
put it and you're absorbing bone
underneath<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.750> because<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.380> whenever<00:02:18.620> an

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
underneath it because that whenever an

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.460 
underneath it because that whenever an
implant<00:02:19.370> sits<00:02:19.670> on<00:02:19.850> bone<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.750> causes<00:02:21.319> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
implant sits on bone it causes this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.870 
implant sits on bone it causes this
phenomenon<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:22.190> occur<00:02:22.220> where<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.610> bone

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
phenomenon to occur where the bone

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.210 
phenomenon to occur where the bone
actually<00:02:23.120> reabsorbs<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> bone<00:02:25.190> is

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
actually reabsorbs so if the bone is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.820 
actually reabsorbs so if the bone is
absorbing<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:25.940> implant<00:02:26.420> no<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.470> bone<00:02:27.650> is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
absorbing the implant no the bone is

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.070 
absorbing the implant no the bone is
absorbing<00:02:28.250> underneath<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.819> implant<00:02:28.970> okay<00:02:29.660> so

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
absorbing underneath the implant okay so

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.620 
absorbing underneath the implant okay so
it's<00:02:30.440> actually<00:02:30.800> changing<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.970> structure<00:02:32.300> on

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
it's actually changing the structure on

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.360 
it's actually changing the structure on
which<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.020> implant<00:02:33.350> says<00:02:33.590> oh<00:02:33.740> okay

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
which the implant says oh okay

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.830 
which the implant says oh okay
interestingly<00:02:34.610> enough<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.480> implant

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
interestingly enough so the implant

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.330 
interestingly enough so the implant
could<00:02:35.990> then<00:02:36.140> shift<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.650> little<00:02:36.770> over<00:02:37.070> time<00:02:37.190> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
could then shift a little over time and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.699 
could then shift a little over time and
again<00:02:37.490> we're<00:02:37.670> absorbing<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.330> bone<00:02:38.709> naturally

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
again we're absorbing the bone naturally

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.979 
again we're absorbing the bone naturally
also<00:02:39.950> where<00:02:40.550> they<00:02:40.700> implant<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.150> sitting<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
also where they implant is sitting so it

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.570 
also where they implant is sitting so it
can<00:02:42.140> actually<00:02:42.290> shift<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.040> start<00:02:43.250> looking

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
can actually shift and start looking

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.740 
can actually shift and start looking
like<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:43.970> pointing<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.569> wrong<00:02:44.720> direction

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
like it's pointing in a wrong direction

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.890 
like it's pointing in a wrong direction
there's<00:02:45.650> again<00:02:46.070> there's<00:02:46.940> two<00:02:47.270> cases<00:02:47.750> where

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
there's again there's two cases where

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.140 
there's again there's two cases where
implants<00:02:48.380> are<00:02:48.470> truly<00:02:48.739> necessary<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:49.640> for<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
implants are truly necessary but for the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150 
implants are truly necessary but for the
majority<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.660> cosmetic<00:02:51.080> uses<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.980> can't

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
majority of cosmetic uses I just can't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.380 
majority of cosmetic uses I just can't
stand<00:02:52.400> them<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.610> think<00:02:52.670> they<00:02:52.850> look<00:02:53.030> artificial

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
stand them I think they look artificial

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.000 
stand them I think they look artificial
and<00:02:53.660> fake<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.080> would<00:02:54.170> much<00:02:54.470> prefer<00:02:54.500> if

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
and fake and I would much prefer if

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.190 
and fake and I would much prefer if
people<00:02:55.220> stuck<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:55.580> temporary<00:02:56.330> fillers<00:02:56.630> not

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
