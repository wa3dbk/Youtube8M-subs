it<00:01:56.330> looks<00:01:56.540> like<00:01:56.750> we've<00:01:57.380> got<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.710> foundation<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
it looks like we've got a foundation to

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.210 
it looks like we've got a foundation to
your<00:01:58.850> building<00:01:59.320> also<00:02:00.320> added<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.710> fence<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.130> the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
your building also added a fence in the

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.530 
your building also added a fence in the
car<00:02:01.430> park<00:02:01.670> as<00:02:01.820> well<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.240> make<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.390> little

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
car park as well just to make a little

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.660 
car park as well just to make a little
bit<00:02:02.720> more<00:02:02.810> tidy<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.890> again<00:02:04.130> there's<00:02:04.550> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
bit more tidy and again there's the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.859 
bit more tidy and again there's the
specs<00:02:04.940> all<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.180> way<00:02:05.240> along<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.509> side<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
specs all the way along the side of the

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.270 
specs all the way along the side of the
line<00:02:05.990> which<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.290> think<00:02:06.470> adds<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.130> bit<00:02:07.250> of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
line which I think adds a bit of

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.760 
line which I think adds a bit of
interest<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.350> final<00:02:09.470> bit<00:02:09.709> of

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
interest to it and the final bit of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.590 
interest to it and the final bit of
progress<00:02:09.920> they've<00:02:10.220> had<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> bridge

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
progress they've had this is a bridge

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.020 
progress they've had this is a bridge
over<00:02:12.050> here<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:13.280> see<00:02:13.489> I've<00:02:13.580> made<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:13.880> own

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
over here you see I've made my own

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.120 
over here you see I've made my own
custom<00:02:14.510> bridge<00:02:14.959> site<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.739> making<00:02:16.070> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
custom bridge site and I was making a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.100 
custom bridge site and I was making a
buying<00:02:16.370> one<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> unusual

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
buying one but because of the unusual

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.590 
buying one but because of the unusual
shape<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.830> stuff<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.280> decided<00:02:19.640> I'd<00:02:20.269> be<00:02:20.420> better

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
shape and stuff I decided I'd be better

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.330 
shape and stuff I decided I'd be better
off<00:02:20.660> making<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.440> think<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.100> come<00:02:22.250> out

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
off making one I think it's come out

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.770 
off making one I think it's come out
pretty<00:02:22.580> well<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:22.790> my<00:02:23.030> first<00:02:23.269> attempts<00:02:23.660> at

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
pretty well for my first attempts at

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.530 
pretty well for my first attempts at
building<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.530> bridge<00:02:24.709> side<00:02:24.980> also<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.390> see

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
building a bridge side also you can see

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.170 
building a bridge side also you can see
in<00:02:26.690> there<00:02:26.900> I've<00:02:27.170> got<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> concrete<00:02:28.489> sides<00:02:28.880> as

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
in there I've got the concrete sides as

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.130 
in there I've got the concrete sides as
well<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> tunnel<00:02:30.040> or<00:02:31.040> bridge<00:02:31.310> rather<00:02:31.640> and

I've had some small stones in here as

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.770 
I've had some small stones in here as
well<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.760> looks<00:02:53.060> quite<00:02:53.239> good<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.660> will

well it looks quite good so this will
eventually<00:02:54.110> be<00:02:54.200> filled<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.030> woodland

for<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.650> very<00:03:00.709> deep<00:03:00.980> river<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.640> be<00:03:01.730> quite

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
for a very deep river and to be quite

it's summertime and there's not there's
much<00:03:06.739> water<00:03:07.010> around<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.489> perhaps<00:03:07.640> might<00:03:08.030> be<00:03:08.180> I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
much water around so perhaps might be I

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.380 
much water around so perhaps might be I
also<00:03:09.620> added<00:03:09.829> some<00:03:09.950> more<00:03:10.190> grass<00:03:10.400> over<00:03:10.790> here<00:03:10.820> and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
also added some more grass over here and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.330 
also added some more grass over here and
did<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> same<00:03:12.350> on<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.799> painted<00:03:13.070> this

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
did the same on this so I painted this

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.250 
did the same on this so I painted this
this<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.030> still<00:03:14.239> drawing<00:03:14.510> which<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.810> why<00:03:15.019> looks

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
this is still drawing which is why looks

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.069 
this is still drawing which is why looks
more<00:03:15.410> Brown<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:17.150> has<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> cliff<00:03:17.630> side<00:03:17.870> as

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
more Brown and this has a cliff side as

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.750 
more Brown and this has a cliff side as
well<00:03:19.209> leave<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.329> side<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.310> yeah<00:03:22.489> I'm<00:03:22.700> pretty

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
well leave the side so yeah I'm pretty

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.880 
well leave the side so yeah I'm pretty
pleased<00:03:23.150> with<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.390> progress<00:03:23.570> oh<00:03:23.900> just

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
pleased with the progress oh just

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.349 
pleased with the progress oh just
remember<00:03:25.040> there's<00:03:25.760> one<00:03:25.820> other<00:03:26.030> thing<00:03:26.239> I've

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
remember there's one other thing I've

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.630 
remember there's one other thing I've
done<00:03:26.450> as<00:03:26.600> well<00:03:26.769> I've<00:03:27.769> added<00:03:27.950> at<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.459> back<00:03:28.609> of

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
done as well I've added at the back of

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.610 
done as well I've added at the back of
the<00:03:28.820> bridge<00:03:29.030> as<00:03:29.150> well<00:03:29.299> along<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.079> edge<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
the bridge as well along the edge of the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.819 
the bridge as well along the edge of the
track<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.190> makes<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.120> look<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.269> bit<00:03:32.329> more

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
track just makes it look a bit more

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.800 
track just makes it look a bit more
realistic<00:03:33.829> but<00:03:34.519> more<00:03:34.730> custom

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
realistic but more custom

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.289 
realistic but more custom
rather<00:03:36.350> than<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.739> gluing<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.220> bridge<00:03:37.880> side<00:03:38.090> to

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
rather than just gluing a bridge side to

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.870 
rather than just gluing a bridge side to
the<00:03:38.390> side<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.750> MDF<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.250> joined

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
the side of the MDF and that is joined

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.060 
the side of the MDF and that is joined
onto<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.269> fence<00:03:41.510> here<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.989> works<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:42.890> way

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
onto this fence here and works this way

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.420 
onto this fence here and works this way
all<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.519> way<00:03:43.640> down<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.970> line<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.859> then<00:03:46.340> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
all the way down the line and then the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.030 
all the way down the line and then the
fence<00:03:46.609> curves<00:03:46.910> off<00:03:47.120> here<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.590> will<00:03:48.829> bring

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
fence curves off here and I will bring

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.610 
fence curves off here and I will bring
it<00:03:49.100> all<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.340> way<00:03:49.430> across<00:03:49.810> into<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:50.930> area<00:03:51.350> it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it all the way across into this area it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.830 
it all the way across into this area it
just<00:03:51.680> stops<00:03:52.040> there<00:03:52.220> at<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.370> moment<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.840> put

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
just stops there at the moment I put

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.360 
just stops there at the moment I put
some<00:03:53.989> grass<00:03:54.199> there<00:03:54.500> as<00:03:54.620> well<00:03:54.769> this<00:03:54.919> area<00:03:55.100> was

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
some grass there as well this area was

there last time
we've<00:03:58.340> been<00:03:58.519> quite<00:03:58.639> a<00:03:58.699> lot<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:58.940> progress

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.679 

they're<00:04:04.219> still<00:04:04.430> fairly<00:04:04.849> long<00:04:05.120> way<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.299> go<00:04:05.510> for

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
they're still fairly long way to go for

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
pieces obviously small bushes definitely

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.440 
pieces obviously small bushes definitely
larger<00:04:12.019> bushes<00:04:12.170> huge<00:04:13.069> near<00:04:13.819> growths<00:04:14.239> of

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
larger bushes huge near growths of

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
turkey on this side I also still need to

paint the rest of the detail on that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.830 
paint the rest of the detail on that
cliff<00:04:21.229> face<00:04:21.520> all<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.580> all<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.180> basic<00:04:23.539> scenery

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
cliff face all in all the basic scenery

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.379 
cliff face all in all the basic scenery
is<00:04:23.960> done<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.979> I'm<00:04:25.100> very<00:04:25.130> happy<00:04:25.460> with<00:04:25.639> how<00:04:26.120> they

is done and I'm very happy with how they

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.430 
is done and I'm very happy with how they
off<00:04:26.539> a<00:04:26.660> whole<00:04:27.020> area<00:04:27.229> looks<00:04:28.990> looks<00:04:29.990> pretty<00:04:30.259> good

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
off a whole area looks looks pretty good

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.760 
off a whole area looks looks pretty good
I<00:04:30.590> think

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.500 

need<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.340> paint<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> back<00:04:33.760> scene<00:04:34.000> as<00:04:34.150> well<00:04:34.300> so

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
need to paint the back scene as well so

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.120 
need to paint the back scene as well so
ever<00:04:34.690> finish<00:04:35.110> painting<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.560> has<00:04:35.830> just<00:04:35.979> going

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
ever finish painting that has just going

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.100 
ever finish painting that has just going
to<00:04:36.190> be<00:04:36.250> painted<00:04:36.580> flame<00:04:36.820> blue<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.080> eye

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
to be painted flame blue so that the eye

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.620 
to be painted flame blue so that the eye
isn't<00:04:38.440> distracted<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.280> those<00:04:39.970> foxes<00:04:40.479> and

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
isn't distracted to those foxes and

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.930 
isn't distracted to those foxes and
things<00:04:40.870> behind<00:04:41.190> thanks<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.400> area<00:04:42.669> look<00:04:42.910> a

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
things behind thanks to the area look a

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.360 
things behind thanks to the area look a
bit<00:04:43.120> more<00:04:43.270> realistic<00:04:43.800> also<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.860> bit<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.160> tidy

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
bit more realistic also a bit of a tidy

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.930 
bit more realistic also a bit of a tidy
up<00:04:45.460> up<00:04:45.669> there<00:04:45.850> is<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.060> bit<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.930> mess<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:48.760> may

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
up up there is a bit of a mess so it may

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.550 
up up there is a bit of a mess so it may
not<00:04:49.120> look<00:04:49.330> particularly<00:04:49.810> tidy<00:04:50.169> but<00:04:50.350> believe

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
not look particularly tidy but believe

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.010 
not look particularly tidy but believe
me<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:50.949> a<00:04:51.040> lot<00:04:51.190> better<00:04:51.310> than<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.060> was<00:04:53.850> so<00:04:55.020> yeah

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
me it's a lot better than it was so yeah

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.980 
me it's a lot better than it was so yeah
that<00:04:56.290> concludes<00:04:56.740> my<00:04:57.100> update<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.419> get<00:04:58.960> a

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
that concludes my update and to get a

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.290 
that concludes my update and to get a
bit<00:04:59.169> more<00:04:59.350> done<00:05:00.190> in<00:05:00.310> this<00:05:00.400> area<00:05:00.460> perhaps<00:05:01.030> next

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
bit more done in this area perhaps next

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.379 
bit more done in this area perhaps next
time<00:05:01.419> we'll<00:05:02.020> this<00:05:02.169> area<00:05:02.440> up<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.800> more<00:05:02.919> and

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
time we'll this area up a bit more and

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.240 
time we'll this area up a bit more and
continue<00:05:04.389> adding<00:05:04.750> detail<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.530> this<00:05:05.620> area<00:05:05.860> and

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
continue adding detail to this area and

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.290 
continue adding detail to this area and
as<00:05:06.310> we<00:05:06.460> get<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.639> putting<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.880> street<00:05:07.120> line

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
as we get to putting a street line

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.670 
as we get to putting a street line
outside<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.780> hotel<00:05:08.139> as<00:05:08.289> well<00:05:08.440> because<00:05:08.620> I've

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
outside the hotel as well because I've

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.390 
outside the hotel as well because I've
got<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.830> couple<00:05:09.039> of<00:05:09.190> leftover<00:05:10.120> LEDs<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:12.100> then

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
got a couple of leftover LEDs and then

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.680 
got a couple of leftover LEDs and then
hopefully<00:05:12.580> up<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:12.910> get<00:05:13.000> some<00:05:13.120> more<00:05:13.150> track<00:05:13.479> and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
hopefully up and get some more track and

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.110 
hopefully up and get some more track and
