placement you're gonna place the trigger

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.450 
placement you're gonna place the trigger
somewhere<00:01:40.659> relatively<00:01:41.259> close<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.310> know

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
somewhere relatively close to you know

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.010 
somewhere relatively close to you know
where<00:01:42.820> you're<00:01:43.060> gonna<00:01:43.240> be<00:01:43.450> doing<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.900> glitch

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
where you're gonna be doing the glitch

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.200 
where you're gonna be doing the glitch
yet<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.770> really<00:01:45.100> doesn't<00:01:45.490> matter<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.820> mean<00:01:46.030> you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
yet it really doesn't matter I mean you

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.999 
yet it really doesn't matter I mean you
could<00:01:46.450> place<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.080> know<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.200> mile<00:01:47.560> away<00:01:47.770> if

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
could place it you know a mile away if

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.920 
could place it you know a mile away if
you<00:01:48.130> wanted<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.580> but<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:49.060> suppose<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.689> really

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
you wanted to but I suppose it really

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.600 
you wanted to but I suppose it really
wouldn't<00:01:50.140> make<00:01:50.320> much<00:01:50.530> sense<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:51.100> we're

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
wouldn't make much sense and we're

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.730 
wouldn't make much sense and we're
really<00:01:52.090> not<00:01:52.240> trying<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.659> go<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.049> far<00:01:53.290> anyways

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
really not trying to go that far anyways

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440 
really not trying to go that far anyways
but<00:01:54.220> after<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.520> place<00:01:54.700> your<00:01:54.729> trigger<00:01:55.090> take

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
but after you place your trigger take

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.480 
but after you place your trigger take
your<00:01:55.630> lobby<00:01:55.869> camera<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.829> know<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.310> all

before and then you're gonna place your
steam<00:02:04.930> start<00:02:05.320> points<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:06.100> know<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.610> put

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
steam start points you know you can put

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.339 
steam start points you know you can put
them<00:02:06.880> all<00:02:06.970> right<00:02:07.329> in<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.540> row<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.960> make<00:02:08.170> sure

them all right in a row and make sure

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.410 
them all right in a row and make sure
all<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.769> arrows<00:02:09.159> are<00:02:09.369> facing<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:10.239> the

all of the arrows are facing to the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.910 
all of the arrows are facing to the
right<00:02:10.629> and<00:02:11.079> obviously<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.590> know<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.769> got<00:02:11.890> a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
right and obviously you know you got a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800 
right and obviously you know you got a
place<00:02:12.189> one<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.579> every<00:02:12.760> team<00:02:12.970> team<00:02:13.299> one<00:02:13.599> team

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
place one for every team team one team

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.229 
place one for every team team one team
two<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.559> three<00:02:15.129> and<00:02:15.279> four<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.669> you<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.969> one

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
two and three and four if you have one

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.729 
two and three and four if you have one
and<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:16.749> after<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.079> do<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.409> then<00:02:17.620> you're

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
and then after you do that then you're

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.350 
and then after you do that then you're
gonna<00:02:17.859> actually

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
gonna actually

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.990 
gonna actually
have<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.750> place<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.200> team<00:02:19.620> capture<00:02:20.550> points

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
have to place your team capture points

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.910 
have to place your team capture points
and<00:02:21.210> then<00:02:22.080> you're<00:02:22.200> gonna<00:02:22.350> want<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> place<00:02:22.770> your

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and then you're gonna want to place your

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920 
and then you're gonna want to place your
capture<00:02:23.400> point<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.850> top<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.540> starting

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
capture point on top of the starting

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.690 
capture point on top of the starting
point<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.770> know<00:02:25.920> whichever<00:02:26.340> team

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
point for you know whichever team

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.330 
point for you know whichever team
respectively<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.660> team<00:02:28.320> one<00:02:28.620> capture<00:02:29.100> point

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
respectively so team one capture point

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.040 
respectively so team one capture point
is<00:02:29.490> going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.850> on<00:02:30.030> top<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.570> team<00:02:30.780> one

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
is going to be on top of the team one

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.290 
is going to be on top of the team one
starting<00:02:31.530> point<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.000> forth

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
starting point and so on and so forth

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.490 
starting point and so on and so forth
you're<00:02:33.570> gonna<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.020> place<00:02:34.200> them<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you're gonna have to place them in the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.890 
you're gonna have to place them in the
exact<00:02:34.830> same<00:02:34.980> spot<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.490> every<00:02:35.910> team<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.660> is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
exact same spot for every team this is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.200 
exact same spot for every team this is
to<00:02:37.050> ensure<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.680> players<00:02:38.250> don't<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.820> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
to ensure that players don't have to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.060 
to ensure that players don't have to
move<00:02:39.420> soon<00:02:39.960> as<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> starts<00:02:40.650> you're<00:02:40.950> gonna

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
move soon as it starts you're gonna

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.670 
move soon as it starts you're gonna
start<00:02:41.430> getting<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.970> RP<00:02:42.300> immediately<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
start getting the RP immediately and you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.470 
start getting the RP immediately and you
won't<00:02:43.920> even<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.459> have<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> chance<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.270> move

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
won't even really have a chance to move

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.510 
won't even really have a chance to move
before<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.990> game<00:02:46.170> probably<00:02:46.860> ends<00:02:47.220> because

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
before the game probably ends because

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.430 
before the game probably ends because
someone<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.030> gonna<00:02:48.150> end<00:02:48.510> up<00:02:48.930> reaching<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
someone is gonna end up reaching the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.130 
someone is gonna end up reaching the
score<00:02:49.709> limit<00:02:50.070> very<00:02:50.520> quickly<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:51.959> before

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
score limit very quickly and now before

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
score limit very quickly and now before
we<00:02:52.350> get<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> testing<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.610> pretty<00:02:53.850> much

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
we get to testing it this is pretty much

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.120 
we get to testing it this is pretty much
the<00:02:54.390> final<00:02:54.660> step<00:02:55.110> go<00:02:55.320> down<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.620> capture

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the final step go down to capture

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.490 
the final step go down to capture
objects<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.900> gonna<00:02:58.050> be<00:02:58.350> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
objects and then it's just gonna be the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.860 
objects and then it's just gonna be the
security<00:02:58.920> cases<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.180> really<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.480> guess<00:03:00.750> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
security cases and it really I guess it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.060 
security cases and it really I guess it
really<00:03:01.050> doesn't<00:03:01.320> matter<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.800> want<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
really doesn't matter if you want to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.890 
really doesn't matter if you want to
change<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.580> object<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.630> you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
change what the object is you can you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.840 
change what the object is you can you

capture zone for the team and then hover

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.910 
capture zone for the team and then hover
back<00:03:17.790> over<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.510> hit<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> button<00:03:19.830> to

inside the actual capture point and on
top<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.820> starting<00:03:27.239> point<00:03:27.480> kind<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.350> not

top of the starting point kind of not
well<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:28.890> not<00:03:29.040> really<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.549> exactly

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
well it's not really going to be exactly

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.390 
well it's not really going to be exactly
on<00:03:30.269> top<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:31.140> want<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.560> kind<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.100> you

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
know like half in that circle just so

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.160 
know like half in that circle just so
they<00:03:35.250> kind<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:35.670> intersect<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.390> little<00:03:36.660> bit<00:03:36.840> but

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
I showed you how I mean that's a plus

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.500 
I showed you how I mean that's a plus
right

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
right

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.300 
right
like<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.050> said<00:04:32.110> all<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.470> got<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.800> do<00:04:32.890> after<00:04:33.220> you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
like I said all you got to do after you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.490 
like I said all you got to do after you
do<00:04:33.460> all<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:34.060> just<00:04:34.090> test<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:34.750> out<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.080> every

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
do all that is just test it out on every

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.590 
do all that is just test it out on every
team<00:04:35.770> team<00:04:36.130> one<00:04:36.400> team<00:04:36.640> two<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.240> if<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.420> have

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
team team one team two and if you have

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.350 
team team one team two and if you have
them<00:04:37.810> three<00:04:38.110> four<00:04:38.470> five<00:04:38.860> six<00:04:39.280> whatever

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
them three four five six whatever

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.140 
them three four five six whatever
either<00:04:41.290> way<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.920> glitch<00:04:42.130> works<00:04:42.430> very<00:04:42.790> fast

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
either way the glitch works very fast

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.500 
either way the glitch works very fast
you<00:04:43.390> make<00:04:43.600> about<00:04:43.870> 1,200<00:04:44.860> RP<00:04:45.430> every<00:04:46.090> single

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
you make about 1,200 RP every single

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.960 
you make about 1,200 RP every single
time<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.990> do<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.550> whole<00:04:48.580> glitch

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
time you do it and the whole glitch

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.940 
time you do it and the whole glitch
really<00:04:49.300> only<00:04:49.450> takes<00:04:49.750> about<00:04:49.900> one<00:04:50.350> minute<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.800> do

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
really only takes about one minute to do

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.950 
really only takes about one minute to do
obviously<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.880> longest<00:04:52.240> part<00:04:52.450> is<00:04:52.630> just

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
obviously the longest part is just

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.470 
obviously the longest part is just
making<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.680> if<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:54.190> have<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.460> make<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.970> but

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
making it if you have to make it but

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.780 
making it if you have to make it but
anytime<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.740> make<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.100> you<00:04:57.220> know<00:04:57.340> once<00:04:57.640> you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
anytime you make it you know once you

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.250 
anytime you make it you know once you
get<00:04:57.940> at<00:04:58.060> least<00:04:58.090> one<00:04:58.300> other<00:04:58.570> guy<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:59.050> there

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
get at least one other guy in there

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.320 
get at least one other guy in there
chances<00:04:59.800> are<00:04:59.950> when<00:05:00.160> he<00:05:00.340> sees<00:05:00.610> how<00:05:00.790> fast<00:05:01.090> he's

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
chances are when he sees how fast he's

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.970 
chances are when he sees how fast he's
getting<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.720> RP<00:05:02.110> even<00:05:02.500> if<00:05:02.590> he's<00:05:02.710> just<00:05:02.830> a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
getting the RP even if he's just a

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.290 
getting the RP even if he's just a
random<00:05:03.340> he's<00:05:03.490> not<00:05:03.640> gonna<00:05:03.790> leave<00:05:04.000> he's<00:05:04.180> gonna

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
random he's not gonna leave he's gonna

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.790 
random he's not gonna leave he's gonna
hang<00:05:04.570> out<00:05:04.690> with<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.020> for<00:05:05.230> a<00:05:05.260> little<00:05:05.380> bit<00:05:05.650> and

hang out with you for a little bit and
he's<00:05:06.220> gonna<00:05:06.340> take<00:05:06.610> advantage<00:05:06.940> of<00:05:07.150> all<00:05:07.330> that

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
he's gonna take advantage of all that

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
said after you test it for Team one you

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.590 
said after you test it for Team one you
got<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.980> test<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.340> for<00:05:12.460> every<00:05:12.790> team<00:05:13.030> after<00:05:13.450> that

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
got to test it for every team after that

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.930 
got to test it for every team after that
just<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.050> make<00:05:14.230> sure<00:05:14.260> that<00:05:15.100> it<00:05:15.280> works<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.760> you
