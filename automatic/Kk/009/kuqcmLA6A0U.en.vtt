00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
What are you heading to eat now?

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:05.494
Ddeokbokki that is spicier than the "Yeopddeok" that we had before

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.441
"Meddeok" at Beomil Station in Busan

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:14.451
Where are we?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340
I think we're lost

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.940
"Meddeok" (spicy ddeokbokki)

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.460
We should buy some "Cool Piece"

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.384
Cuz it's spicy!

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.868
I want this, not Cool Piece

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.360
Buy 2, get 1 free!

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.860
You can't have this during the challenge

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.834
But you can have it after

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:40.931
How spicy is it?

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.157
A lot!

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.640
Give us two servings of ddeokbokki

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:48.697
And one serving of fried food

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.940
I'm from America

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.565
These guys can speak Korea well

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.580
Thank you!

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.540
Thanks for the food!

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.640
Can you eat this?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.000
I can't eat this stuff

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.120
This much?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Can you have this much?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.100
No way

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:24.612
During the contest, you can't have this

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.020
Eat all of this?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.060
Yeah

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.509
Let's begin!

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.920
It's spicy

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.125
It's not spicier than that donkatsu

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.020
I think the Yeopddeok was more delicious

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:46.164
But this is way spicier

00:01:56.212 --> 00:01:57.792
Do this in one bite?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.360
Try it in one bite

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.220
Selfie Time!

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.140
Oh spicy

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.280
And the fried food

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:14.956
Water

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720
Can't do this...

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.240
Do it, do it

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.460
I think it'll be spicy

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.740
Of course

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180
If it's not spicy, then it wouldn't be a challenge

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.481
How is it?

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:38.042
You OK?!?!

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:42.816
Have some of the yogurt!

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
Not spicier than the donkatsu

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.220
Spicy

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940
This challenge is two serving sizes

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
The amount of food is more than I realized

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280
I have to take the KTX express train tomorrow

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.780
I can't take the bus

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.540
So spicy

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720
Almost finished!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.460
My friends,

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:06.988
I'm definitely the spicy food king

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.880
I'm Korean Alex and...

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.040
If you know someone who eats spicy food better than me

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.060
Let me know

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.020
Subscribe, Comment, and Like :)

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.820
See you next time!

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:37.918
Good video, right?^^

00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:40.993
So why haven't you left a comment yet???

00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:48.147
So today, we came for the spicy 'Meddoek"

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.400
It's time to get out there and party!
