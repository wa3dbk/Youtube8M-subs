00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.000
 do you know the problem bought box 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.710
 Bananas remove the foil and want to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 it just another class crate 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 get it and it just fits 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 As gasoline it seems too many bananas 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.509
 for this class I know that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.460
 problem synonymous but I have one now 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 solution found 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.500
 So I have now only times the lid 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.010
 removed from the box then I have 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.590
 Of course, that plastic settled and 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.679
 put over the edge here and now 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.390
 I'll either grab myself in the blanket 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.390
 or I have here in others now 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.420
 look the hole I know that I'm only 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.570
 take the carton on top 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.570
 and then 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.500
 then usually in the carton on the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.500
 banana boxes 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:28.720
 Take the lid once again the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.720
 plastic out and she the foil 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.340
 and all the bananas in the box 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.070
 bananas laid without foil
