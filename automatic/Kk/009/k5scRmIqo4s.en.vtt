00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.020
 we start 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:14.210
 the week of the race of power 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.450
 iracundo goes ahead with its launch 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.030
 of campaign at full speed and bringing together 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.860
 his whole team achieves that the 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.380
 constitution recognizes the right to 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.539
 freedom if then we can not circulate 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.880
 through the streets or leave our homes 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.039
 alone for fear of being assaulted by 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.050
 rapid 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.420
 the people in these years with the intention 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.610
 to repeal a law ratified twice 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.430
 by the Uruguayans with their vote 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.800
 that led the country to lose more than a year 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.440
 without discussions so that finally the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.629
 justice told him what is evident 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.690
 that was unconstitutional 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 a ruler can never be unaware of what 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.530
 that we Uruguayans vote for and less less 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.199
 can justified by saying the people 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.479
 sure not always the majorities have 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.479
 have the last word in a 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.049
 democracy because majorities can be 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.650
 wrong the almost that came out at the crossroads and 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.890
 not exactly to smoke the pipe of the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.200
 peace not because the right has failed 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.640
 and have nothing credible and sustainable that 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.909
 offer effectively is like that but we do not 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 like comparisons or enjoy 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.100
 with the misfortune 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.640
 lie but the first lady wore 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.880
 although she is more shy, she does not lose 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.430
 stepped into the vice presidency and reaffirms 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.430
 his fidelity to the cacique 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.880
 Garcia 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.880
 where did it go 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.090
 let's fight for the now president 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:19.280
 but if the formula lacalle president 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.440
 President 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.900
 both the handsome larraÃ±aga continues in the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.930
 trench but it does not stop showing its 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.520
 game although this week may not have 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.250
 been the best to play that letter them 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.870
 we respond to the militarization of all the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.180
 police but yes that the police have a 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.190
 military component 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.430
 which can be precisely this guard 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.100
 national that we are also reforming the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.230
 miracle record a policy that has 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.000
 to be necessarily heavy-handed 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
 against the crime you want not 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.530
 having a militarized police I think 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.210
 which is not knowing the police the police 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.640
 he killed a tough 18 year old 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.720
 the pursuit of alleged rapids this 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.030
 kind of things from here he authored the year 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.740
 Next we will leave ten 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.250
 minutes so I do not worry 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.160
 too 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.080
 a new candidate appears 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.700
 independent that is not other than pablito 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.720
 the optimist that some doubt in 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.300
 take seriously so much that how many people you 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.550
 he asks if he is seriously in jorge already 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.050
 are accustomed that at the beginning the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:41.300
 idea occurred to me more than a month ago 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:45.739
 that I am putting together a community and that is 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.959
 the proposal of what is the proposal in 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.080
 concrete the proposal the idea is the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.590
 person who behaves badly in any 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.209
 scale you can not go to punish him for 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.040
 learn then instead of punishing 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.530
 help him understand that he is much better 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.570
 coexist that the work is not a 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.640
 martyrdom do not go to work and come 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.900
 after eight hours and go to your house 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.209
 angry 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.980
 the hit and flyer with the arrogance of 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.200
 thought without you cheap looking the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.720
 rest of the average citizen like 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.840
 a rare mixture terrorism tenderness 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.229
 understanding and contempt while the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.300
 optimist says he does not have aspirations 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:26.720
 wants to discuss as equals with the 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.289
 political establishment and goes out to bar 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.180
 very hard the country is the politicians with 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.970
 all respect and I'll try if I 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.440
 allow me to discuss with them I will try 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.800
 of not being aggressive but I think that 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.550
 the types should change profession 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.830
 and details are hurting what 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.479
 they propose are inhuman things 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.880
 from the hippismo we have risen by 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.110
 about the strict social hypocrisy and 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.510
 we can see what it is that leads to 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.070
 poor seats alienated like you to 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.750
 live in this neurosis but the 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.389
 I invite to discuss with pablito first 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.539
 that without unbearable and one goes through 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:07.250
 different states want to close the 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:10.240
 pill wants to convince you embrace 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.240
 and what's up 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.919
 of shit that I make of my speech that is 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.960
 what leads to the skill this 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.610
 basically yes I learned to try that 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.190
 when someone kicked me out 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.270
 try a flower in the past to be 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.560
 metaphorical and simple that's the important thing 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.060
 Now I'm going to ask you a favor, do not tell me 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.060
 they help to fly but as not 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.120
 and as well as showing gratitude the 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.600
 hippie engine has received the boost that 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.300
 need to keep flying 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.160
 and a new chapter of the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:54.360
 power race because I need cable 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.360
 only one
