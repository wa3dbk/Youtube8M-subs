00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.400
 how are the squat sambil and 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.560
 well then I show you another accessory 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.769
 more this one that is for the playstation and 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.170
 playstation one that the light gun 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.550
 made by white for playstation or 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.990
 not around the years have they pulled this 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.530
 kind of accessories for different 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.050
 consoles 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.380
 it seems that the first gun of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.530
 light or shotgun but it seems that it was 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.410
 of magnavox and fight and each console has 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.350
 come out with this accessory although they are not 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 many games are from 1 to 5 that can 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.770
 be that they can be compatible but not 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.230
 completely and then not good option 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.850
 because yesterday the machines 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.580
 obviously you are going to find some 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.030
 maquinita and shot like now that 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.289
 is very 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 very sight what is the kirchner lc 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.710
 that is the deer house and all that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.870
 but this then that of something more different 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.299
 because obviously you use it in the 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.670
 house and then for the game you want 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.530
 but that is compatible and good 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 there is the light gun made by narco 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.909
 in 1996 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.380
 a big gun does not have much 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 emotionally big 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.719
 and well, let's go over it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 in this part, we only have the 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:31.740
 trigger here on the button to this part 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.310
 we have another button that you see 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.229
 this kind of buttons is for recharging 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 I'll do shoot on the part of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.640
 outside to recharge almost the majority of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.090
 games are like a guy 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 similar to house is from but this is from 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 like police something like that 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.630
 and so after something 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.280
 something very strange of this kind of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 accessories because it's light gun 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.320
 very few games that count 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.149
 compatibility with this accessory one of 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.209
 them is this which is the Time Crisis 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.840
 obviously that came with this weapon or the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.420
 I came to buy separately 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.750
 jose of such a crisis is something comes out for the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.069
 playstation one looks like sticks and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.579
 obviously for the 3 also 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.640
 if it is compatible with more with the gun 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.770
 because it did not come with any 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.690
 control symbol and everything is in this 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.760
 part that we have here that is compatible 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.520
 with the condom 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.340
 play with iu 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.420
 entertaining game something difficult because already 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.570
 you are advancing certain level 4 levels and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.180
 5 is something a little more difficult 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.180
 but but if it's something entertaining 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.659
 I would tell you that it is something but also many 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.060
 Sometimes it depends on the television class 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.220
 because there are oval televisions that yes 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.010
 they get it right but there are others that are 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.159
 more square socks in the part of 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.439
 in front of what is the screen and 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:18.230
 maybe it has distortion in the aspect of 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:21.019
 what is light 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.000
 this light gun is something strange 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.239
 because it comes to connect 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.780
 directly to the playstation but it's coming 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.750
 with a cable attached to that can be 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.790
 connect to the TV next 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.580
 being this this you connect in the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.060
 playstation in the control part but 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.160
 right now in the same control the same 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.760
 control cable comes this cable quoted 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.319
 that the sky is coming this connects 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.019
 and do the part in front of the 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.900
 television for audio video is this one 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.900
 you connect it on TV and connect it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.440
 which is the audio performance output 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.329
 video here then it seems that with this one 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.299
 can capture the local light 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.220
 shoot him in the game is something very 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.129
 I miss the first time I see something like that 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.780
 because the different guns already 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.100
 that have come out then obviously that 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.770
 they come with 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.980
 with the most with the connector and others 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.560
 ages to connect 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.760
 but if it is something entertaining this game 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.000
 there is another compatible game that 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.240
 out there he wanted to get it but I 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.990
 it was difficult but to see later that 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.080
 is to receive a suv iwork that is that 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.260
 something similar to shooting is somewhat slow 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.729
 for me a video from a friend here who 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.279
 sixth to three and 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.620
 and I think that game is the one that 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.040
 referred 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.050
 and only two can 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.570
 is the game of what is achieved but 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.150
 I did not go back there in a 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.690
 store that had several various games of 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.240
 playstation 1 and 2 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.820
 so it was difficult but good 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.370
 another game that is die hard 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.850
 trilogy that is also compatible not to 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.330
 100% but if there are some levels that 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.400
 you have to use the light gun 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.830
 and well, this is a small video of 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.289
 this accessory and good see you for the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.470
 next the next one and see you later 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.470
 Thank you
