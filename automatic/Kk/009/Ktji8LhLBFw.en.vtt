00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.520
 the barsa de guardiola is the feeling of the season 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.809
 It is enough that Roberto Carlos has there declared that he never saw a 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.570
 a team like that is not a Madridista confessed 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.150
 Brazilian 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.119
 in expelling himself has no implication or could have dodged 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.329
 the question in a simple way 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.239
 and yet Roberto Carlos gets wet once is the clairvoyance 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.909
 the barsa right now makes a dynamic football 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:36.050
 very much speed enamored disbola the opposites ridicules him in certain 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.340
 meaning with all due respect 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.570
 but without a level of ball speed a football philosophy a criterion 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.320
 that makes it far superior to the others pressing up and then over 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 when things get ugly they have the individuality they have the details 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.900
 that make the difference to start the ball with piquÃ© i comarques 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.180
 barsa hagen was superior and they make the exit of the ball and that makes 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.670
 that the ball always arrives in advantage to the top players when you take out 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.850
 the ball back 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 you generate imbalance in the adversary forces what good to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.790
 that that the opposing defense vascular attack 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.039
 have problems 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.459
 and then on top of the ball when it reaches messi or henry or high or 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.349
 Iniesta can not get help from the opposing team then that's for them 

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:23.300
 It is a gift fallen from heaven 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.790
 then the right wing does not alves messi 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.650
 Brazilian plus Argentinian 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.150
 US player 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.780
 of a tremendous journey like dani alves anaerobic up and down tours of 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 40 meters I do not think there's any like him in it 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.609
 in the world 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.929
 probably ma and with the inter is a right side of comallo solidity 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:43.690
 what alves 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.110
 but for barsa football there is no better player than dani alves in the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.850
 right lateral and then messi goes away of wants when it wants and where it gives to the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.140
 abandonment messi is a different player and if on top he has the accompaniment of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 team 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.230
 because it makes the right band the barsa then the best in the world and very 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.330
 difficult for any coach to stop it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.740
 then the distribution inside chari 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.690
 I never lose a ball iniesta nor very difficult to take the ball from them 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.569
 when a team next to warm and after difficult to remove the ball 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.450
 because it makes you 2 3 minutes to the sound of them and end up by despairing quiaca 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.499
 disappearing gaps and then 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.799
 the quality of everything and henry very sweet moment facing goal 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.439
 eto'o gets a lot of henry is getting like he's playing 9 and that makes 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.139
 that the barsa goes an average of almost three goals per season per game 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.089
 yes they defend well 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.830
 if you close the goal if it is difficult to score goals and you three 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.880
 it is clear that you win very easy chad from another thing at the moment he the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.059
 barsa has problems in the strategy 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.899
 then to see how they cover the palave alves and suffers all aspects of the game 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.269
 as food and this 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.599
 but for now we will see what happens here at the end 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.840
 candidates to the triplet as the Manchester candidates for everything that 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.900
 remove the danced and the recognition in advance a barsa that has marked 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.349
 the difference this year 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.649
 and that has made everyone enjoy the future
