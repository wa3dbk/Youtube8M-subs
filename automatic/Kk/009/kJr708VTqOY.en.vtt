so<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> was<00:00:36.030> kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.239> happy<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so I was kind of happy about that but I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.960 
so I was kind of happy about that but I
got<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> triple<00:00:38.219> play<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:39.410> step<00:00:40.410> back

open this that's just the sleeve on the
front<00:00:47.180> I<00:00:47.270> like<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.720> think<00:00:47.930> it's<00:00:48.080> pretty<00:00:48.320> cool

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.320 

I<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:01.510> hoping<00:01:02.469> this<00:01:03.370> would<00:01:03.519> be<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.730> bit<00:01:03.910> cheaper

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
I was hoping this would be a bit cheaper

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.520 
I was hoping this would be a bit cheaper
than<00:01:04.449> what<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.720> was<00:01:04.839> because<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:05.320> their

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
than what it was because on their

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.719 
than what it was because on their
website<00:01:05.950> saying<00:01:06.430> if<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:06.940> was<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.590> 14<00:01:08.590> but<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.190> paid

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
website saying if it was a 14 but I paid

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.850 
website saying if it was a 14 but I paid
18<00:01:10.360> for<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.690> so<00:01:10.900> that's<00:01:11.049> kind<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.409> shame<00:01:11.619> that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
18 for it so that's kind of shame that

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.149 
18 for it so that's kind of shame that
can't<00:01:12.820> do<00:01:13.060> much<00:01:13.210> about<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.680> anyway<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:14.950> is

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
can't do much about that anyway that is
