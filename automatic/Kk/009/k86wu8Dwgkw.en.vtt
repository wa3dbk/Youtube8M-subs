lazuli because really what you could do

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.370 
lazuli because really what you could do
with<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.060> mine<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> ore<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.230> can

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
with it is you can mine the ore you can

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200 
with it is you can mine the ore you can
make<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> into<00:00:25.769> blocks<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.490> creativeness

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
make it into blocks to have creativeness

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
make it into blocks to have creativeness
and<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.140> make<00:00:28.260> rooms<00:00:28.859> blue<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and they can all make rooms blue and you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
and they can all make rooms blue and you
can<00:00:30.179> color<00:00:30.330> sheep<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> world

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
can color sheep not really want a world

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.340

of<00:00:32.250> blue<00:00:32.790> sheep<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.300> right<00:00:33.450> ahead<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.170> think

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
of blue sheep go right ahead but I think

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
of blue sheep go right ahead but I think
you<00:00:34.469> should<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.739> more<00:00:34.920> uses<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.370> laps<00:00:35.760> Zoe

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you should have more uses for laps Zoe

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.590 
you should have more uses for laps Zoe

this now it's almost done and there we
go<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.350> ingot<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.850> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.760 
health as you could see and I'll
absolutely<00:02:21.030> saw<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.050> actually<00:02:22.230> does<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> lot<00:02:22.710> of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
absolutely saw it actually does a lot of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.400 
absolutely saw it actually does a lot of
damage<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.180> sword<00:02:24.480> because<00:02:24.690> lapis

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
damage for the sword because lapis

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.190 
damage for the sword because lapis
lazuli<00:02:25.470> has<00:02:26.180> more<00:02:27.180> durability<00:02:27.540> than<00:02:27.720> gold<00:02:28.020> but

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
lazuli has more durability than gold but

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
lazuli has more durability than gold but
less<00:02:28.350> than<00:02:28.380> iron<00:02:28.800> could<00:02:28.980> saying<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.460> we<00:02:29.550> got

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
less than iron could saying that we got

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.840 
less than iron could saying that we got
like<00:02:29.880> say<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.090> much<00:02:30.510> from<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.670> amount<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
like say so much from the amount of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.580 
like say so much from the amount of
lapses<00:02:33.270> we<00:02:33.450> or<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:33.870> had<00:02:33.990> those<00:02:34.110> 9<00:02:34.380> piece

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
lapses we or that we had those 9 piece

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.760 
lapses we or that we had those 9 piece
gave<00:02:34.800> us<00:02:34.890> 55<00:02:35.340> pieces<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.850> lapis<00:02:36.030> wooly<00:02:36.480> or<00:02:36.770> so

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
gave us 55 pieces of lapis wooly or so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.100 
gave us 55 pieces of lapis wooly or so
we<00:02:38.100> basically<00:02:38.280> got<00:02:38.640> elapsed<00:02:38.940> bla<00:02:39.240> lapis<00:02:39.720> for

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
we basically got elapsed bla lapis for

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
we basically got elapsed bla lapis for
the<00:02:40.710> amount<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.040> mined<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.550> could<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.880> why

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the amount we mined so I could see why

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
the amount we mined so I could see why
the<00:02:42.120> durability<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.780> not<00:02:42.930> as<00:02:43.050> powerful<00:02:43.230> let's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the durability is not as powerful let's

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.500 
the durability is not as powerful let's
hit<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.280> creeper<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.760> see<00:02:44.910> how<00:02:45.330> much<00:02:45.450> damage

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
hit this creeper and see how much damage

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.630 
hit this creeper and see how much damage
it<00:02:45.900> does<00:02:47.390> if<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.600> 16<00:02:49.410> points<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> damage

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
it does if that 16 points a damage

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.760 
it does if that 16 points a damage
that's<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.330> powerful<00:02:51.540> compared<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> lot

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
that's really powerful compared to a lot

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.350 
that's really powerful compared to a lot
of<00:02:52.800> other<00:02:52.980> swords<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.520> stuff<00:02:53.670> that's<00:02:54.090> really

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
of other swords and stuff that's really

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.820 
of other swords and stuff that's really
powerful<00:02:54.600> for<00:02:54.960> sword<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:55.650> see<00:02:55.740> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
powerful for sword as you can see the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.100 
powerful for sword as you can see the
durability<00:02:56.160> did<00:02:56.970> go<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> bit<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.840> mean

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
durability did go down a bit but I mean

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.110 
durability did go down a bit but I mean
that's<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.040> lot<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.250> damage<00:02:59.460> for<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> sword<00:03:00.060> I

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
that's a lot of damage for a sword I

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.580 
that's a lot of damage for a sword I

mean you craft a lot of swords made for

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.110 
mean you craft a lot of swords made for
your<00:03:01.650> mod<00:03:01.860> world<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.310> want<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.580> do<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.910> I

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
your mod world you want to do this I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.220 
your mod world you want to do this I
don't<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.540> would<00:03:03.720> use<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.110> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
don't know I would use this in a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.330 
don't know I would use this in a
survival<00:03:04.560> world<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.920> means<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.190> really

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
survival world it means not really

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.890 
survival world it means not really
cheating<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:05.910> adds<00:03:06.180> more<00:03:06.480> depth<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
cheating it just adds more depth to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.530 
cheating it just adds more depth to
Minecraft<00:03:07.350> let's<00:03:08.130> see<00:03:08.280> with<00:03:08.460> uh<00:03:08.490> just<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.300> shelf

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
Minecraft let's see with uh just a shelf

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.920 
Minecraft let's see with uh just a shelf
first<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.350> show<00:03:10.590> how<00:03:10.680> much<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.950> mines<00:03:11.780> see<00:03:12.780> me

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
first and show how much it mines see me

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.210 
first and show how much it mines see me
it's<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.260> as<00:03:13.410> fast<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.920> say<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:16.230> diamond<00:03:17.070> and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
it's not as fast as say like diamond and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's not as fast as say like diamond and
everything<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.240> mean<00:03:18.390> it's<00:03:18.510> still<00:03:18.630> pretty

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
everything but I mean it's still pretty

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.290 
everything but I mean it's still pretty
fast<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.620> can<00:03:19.740> just<00:03:19.890> fix<00:03:20.790> pretty<00:03:21.030> fast

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
fast so you can just fix pretty fast

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.930 
fast so you can just fix pretty fast
meet<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.840> lot<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.380> people<00:03:22.590> they<00:03:22.650> find<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.340> mean<00:03:23.820> I

know<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.150> perfect<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.750> do<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.930> find<00:03:25.410> lapis<00:03:25.620> way

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
know a perfect I do I find lapis way

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.900 
know a perfect I do I find lapis way
quicker<00:03:26.490> than<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.790> do<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.160> diamond<00:03:29.460> stuff<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.880> I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
quicker than I do and diamond stuff so I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.040 
quicker than I do and diamond stuff so I
mean<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.300> see<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.420> durably<00:03:30.720> did<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.020> down

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
mean you can see the durably did go down

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.200 
mean you can see the durably did go down
so<00:03:31.620> definitely<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> useful<00:03:32.190> mod<00:03:32.520> the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
so definitely it's a useful mod the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.730 
so definitely it's a useful mod the
pickaxe<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.750> still<00:03:33.960> pretty<00:03:34.140> fast<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.530> mean<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
pickaxe is still pretty fast I mean I

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.960 
pickaxe is still pretty fast I mean I
all<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.220> camera<00:03:35.520> I<00:03:35.550> don't<00:03:35.700> want<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.880> jump

all that camera I don't want to jump
down<00:03:36.090> there<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.450> mine<00:03:36.990> it<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.380> it's

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
down there and mine it but it's it's

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.980 
down there and mine it but it's it's
pretty<00:03:37.770> fast<00:03:38.070> compared<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.550> say<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.000> diamond

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
pretty fast compared to say the diamond

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.080 
pretty fast compared to say the diamond
to<00:03:40.110> never<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.890> compared<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.400> gold<00:03:41.850> but

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
to never it they compared to gold but

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.760 
to never it they compared to gold but
it's<00:03:42.300> not<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.750> super<00:03:43.140> fast<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.650> say

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
it's not as like super fast as say

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.670 
it's not as like super fast as say
diamond<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:44.280> still<00:03:44.490> pretty<00:03:44.670> good<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.120> axe

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
diamond but still pretty good the axe

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.800 
diamond but still pretty good the axe
see<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.830> not<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:48.000> fast<00:03:48.240> but<00:03:48.510> still<00:03:48.660> pretty

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
see it's not so fast but still pretty

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.270 
see it's not so fast but still pretty
good<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.110> mean<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.650> see<00:03:49.770> it's<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.130> get

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
so much lapis so I mean you don't want

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.710 
so much lapis so I mean you don't want
to<00:03:52.170> overdo<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.550> whole<00:03:53.700> mean<00:03:53.970> it's

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
like you know it's just it's it's lapis

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.850 
like you know it's just it's it's lapis
I<00:04:00.810> mean<00:04:00.930> he<00:04:00.990> doesn't<00:04:01.140> say<00:04:01.290> can't<00:04:01.560> really<00:04:01.740> do

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
I mean he doesn't say can't really do

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.949 
I mean he doesn't say can't really do
that<00:04:02.040> much<00:04:02.280> can't<00:04:03.030> be<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.240> good<00:04:03.540> because

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
that much can't be that good because

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.990 
that much can't be that good because
that<00:04:04.230> knows<00:04:04.440> he'll<00:04:04.709> be<00:04:04.860> overpowered<00:04:05.430> now

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
that knows he'll be overpowered now

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.370 
that knows he'll be overpowered now
let's<00:04:06.180> do<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.420> armor<00:04:06.660> protection<00:04:06.990> as<00:04:07.230> you

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
let's do the armor protection as you

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.140 
let's do the armor protection as you
could<00:04:07.530> see<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.100> only<00:04:08.190> does<00:04:08.340> five<00:04:08.580> points<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.030> on

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
could see it only does five points of on

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.610 
could see it only does five points of on
protection<00:04:09.510> compared<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.990> diamond<00:04:10.410> that

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
protection compared to a diamond that

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.100 
protection compared to a diamond that
does<00:04:10.800> 10<00:04:11.010> C<00:04:11.520> in<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.700> armor<00:04:12.360> bar<00:04:12.600> at<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.990> bottom

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
does 10 C in the armor bar at the bottom

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.440 
does 10 C in the armor bar at the bottom
so<00:04:13.350> let's<00:04:13.470> see<00:04:13.560> how<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.800> does<00:04:14.340> towards<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.270> see<00:04:15.330> a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
so let's see how it does towards I see a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.569 
so let's see how it does towards I see a
spider<00:04:15.660> here<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.830> we'll<00:04:17.459> hit<00:04:17.549> them<00:04:18.260> see

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.119 

see<00:04:22.300> not<00:04:22.569> really<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.900> great<00:04:23.139> against<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.710> mean

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:24.129 
see not really that great against I mean

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.809 
see not really that great against I mean
like<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:24.460> get<00:04:25.530> you'll<00:04:26.530> be<00:04:26.650> getting<00:04:26.949> lapses

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
like you get you'll be getting lapses

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.070 
like you get you'll be getting lapses
really<00:04:27.970> really<00:04:28.210> fast<00:04:28.449> so<00:04:28.569> you<00:04:28.720> don't<00:04:28.750> mean<00:04:28.960> you

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
really really fast so you don't mean you

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.540 
really really fast so you don't mean you
don't<00:04:29.139> want<00:04:29.319> to<00:04:29.410> overpowered<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.280> could<00:04:30.430> see

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
don't want to overpowered I could see

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.100 
don't want to overpowered I could see
why<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.729> micro<00:04:31.060> did<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.449> cuz<00:04:31.659> you<00:04:31.840> don't

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
why the micro did that cuz you don't

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.820 
why the micro did that cuz you don't
want<00:04:32.229> super<00:04:32.979> overpowered<00:04:34.020> or<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.379> stuff<00:04:35.590> so

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
want super overpowered or and stuff so

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.200 
want super overpowered or and stuff so
you<00:04:35.919> kind<00:04:36.129> of<00:04:36.159> like<00:04:36.310> over<00:04:36.669> power<00:04:36.879> tools<00:04:37.120> are

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
you kind of like over power tools are

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.219 
you kind of like over power tools are
better<00:04:37.449> than<00:04:37.599> timing<00:04:37.900> because<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> can

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
better than timing because I can

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.350 
better than timing because I can
understand<00:04:38.530> if<00:04:38.620> this<00:04:38.800> if<00:04:39.370> these<00:04:39.580> had<00:04:39.789> more

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
understand if this if these had more

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.480 
understand if this if these had more
durability<00:04:40.750> than<00:04:40.960> say<00:04:41.319> diamond<00:04:41.949> that<00:04:42.370> would

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
durability than say diamond that would

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.159 
durability than say diamond that would
be<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.610> bit<00:04:42.789> much<00:04:43.000> but<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.629> sword<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:43.990> really
