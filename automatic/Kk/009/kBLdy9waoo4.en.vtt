00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 lane search at captain benny height of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.919
 The assembled press explains why 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.950
 not in frankfurt was missing 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 the development of the team 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.610
 Worry wrinkles on the forehead light 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.029
 skepticism in the face of the frustration of frankfurt 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.470
 how is it processed yes it already has 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.930
 take a bit longer I have to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.400
 simply animal disappointed and also 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.840
 angry about the services we have there 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 call because we have of course 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.699
 the chances of a giant gate possibilities 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.630
 you just too easy to 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.309
 we handled it negligently 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.200
 behind closed we have six 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.890
 seven hundred percent 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.210
 had opportunities to score that was not 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.620
 any doorstep that was 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 really one against one situations the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.850
 we just too sleepy myself 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 have handled and then you can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.750
 accordingly not play 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 win if we, of course, honest 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.600
 have to be to ourselves and us 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.559
 have to admit that it with 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 Safety not when the best performance 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.800
 He was also in Frankfurt 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.329
 have delivered then comes one more 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.420
 umpire to the frog there is 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.250
 yes no one is a tor disclaimed and the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 criticism from own manager belongs to the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
 team that is being recorded 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 captain that recorded i believe that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.799
 Of course we also eat ourselves pretty much 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 disappointed with the performance and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.180
 and, of course, even questioned 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.369
 but of course also has one 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 manager the right the team 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.020
 to criticize accordingly if so 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.290
 if we have such an important game then 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.810
 have also ended up spoiling and 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.630
 the team has to accept that and 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.640
 I have to be aware as I said 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.780
 its what manager talked about there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.450
 did and try on the weekend 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.340
 turn as positive as possible 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.740
 if you say something for that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 It took longer to think about it 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.159
 is not the first game where we am 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.759
 say it was so unnecessary to end 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.649
 to lose 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 because not only by the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.460
 There was also a back round in the round 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.829
 already examples for and that is quite true 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 important things riga lett for example 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.590
 or now Nuremberg and Frankfurt as 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.540
 last examples 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 do you have an explanation for it 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.140
 So rather difficult had in frankfurt 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.910
 we certainly have for a long time 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.470
 have a good start again 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.930
 I believe the first 20 minutes absolutely 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.070
 dominated and frankfurt come to the door 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.040
 let come and thus the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.540
 frankfurt has lost eleven 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.040
 a bit of surface water just get 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.450
 probably because the audience 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 naturally motivated accordingly 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.710
 were and also the team forward 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 whipped and it was really 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.170
 too bad we are there a bit 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.610
 mainly, of course, the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.840
 standard situation after all so one 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.580
 have come in distress 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.960
 because we are just stupid foul play then 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.280
 the back have just committed 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.620
 unnecessary were probably just from behind 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.610
 shove or just make stupid fouls 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.430
 and thereby are always standard 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 situations were the last 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.500
 endes were dangerous 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.390
 it is very annoying for us that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.980
 happens again and again but we try 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.000
 Of course, that should be turned off as well 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.410
 The trainer tries the things 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.820
 The manager does of course 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.989
 Again, a clear announcement because I 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.090
 Hope we did that again on the weekend 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.709
 can always implement it 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.120
 It could be the distance 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.590
 that is a developmental step 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.800
 when you play it in many already 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.750
 creates many chances to have one though 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.489
 not always to use and then in 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.410
 the moment is not in a position 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.540
 if you miss several 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.510
 Nevertheless, success has to be said 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.610
 okay we can bump around anyway 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.810
 you put that together so we 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.310
 definitely have one 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.920
 development phase taken last 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.080
 weeks and months the team has 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.959
 worked and it is already 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.040
 Overall, it should be noted that 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.880
 We really have a chance 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.410
 play out 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.190
 also what top-class goals 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.870
 Of course it is very annoying 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.000
 if you are so riesentor possibilities 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.590
 does not use and in reverse make 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.630
 we just still 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.210
 crucial mistakes then last 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.520
 endes too 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.560
 lead against us and that is unnecessary and 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.410
 and the case always monsters with it 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.360
 punish yourself and ins 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.470
 disadvantage 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.480
 First you have to move there 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.830
 running after a residue 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.510
 as against leverkusen where would 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.480
 still a good moral proved 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 have and have turned the game in 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.420
 Unfortunately, frankfurt did not succeed us 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.400
 because then we just get the chance again 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.780
 have used the home 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.019
 Chances Better HSV comes with 1 van der 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.919
 Vaart with so with one 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.060
 certain offensive danger 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.850
 Hamburg has with safety quality 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.290
 front in the top or offensive 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.770
 Mittelfeld but I also believe that 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.270
 hamburg accordingly weaken 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.200
 and we will be with them 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.919
 security even in the week now 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.470
 raussuchen and I hope that 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.540
 the trainer with us the right one 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.460
 key to find the hamburger 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.460
 defend because also to tight games wins
