00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
this you could get the idea I start with

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
this you could get the idea I start with
like<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.150> comma<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:27.380> you<00:00:28.380> come<00:00:28.650> back

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
like a little comma and you come back

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
like a little comma and you come back
and<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> little<00:00:30.000> comma<00:00:30.240> next

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and you do it like a little comma next

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.380 
and you do it like a little comma next
to<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.430> basically<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to that one and basically it's a lot of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
to that one and basically it's a lot of
little<00:00:39.570> commas<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:42.079> put<00:00:43.079> around<00:00:44.090> your

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
little commas just put around your

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.069 
little commas just put around your
initial<00:00:45.570> comma<00:00:50.270> it's<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> illusion

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
initial comma it's just the illusion

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200
