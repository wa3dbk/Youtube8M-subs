00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:26.260 

bah<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.510> do<00:03:17.570> better<00:03:17.750> than<00:03:17.870> event

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.440 

not<00:03:27.020> bad<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.500> for<00:03:27.800> an<00:03:27.890> older<00:03:28.220> hey<00:03:28.490> I<00:03:28.850> don't

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
not bad is it for an older hey I don't

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.330 
not bad is it for an older hey I don't
think<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.660> about<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.900> good<00:03:30.260> power<00:03:30.680> slide<00:03:31.130> is

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
think that about a good power slide is

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.490 
think that about a good power slide is
you<00:03:31.430> need<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.580> get<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.880> big<00:03:32.780> attitude<00:03:33.020> on<00:03:33.410> the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
you need to get it big attitude on the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.310 
you need to get it big attitude on the
way<00:03:33.710> in<00:03:33.980> nice<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.400> sideways<00:03:35.060> nose<00:03:35.450> pointing

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
way in nice and sideways nose pointing

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.550 
way in nice and sideways nose pointing
at<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.040> apex<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.700> corner<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.870> then<00:03:39.260> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
at the apex of the corner and then the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.280 
at the apex of the corner and then the
trick<00:03:39.950> is<00:03:40.760> hanging<00:03:41.300> on<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.750> for<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.110> rest

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
trick is hanging on to it for the rest

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.830 
trick is hanging on to it for the rest
of<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.590> order<00:03:49.030> well<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.270> think<00:03:50.510> we<00:03:50.630> gave<00:03:50.780> it

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
of the order well I do think we gave it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:03.520 
of the order well I do think we gave it
just<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:51.290> little<00:03:51.440> pad<00:03:51.830> too<00:03:52.040> much<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:03.260> was

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
just that little pad too much that was

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.340 
just that little pad too much that was
really<00:04:03.770> good<00:04:04.070> now<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.550> little<00:04:04.850> at<00:04:05.240> its<00:04:06.110> all<00:04:06.320> I

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
really good now a little at its all I

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.040 
really good now a little at its all I
kids<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:07.100> think<00:04:07.460> it's<00:04:07.580> clear<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.850> see<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050
