justice and basically heart of justice
works<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.380> same<00:01:16.409> way<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.159> electivire's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
works the same way that electivire's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.200 
works the same way that electivire's
motor<00:01:18.600> drive<00:01:18.930> works<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.729> hit<00:01:21.060> with

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
motor drive works in that one hit with

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
motor drive works in that one hit with
an<00:01:21.330> electric-type<00:01:21.720> move<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.380> boosts<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
an electric-type move it boosts the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.240 
an electric-type move it boosts the
speed<00:01:23.220> except<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.409> tarik<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> its<00:01:26.040> bit

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
speed except for tarik I on its bit

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
speed except for tarik I on its bit
edited<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.180> different<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.439> when

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
edited in a bit different and it's when

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
edited in a bit different and it's when
he's<00:01:28.890> hit<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> dark-type<00:01:29.520> move<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.540> his

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
he's hit with a dark-type move not his

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.790 
he's hit with a dark-type move not his
speed<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.350> his<00:01:31.470> attack<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:32.040> raise

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
speed but his attack will raise

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.070 
speed but his attack will raise
so<00:01:33.730> you<00:01:33.850> could<00:01:33.940> see<00:01:34.120> this<00:01:34.240> thing<00:01:34.450> being<00:01:34.690> very

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
so you could see this thing being very

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.670 
so you could see this thing being very
attack<00:01:35.830> heavy<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.930> rampaging<00:01:38.650> through

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
attack heavy and just rampaging through

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.310 
attack heavy and just rampaging through
people's<00:01:39.220> teams<00:01:39.580> but<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.750> reason<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:41.140> don't

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
people's teams but the reason I don't

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.480 
people's teams but the reason I don't
think<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.620> is<00:01:41.680> going<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.980> be<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> practical

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
think this is going to be a practical

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.280 
think this is going to be a practical

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
like I said the metagame for the fifth

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.890 
like I said the metagame for the fifth
generation<00:03:21.670> still<00:03:22.120> hasn't<00:03:22.360> really<00:03:22.540> opened<00:03:22.660> up

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
generation still hasn't really opened up

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.449 
generation still hasn't really opened up
yet<00:03:23.080> because<00:03:23.440> obviously<00:03:23.709> it's<00:03:24.160> only<00:03:24.370> in

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
yet because obviously it's only in

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.949 
yet because obviously it's only in
Japanese<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:25.360> don't<00:03:25.510> have<00:03:25.630> all<00:03:25.840> the

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
Japanese so we don't have all the

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.380 
Japanese so we don't have all the
metagame<00:03:26.170> players<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.830> board<00:03:27.100> but<00:03:27.880> when<00:03:28.269> it

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
maybe I'm looking at it in a bit of

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.250 
maybe I'm looking at it in a bit of
a scientific<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.870> mathematical

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260
