I'm<00:01:53.569> all<00:01:53.720> out<00:01:53.959> of<00:01:53.989> framing<00:01:54.530> really<00:01:54.890> can't<00:01:55.130> see

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
I'm all out of framing really can't see

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.089 
I'm all out of framing really can't see
this<00:01:55.849> is<00:01:56.000> like<00:01:56.209> one<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.539> my<00:01:56.630> first<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.259> guess

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
this is like one of my first I guess

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.940 
this is like one of my first I guess
tutorial<00:01:58.819> videos<00:01:59.209> and<00:01:59.630> I'm<00:01:59.840> also<00:02:00.020> using<00:02:00.229> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
tutorial videos and I'm also using a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.010 
tutorial videos and I'm also using a
different<00:02:01.459> own<00:02:02.739> software<00:02:03.739> editing<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.390> this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
different own software editing so this

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.359 
different own software editing so this
might<00:02:06.259> be<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.470> little<00:02:06.799> off<00:02:07.039> but<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:09.709> have<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.250> a

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
might be a little off but I have it in a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.830 
might be a little off but I have it in a
low<00:02:10.489> ponytail<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.209> at<00:02:11.299> this<00:02:11.420> point<00:02:11.630> I'm<00:02:11.810> just

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
low ponytail so at this point I'm just

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.720 
low ponytail so at this point I'm just
showing<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.680> difference<00:02:13.069> between<00:02:13.160> a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
showing you the difference between a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.960 
showing you the difference between a
part<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:14.269> reverted<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.489> little<00:02:16.489> bit<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.879> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
part that's reverted a little bit and a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.210 
part that's reverted a little bit and a
part<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.480> hasn't<00:02:17.780> been<00:02:18.110> reverted<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.099> you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
part that hasn't been reverted and you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.759 
part that hasn't been reverted and you
can<00:02:19.430> see<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.819> difference<00:02:20.269> my<00:02:20.569> name<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.110> sweat<00:02:21.590> a

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
can see the difference my name I sweat a

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.199 
can see the difference my name I sweat a
lot<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.489> area

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
lot in that area

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.809 
lot in that area
so<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.200> tend<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.799> get<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.130> lot<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.489> reversion

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
so I tend to get a lot of reversion

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.620 
so I tend to get a lot of reversion
there<00:02:26.239> but<00:02:27.230> back<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.769> tutorial<00:02:28.519> now<00:02:28.760> so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
there but back to the tutorial now so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.870 
there but back to the tutorial now so
I'm<00:02:29.810> putting<00:02:30.109> this<00:02:30.260> top<00:02:30.590> part<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.220> all<00:02:31.459> a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
I'm putting this top part and all a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.020 
I'm putting this top part and all a
looser<00:02:32.600> ponytail<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:34.340> figured<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.790> needed

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
looser ponytail and I figured I needed

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.210 
looser ponytail and I figured I needed
something<00:02:35.359> to<00:02:35.540> control<00:02:36.109> my<00:02:36.350> edges<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.040> use

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
something to control my edges so I use

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.629 
something to control my edges so I use
the<00:02:37.400> curls<00:02:37.730> controlled<00:02:38.680> paint<00:02:39.680> which<00:02:40.519> I

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
the curls controlled paint which I

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.129 
the curls controlled paint which I
probably<00:02:40.850> shouldn't<00:02:41.299> have<00:02:41.359> because<00:02:41.810> it's

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
probably shouldn't have because it's

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.559 
probably shouldn't have because it's
water-based<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.850> either

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
water-based and it either

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.160 
water-based and it either
made<00:02:45.019> my<00:02:45.410> reversion<00:02:46.040> more<00:02:46.280> apparent<00:02:46.880> or<00:02:47.599> it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
made my reversion more apparent or it

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.729 
made my reversion more apparent or it
created<00:02:49.010> more<00:02:49.220> reversion<00:02:49.910> on<00:02:50.150> my<00:02:50.329> edges<00:02:50.840> but

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
created more reversion on my edges but

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:28.690 
created more reversion on my edges but
I'll<00:02:52.069> let<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.400> see<00:02:52.579> that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:47.589 

Oh

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.050 

what<00:03:48.599> you're<00:03:48.900> taking<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:50.099> now<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.400> my<00:03:50.760> hair

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
what you're taking so now that my hair

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.350 
what you're taking so now that my hair
is<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.750> ultra<00:03:52.200> ponytail<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.190> am<00:03:53.790> going<00:03:54.120> to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
is in that ultra ponytail I am going to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.289 
is in that ultra ponytail I am going to
find<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.349> middle<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:56.040> their<00:03:56.340> ponytail<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
find the middle of their ponytail and

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.860 
find the middle of their ponytail and
take<00:03:57.629> that<00:03:57.900> ponytail<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.040> grab<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.879> on<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
take that ponytail and grab it on the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.869 
take that ponytail and grab it on the
back<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.470> front<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.010> pull<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> on<00:04:02.670> through

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
back to the front and pull it on through

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.119 
back to the front and pull it on through
and<00:04:03.599> that's<00:04:04.080> going<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.379> create<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.950> this

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
and that's going to create like this

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.880 
and that's going to create like this
kind<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.640> twisting<00:04:06.390> look<00:04:06.720> effect<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.709> and

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
kind of twisting look effect to it and

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.770 
kind of twisting look effect to it and
then<00:04:08.340> I'll<00:04:08.489> pull<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.879> corner<00:04:09.209> here<00:04:09.390> just<00:04:09.659> to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
