I<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.260> instead<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
probably could do this instead and not

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.560 
probably could do this instead and not
have<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> worry<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.770> anything<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
have to worry about anything is just a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.959 
have to worry about anything is just a
slice<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> into<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.920> big<00:01:02.219> piece<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.850> then

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
slice it into one big piece and then

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
slice it into one big piece and then
just<00:01:03.180> cut<00:01:03.359> them<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.510> into<00:01:03.899> pieces<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> do

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
just cut them down into pieces what I do

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
just cut them down into pieces what I do
is<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.519> usually<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.540> six<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> eight

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
is I usually go in from six to eight

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
is I usually go in from six to eight
minute<00:01:07.350> pieces<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.130> don't<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
minute pieces and I don't like to do it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
minute pieces and I don't like to do it
longer<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> file<00:01:09.960> sizes<00:01:10.260> get

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
longer just because the file sizes get

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620 
longer just because the file sizes get
kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> big<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.060> other<00:01:12.330> people
