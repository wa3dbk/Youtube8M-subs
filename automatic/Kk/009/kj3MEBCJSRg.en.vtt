00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hi, this is rock and in this fast video. 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.830
 I want to talk to you about a 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.730
 very common doubt is for you that it is 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 diabetic and do not know what a coffee is 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 the healthiest morning for diabetes is 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 for those who have diabetes are type 11 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.230
 your body does not manufacture insulin and you 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.180
 have to take high doses of insulin and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 many times most diabetics have 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 to take insulin 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.119
 who is the type or who is type 2 who 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.579
 the great majority are generally 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.550
 associated with obesity and has a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.770
 other problems you end up receiving 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 wrong information there for many times 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.190
 who should be aligned with the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.969
 awareness that you are a professional 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 Cheers 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.460
 he does not know he's not by 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.039
 within which science shows the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.270
 importance of good nutrition in the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.500
 case here for breakfast I want 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.719
 leave a tip for a breakfast 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.050
 healthy for you who are diabetic are 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.289
 type 2 and I want to show you first 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.180
 Why is important a breakfast? 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.159
 healthy breakfast would be 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.549
 healthy first place I want to show you 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.000
 the following you are diabetic the presence 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:20.189
 than high levels deny that diabetes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.720
 type 2 most common 70 high levels of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.460
 sugar glucose in your blood 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.340
 this generates a series of problems is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.979
 inflations a number of forces you to take 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.009
 high doses of medication lots of medication 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.640
 what I call the diabetes medicated but 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.619
 we need today to make our 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.899
 Our best remedy is to make the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.610
 feeding our main medication 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.340
 the prominent place are in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.810
 power feed that smart 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.210
 intelligent for diabetes control 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.610
 because it is the syndicate if they make you 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.680
 needs high levels of 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 insulin type 2 diabetes is manufactured 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.149
 here in the pancreas which is an organ that is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.220
 here and the more you use more insulin 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.840
 only the relief there came his time 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.730
 cells 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.940
 cansassem so much of glucose in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.360
 sue the cell, it closes the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.760
 doors only I do not want anymore and cosmos I want 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.040
 the thinner it stays tough on the floor 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.959
 He said insulin resistance is over 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.530
 getting fat is developing the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.760
 problems such as high blood pressure 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.860
 high triglycerides is that they are fats 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.470
 inflammation produced in your child 's 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.540
 so it raises a lot of problems 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.879
 a series of complications in the series of 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.860
 suffering for diabetics is not 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.140
 type 1 is type 2 in this case that the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.690
 type 2 have to take insulin because 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.530
 not manufacture insulin and now we can 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.579
 talk which would be a breakfast is that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.410
 would be healthy for diabetics 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.730
 unfortunately it was nutritionists and 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.870
 doctors have passed that bread with coffee 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.670
 in the morning 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.769
 biscuits or whether it be whole wheat bread or 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.060
 abnormal be biscuits is worse than 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.250
 blood sugar 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.040
 so you can ask without using it 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.420
 that I can use my breakfast for 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 maintain the glucose levels which I 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.889
 I need someday I lower that download 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.019
 the glucose levels in your blood to 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.720
 you lower the amount of insulin 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.959
 this one is toxic excess glucose 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.730
 who has diabetes is toxic chicken body 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.670
 maltreats the body generates a lot of disease 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.170
 blindness and certain amputation of the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.019
 Insulin is also a series of problems 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.859
 including tumors cysts the excess of 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.900
 insulin 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.049
 excess insulin and excess insulin 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.400
 glucose does very bad for your health 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.290
 for you that diabetes then you 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.090
 need food with which the low 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.430
 amount of glucose 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.620
 It is an example that breakfast 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:08.430
 healthy for those who are diabetic the omelette 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:10.500
 with 29 - 33 beat they saute in the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.370
 do not use soybean oil in accordance with 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.169
 butter 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.570
 ok it was a tile is you can use up the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.329
 coconut oil that are healthy fats 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.430
 and that will be what will give you low 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.950
 Glucose levels help in speaking your 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.320
 blood and will fall 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.180
 your citizenship is what you need 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.270
 decreasing these medications in which you 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.330
 you can not even do your andretti with 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.890
 Broccoli is I talk a lot this subject 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.680
 feeding that involves several aspects 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:47.930
 here is just a quick tip right 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:49.670
 in my course controlled diabetes that 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.940
 controlled diabetes is a training that 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.260
 I created based on the latest 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.120
 discoveries in good science that are 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.580
 studies of high level of evidence 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.090
 the largest universities in the world. 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.570
 world as well as jorge in sun hardwares 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.300
 rock at universities in high 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.710
 prestige studies show the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.080
 that you should do what you should 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.810
 what supplements are for those who are 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.090
 diabetic so that you can learn to 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.130
 take care of your diabetes is to take care of your 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.380
 health and reduce this amount of 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.810
 positron medication by placing 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.840
 smart food instead of going out 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.780
 if you are interested in transforming 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.080
 your life leading your ordinary life is one 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.360
 health you've never had to rescue your 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.490
 health that lost this terrible disease 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.140
 click somewhere in that video that I 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.630
 I have a special presentation for 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.700
 you I will stop here 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.700
 a big hug and until the next video
