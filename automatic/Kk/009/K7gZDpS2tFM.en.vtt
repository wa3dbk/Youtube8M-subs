00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Welcome back to a new episode 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.710
 forming I want games namely the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.719
 scorpion and have it with the fire 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.730
 I wanted you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.870
 actually show the kangaroo pack today 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.449
 because I put it down in the comments 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 However, I have noticed 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.260
 that they pack the kangaroo a bit 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.460
 have changed that means I have 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 yesterday that no euro pack ever 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.029
 Tried it was great I have to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 I honestly admired it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.050
 but when I tried again today 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 I've been weakening since 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.469
 noticed that changed a bit 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 then you lose life when you live 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.579
 double jumps because you are too far 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 touched up in the ground that is for 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.360
 example has been done badly and man 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 can not double even in the water 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.629
 which is really jumping for me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 was very cool what the kangaroo was concerned 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.539
 that is why I am now even the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.829
 scorpion because of himself very well 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 should be or 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.829
 I have also looked at him before 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750
 but not yet but somehow 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 has been changed 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 we'll just try it out in the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.659
 Normally it is like that when I am here with 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 matter that he is also a year poison 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.810
 Damage to it will get you 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.390
 In turn, he should actually be lighter 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 to be defeated but only if I 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.670
 a sword that was pretty good 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.939
 I would say that down here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.150
 then run and I really hope that 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.170
 I also think it's a box 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.840
 so that we will immediately follow it 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 have another recording, so to speak 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.610
 that is, I must also here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.680
 hurry for this round 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.689
 And this role also has to be online 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.549
 come and do that before we get the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.549
 record next round or the next 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 Let's go if you say that 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.430
 we have only 17 am and at 19:00 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.899
 the recording that means I have to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 within the two hours of rendering 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.890
 and then also upload and so 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.939
 cultivation and so on and that could 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.820
 a little bit short will be the same 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.030
 building houses we have exactly enough for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.009
 Of course, a single sword is not 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.570
 people then feel that good then me 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.950
 complete with that because we can 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.560
 then hatcher forgave because I have nothing 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.390
 another had a sword as that is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 I would actually need it too 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.210
 one more 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.780
 helmet so in 2001 compared degrade stock 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.640
 Here again that went pretty fast 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.530
 most of the time I am exactly finished when the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.960
 time is over and now I even have 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.750
 15 seconds before me so I'm running 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.390

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:42.110
 I can walk yes I am Jesus old me 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.980
 can run over the water protection time 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.780
 to end it 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.790

 right after the plate that goes out 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.970
 I have five gold that means that is 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.970
 just good for me 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.540

 Exactly and now I'm running in exactly 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:53.070
 I actually wanted the counter-direction 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.410
 say but then let us be with that 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.890

 the joy is okay is alright yes 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.790
 clear 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.790
 yes, yes 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:22.230

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:24.600
 round the ok should be so there in front 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.570
 one of them makes me a bit 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.500
 God does not just scare me 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:34.790
 know slowly makes me 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:37.020
 the tanks are equipped as visa yes yes yes 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.880
 What a pity 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.560
 but somehow I do not know 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.730
 you also saw it in the 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.510
 video somehow got on with the mouse 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.100
 down or 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.820
 after unmoved, I do not mean my mouse 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.800
 that was really moving 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.180
 Actually, that's what I've had since then 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.360
 Therefore, a new mouse has been scarce 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.030
 one and a half months seven more often times 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.190
 in the videos we have to slowly one 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.590
 buy new mouse 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.780
 the comments from gaming mouse 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.830
 you think are good then I me times 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.590
 and then I can sometimes 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.000
 maybe buy one of them and then 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.560
 Of course we'll let you know which one 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.840
 I bought everything then clear 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.950
 ok then i would say if this 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.500
 has also gone round when I ride this time 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.210
 did not win but then let 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.590
 just thumb up there and write 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.840
 send me the comments and if i have the 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.130
 did not like round write yours 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.080
 comments why they did not like it 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.190
 so that I can improve even if 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.350
 Otherwise I can stay that way 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.210
 as I am and like some people 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.140
 most likely not when they say 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.250
 until next time 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.250
 and bye
