00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
range of skills that I'm that I utilized

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.850 
range of skills that I'm that I utilized
throughout<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.720> filming<00:02:07.020> process<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.740> do

throughout the filming process but do

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.680 
throughout the filming process but do
and<00:02:08.100> there's<00:02:08.250> also<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.640> kind<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and there's also the kind of you know to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.999 
and there's also the kind of you know to
have<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> try<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.259> bear<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.560> mind<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.890> well

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
have to try and bear in mind as well

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.500 
have to try and bear in mind as well
that<00:02:11.039> math<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.819> blind<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that math is not blind in the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.150 
that math is not blind in the
conventional<00:02:12.959> sense<00:02:13.140> because<00:02:13.560> he<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.040> know

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
conventional sense because he you know

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.040 
conventional sense because he you know
obviously<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.730> these<00:02:14.910> heightened<00:02:15.660> senses

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
obviously has these heightened senses

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
obviously has these heightened senses
which<00:02:16.260> allow<00:02:16.500> him<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.860> function<00:02:17.610> differently

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
which allow him to function differently

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.300 
which allow him to function differently
and<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.959> was<00:02:19.080> making<00:02:19.290> sure<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.190> know

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and so it was making sure that you know

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.860 
and so it was making sure that you know
making<00:02:20.550> sure<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> consistency

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
making sure that there was a consistency

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.630 
making sure that there was a consistency
to<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.410> what<00:02:22.560> were<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> boundaries

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
to that and what were the boundaries

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.809 
to that and what were the boundaries
there<00:02:23.880> could<00:02:24.239> be<00:02:24.390> tweaked<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.290> changed<00:02:25.819> will

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
there could be tweaked and changed will

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.100 
there could be tweaked and changed will
you<00:02:27.000> guys<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.959> next<00:02:28.670> Netflix<00:02:29.670> series
