00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
in this area and I think this is all the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.940 
in this area and I think this is all the
dirt<00:01:04.250> from<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.140> will<00:01:06.140> probably<00:01:06.350> crawl

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
dirt from that will probably crawl

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.740 
dirt from that will probably crawl
around<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.520> metal<00:01:08.150> detected<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.570> little

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
around it and metal detected a little

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.720 
around it and metal detected a little
bit<00:01:10.720> newer<00:01:11.720> bottle<00:01:14.080> preschool<00:01:15.160> all<00:01:16.160> right<00:01:16.370> we

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.649 
bit newer bottle preschool all right we
made<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.910> up<00:01:17.120> here<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.600> little

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
made it up here to this little

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.149

so<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.440> good<00:02:32.620> example<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.790> types

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
so this is a good example of the types

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.670 
so this is a good example of the types
of<00:02:34.090> places<00:02:34.299> that<00:02:34.599> you<00:02:34.660> might<00:02:34.840> want<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.170> think

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
of places that you might want to think

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.339 
of places that you might want to think
about<00:02:35.830> metal<00:02:36.640> detecting<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:37.900> we've<00:02:38.319> had

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
about metal detecting you know we've had

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.660 
about metal detecting you know we've had
our<00:02:38.500> eye<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.739> this<00:02:38.980> place<00:02:39.069> we've<00:02:39.459> kind<00:02:39.640> of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
our eye on this place we've kind of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.280 
our eye on this place we've kind of
poked<00:02:39.849> around<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.209> little<00:02:40.390> bit<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.780> they

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
poked around a little bit and they

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.559 
poked around a little bit and they
finally<00:02:41.530> came<00:02:41.829> in<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.310> cleared<00:02:43.150> out<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.329> bunch

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
finally came in and cleared out a bunch

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.380 
finally came in and cleared out a bunch
of<00:02:43.720> brush<00:02:44.340> made<00:02:45.340> way<00:02:45.549> for<00:02:45.579> us<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.239> come

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
of brush made way for us so we can come

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.880 
of brush made way for us so we can come
in<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.840> hispasat<00:02:47.290> we've<00:02:47.560> never<00:02:47.709> been

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
in here and hispasat we've never been

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.390 
in here and hispasat we've never been
able<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.099> hit<00:02:48.220> before<00:02:49.620> yeah<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.829> sometimes<00:02:51.220> if

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
able to hit before yeah so sometimes if

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.890 
able to hit before yeah so sometimes if
you<00:02:51.519> wonder<00:02:51.790> around<00:02:51.970> these<00:02:52.209> parks<00:02:52.599> enough

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
you wonder around these parks enough

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.619 
you wonder around these parks enough
you'll<00:02:53.109> stumble<00:02:53.379> across<00:02:54.480> some<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.540> these

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
you'll stumble across some of these

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.599 
you'll stumble across some of these
older<00:02:56.470> structures<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.190> believe<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:57.459> a

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
older structures and I believe that's a

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.750 
older structures and I believe that's a
well<00:02:57.819> that's<00:02:58.150> been<00:02:58.299> covered<00:02:58.540> up<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.400> I<00:03:00.400> think

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
well that's been covered up and I think

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.830 
well that's been covered up and I think
there<00:03:00.879> was<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.170> homestead<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.470> property

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
there was a homestead on this property

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.180 
there was a homestead on this property
way<00:03:04.840> back<00:03:05.079> when<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:08.470> right<00:03:08.739> even<00:03:08.920> though<00:03:09.069> we

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
way back when all right even though we

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.520 
way back when all right even though we
had<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> crappy<00:03:09.970> day<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:10.780> said<00:03:11.260> we<00:03:11.349> were<00:03:11.440> going

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
had a crappy day we said we were going

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.339 
had a crappy day we said we were going
to<00:03:11.620> start<00:03:11.799> doing<00:03:12.040> more<00:03:12.190> wrap-ups<00:03:13.140> videos<00:03:14.140> no

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
to start doing more wrap-ups videos no

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.050 
to start doing more wrap-ups videos no
good<00:03:14.530> without<00:03:14.620> wrap-ups<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.579> only<00:03:15.760> thing<00:03:15.940> we

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
good without wrap-ups the only thing we

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.589 
good without wrap-ups the only thing we
found<00:03:16.090> today<00:03:16.720> worth<00:03:17.500> noting<00:03:18.069> I<00:03:18.359> think<00:03:19.359> or<00:03:19.569> a

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
found today worth noting I think or a

found today worth noting I think or a
couple<00:03:19.870> wheat<00:03:20.019> pennies<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.940> couple<00:03:21.940> bullets

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
couple wheat pennies a couple bullets

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.020 
couple wheat pennies a couple bullets
not<00:03:22.480> too<00:03:22.660> old<00:03:22.840> though<00:03:23.760> there's<00:03:24.760> some<00:03:24.880> loose

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
not too old though there's some loose

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.520 
not too old though there's some loose
change<00:03:26.099> crap<00:03:27.540> yeah<00:03:28.540> some<00:03:28.930> pieces<00:03:29.109> of<00:03:29.349> brass

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
change crap yeah some pieces of brass

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.479 
change crap yeah some pieces of brass
which<00:03:30.310> those<00:03:30.519> add<00:03:30.730> up<00:03:30.760> after<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.299> while<00:03:32.489> but

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
which those add up after a while but

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.449 
which those add up after a while but
yeah<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.319> guess<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:35.859> point<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.310> make<00:03:36.400> here

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
yeah the I guess the point to make here

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.550 
yeah the I guess the point to make here
is<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.849> clean<00:03:37.060> up<00:03:37.090> all<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.780> garbage<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.319> find

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
is you clean up all the garbage you find

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.960 
is you clean up all the garbage you find
out<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.829> field<00:03:39.099> because<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:39.579> intend<00:03:39.849> on

out in the field because we intend on

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.610 
out in the field because we intend on
going<00:03:40.120> back<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.510> place<00:03:40.840> later<00:03:41.109> we<00:03:41.500> will

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
going back to that place later we will

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.180 
going back to that place later we will
have<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.889> contend<00:03:42.190> with<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.519> then<00:03:44.190> don't
