00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
amazing I got to show you some of it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.910 
amazing I got to show you some of it
okay<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.880> totally<00:01:57.390> redid<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.469> far<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.770> well<00:01:58.890> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
okay they totally redid as far as well I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.109 
okay they totally redid as far as well I
mean<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.310> didn't<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> marine<00:01:59.850> figure

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
mean they didn't have a marine figure

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
mean they didn't have a marine figure
before<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.540> everything<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.469> read<00:02:02.040> on

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
before so everything they do is read on

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.109 
before so everything they do is read on
but<00:02:03.140> he<00:02:04.140> has<00:02:04.700> articulation<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.850> over<00:02:06.030> the

place<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.360> has<00:02:06.450> 26<00:02:07.049> points<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.439> articulation

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
place he has 26 points of articulation

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.279 
place he has 26 points of articulation
which<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> outstanding<00:02:09.209> he<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> ballpoint

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
which is outstanding he has a ballpoint

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.809 
which is outstanding he has a ballpoint
head<00:02:10.679> which<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.370> nothing<00:02:11.790> new

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
head which you know that's nothing new

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.070 
head which you know that's nothing new
they've<00:02:12.120> already<00:02:12.239> had<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
they've already had that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380 
they've already had that
and<00:02:13.800> he<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.130> look<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> down<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.210> can't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and he can look up and down he can't

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.270 
and he can look up and down he can't
look<00:02:15.570> very<00:02:15.780> far<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> either<00:02:16.440> side<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:17.130> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
look very far to either side because of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.340 
look very far to either side because of
his<00:02:17.400> armor<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.940> here<00:02:18.210> protecting<00:02:18.990> his<00:02:19.110> neck

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
his armor right here protecting his neck

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.860 
his armor right here protecting his neck
but<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.810> bad<00:02:23.120> he<00:02:24.120> also<00:02:24.300> has

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
but you know it's not so bad he also has

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.400 
but you know it's not so bad he also has
ball<00:02:25.620> joints<00:02:26.160> right<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.480> his<00:02:27.600> arm<00:02:27.900> right

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
ball joints right here in his arm right

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.200 
ball joints right here in his arm right
here<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.770> shoulder<00:02:29.070> connects<00:02:29.400> however

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
here with the shoulder connects however

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.960 
here with the shoulder connects however
the<00:02:30.930> shoulder<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.950> rotates<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.760> have

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the shoulder also rotates so you have

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.670 
the shoulder also rotates so you have
the<00:02:33.060> ball<00:02:33.270> joint<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.960> arm<00:02:34.140> rotates

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the ball joint and then the arm rotates

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.880 
the ball joint and then the arm rotates
so<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> even<00:02:35.100> get<00:02:35.370> further<00:02:35.850> articulation<00:02:36.890> he

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so you even get further articulation he

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.610 
so you even get further articulation he
has<00:02:38.130> her<00:02:38.280> too<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.760> elbow<00:02:39.180> right<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.440> at

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
has her too in the elbow right here at

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.980 
has her too in the elbow right here at
his<00:02:40.710> forearm<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.520> twists<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.360> didn't<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:42.810> his

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
his forearm it twists I didn't think his

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.570 
his forearm it twists I didn't think his
hands<00:02:43.290> would<00:02:43.530> rotate<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.980> thought<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.340> because

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
hands would rotate a thought is because

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.980 
hands would rotate a thought is because
his<00:02:44.700> wrists<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.300> anything<00:02:45.540> except

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
his wrists don't have anything except

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.410 
his wrists don't have anything except
going<00:02:46.170> back<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.040> forth<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.210> actually

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
going back and forth but it actually

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.060 
going back and forth but it actually
rotates<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.470> way<00:02:49.560> around<00:02:49.680> right<00:02:50.040> here

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
rotates all the way around right here

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.290 
rotates all the way around right here
which<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:51.360> awesome<00:02:51.650> because<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.270> it

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
which is awesome because I just like it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.210 
which is awesome because I just like it
when<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> figure<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.080> do<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> whole<00:02:55.470> lot<00:02:55.500> his

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
when a figure can do a whole lot his

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.830 
when a figure can do a whole lot his
legs<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.670> articulation<00:02:57.270> all<00:02:57.360> over<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.630> place

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
legs of articulation all over the place

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.820 
legs of articulation all over the place
but<00:02:58.590> unlike<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.280> ODST<00:03:00.090> his<00:03:00.840> feet<00:03:01.230> are<00:03:01.410> also<00:03:01.560> on

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
but unlike the ODST his feet are also on

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.980 
but unlike the ODST his feet are also on
a<00:03:01.860> ball<00:03:02.100> joint<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.910> angle<00:03:03.120> them<00:03:03.780> so

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
a ball joint so you can angle them so

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.590 
a ball joint so you can angle them so
they<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.110> actually<00:03:04.380> stand<00:03:05.220> no<00:03:06.209> more<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
they can actually stand no more of that

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.510 
they can actually stand no more of that
bull<00:03:07.170> crap<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.770> go<00:03:07.920> up<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.280> down

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
bull crap but they just go up and down

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.150 
bull crap but they just go up and down
so<00:03:09.450> he<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.930> do<00:03:10.050> all<00:03:10.260> kinds<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.680> stuff<00:03:10.740> pose

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
so he can do all kinds of stuff pose

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.300 
so he can do all kinds of stuff pose
why's<00:03:11.430> he<00:03:12.300> does<00:03:12.540> not<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.290> peg<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.890> his<00:03:14.070> back

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
why's he does not have a peg on his back

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.280 
why's he does not have a peg on his back

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
other weapon so that is a downer but i

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.690 
other weapon so that is a downer but i
mean<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.500> not<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.070> big<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.519> deal

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
he does have one on his legs so you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.380 
he does have one on his legs so you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.969 
helmets so they did a really good job
with<00:04:58.669> him<00:04:59.590> now<00:05:00.590> in<00:05:01.509> comparison<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:02.810> scale<00:05:03.169> he

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
with him now in comparison to scale he

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.300 
with him now in comparison to scale he
is<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.930> exact<00:05:06.199> same<00:05:06.440> height<00:05:06.680> as<00:05:06.889> an<00:05:07.009> ODST

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
is like the exact same height as an ODST

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.100 
is like the exact same height as an ODST
which<00:05:07.789> fits<00:05:08.150> he<00:05:08.449> should<00:05:08.659> be<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.930> same

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.399 
which fits he should be in the same
scale<00:05:09.409> as<00:05:09.440> them<00:05:09.759> in<00:05:10.759> comparison<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.840> Spartan
