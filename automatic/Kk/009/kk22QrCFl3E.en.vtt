00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
this quest as well but I recommend using

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.750 
this quest as well but I recommend using
the<00:00:19.289> second<00:00:19.650> portion<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> just

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the second portion if you have it just

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.890 
the second portion if you have it just
because<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> make<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.689> go<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
because it's going to make it go a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.230 
because it's going to make it go a
little<00:00:22.199> bit<00:00:22.380> faster<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.100> will<00:00:23.970> allow<00:00:24.180> you

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
little bit faster as it will allow you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720 
little bit faster as it will allow you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
to access the dog or Oasis Waypoint if

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
to access the dog or Oasis Waypoint if
you<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.539> using<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.990> begin<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.439> shin<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
you are using the begin for shin this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.470
