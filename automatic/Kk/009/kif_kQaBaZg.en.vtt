00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
a little complicated and if you know

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.500 
a little complicated and if you know
your<00:05:32.530> episode<00:05:33.220> to<00:05:33.460> know<00:05:33.640> your<00:05:33.850> trivia<00:05:34.270> and

stuff you're going to get more out of it

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.540 
stuff you're going to get more out of it
so<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.550> was<00:05:36.700> really<00:05:36.970> made<00:05:38.250> for<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.340> die-hard

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
so this was really made for the die-hard

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.010 
so this was really made for the die-hard
horde<00:05:40.330> fans<00:05:40.840> for<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.350> hardcore<00:05:41.680> fans<00:05:42.220> and<00:05:43.020> but

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
horde fans for the hardcore fans and but

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.900 
horde fans for the hardcore fans and but
still<00:05:44.290> I<00:05:44.320> think<00:05:44.470> accessible<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.430> non-fans

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
still I think accessible to non-fans

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.150 
still I think accessible to non-fans

and explosion there's enough action the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.260 
and explosion there's enough action the
key<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.500> person<00:05:50.980> who<00:05:51.070> doesn't<00:05:51.280> know<00:05:51.520> like<00:05:52.060> the
