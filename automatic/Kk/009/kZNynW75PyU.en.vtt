 the greatest of 3ds to pass by 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.630
 Printed prosthesis is an argument 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.489
 so both could do a bit more 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.049
 talk shop and exchange 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.930

 cool guys the fans in humanity 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.540
 to react again and again 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.269
 example of the doner kebab owner hysteria 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.950
 news hoof house nr grs the fact is 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.959

 needy people come to him and 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.930
 it simply can not afford 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.910
 get food and a drink with him 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.410
 in vain the idea came to him a friend 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.420
 he told me, among other things 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.739
 one-euro jobbering will work together 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.180
 that there are people who are working because they are 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.430
 to somehow make themselves useful 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.959
 but still can not afford it 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.459
 I can not only do that personally 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.200
 Hospitality that he does not tackle 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.459
 in the right place big heart on 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.980
 right spot and for all who are 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.440
 think anonymous donate 50 or 100 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.510
 euro to africa wrong every time one 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130
 the right place tackles first 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.630
 help in front of your own door 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.430
 maybe not the whole world 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.260
 But he gets his grip on his 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.310
 big hearts shows that it does 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.860
 it works differently 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.090
 now come to a nice topic 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.489
 the video game still one 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.440
 Controversial cultural assets are like smava 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.000
 minecraft the turkish 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.890
 The Ministry of Family Affairs sticks to it 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.650
 minecraft is supposed to be in the whole turkey 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.790
 Violence shooter will be completely banned 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.170
 maybe not necessarily now 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.510
 the problem but not this 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.069
 Of course, the turkish looks devilish stuff 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.110
 Family Ministry that you in this 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.180
 play among other things houses can build na 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.340
 clear but to protect these worlds the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.860
 you have to create hostile ones 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.840
 But creatures are killed is the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.090
 primary goal is to build me up but 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.890
 defend and kill and with that 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.230
 the game happens completely on violence 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.540
 and also calls for it sounds weird 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.760
 But at least if it is after the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.799
 Family Ministry is okay, however 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.760
 finds this action absolutely ridiculous 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.350
 I would love to have one 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.030
 look other side of this medal 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.280
 Let's take a look at the work of 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.989
 michael langlois is family and 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.419
 psychotherapist and he sees minecraft 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.979
 can minecraft a completely different light 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.000
 very young adolescents 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.560
 difficult difficult 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.510
 family relationships or homes 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.310
 for example, help incredible 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.990
 Trust in your own can 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.360
 minecraft can develop loudly according to his 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.470
 often study these very much 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.240
 retired lonely people in 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.280
 Show special that they the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.080
 can change the world if it suits them 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.520
 do not like to complain 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.830
 These are the things that are in fashion 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.570
 cooperation with a therapy into the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.370
 real life can be transferred to the 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.080
 world does not have to be like me 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.460
 and she does not have to 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.590
 stay like they do not like me 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.930
 great approach and even in the game 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.820
 is almost in group therapies over the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.800
 Learn how to interact with others 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.050
 dealing with conflicts as you groups 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.150
 Dynamics even solve violent problems 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.860
 to deal with the property of others 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.900
 has such playful approaches for 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.760
 I find therapy with children 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.320
 absolutely terrific and while doing so 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.820
 insane success is achieved 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.590
 discussed elsewhere that one 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.539
 because of that would have to forbid violence during 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.889
 again, somewhere else in 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.479
 be the war sent to on 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.760
 adults shoot this polemik 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.289
 Fits here only to 20 percent pure but 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.820
 I like to take them away before I leave 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.220
 you again 100 times in the comments 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.870
 read and much before the and cardwell 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.870
 asked again my shoulder 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.270
 in spite of the ladies virgin sapling band 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.460
 openly admits a halfway relaxed 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.090
 monday the best army you know 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.710
 decision 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.850
 the rest of the week does not make it good 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.140
 makes it better community health 25 32 11 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.140
 now here with taste
