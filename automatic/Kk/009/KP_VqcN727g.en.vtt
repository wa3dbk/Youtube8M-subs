00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.250
 our country produces over 80 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.010
 million tons of oil 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.890
 if structurally take our own 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 oil is production oil let's say 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.429
 Kazmunaygaz communal you know it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.700
 sufficient volume but in the country in which 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.550
 there is a shortage 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.180
 gas and fuel lubricants any other 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.790
 products and tanos here in my opinion 1 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.120
 if we are generally together with foreign 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.420
 companies produce 90 million 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.760
 now I guess somewhere 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.149
 the need of our country is only 10 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.870
 million considering planting and harvesting 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.420
 Wednesdays and plus here remember all of us 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 gasoline canister diesel for heating 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.490
 cities including the capital on diesel 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.020
 which is so necessary for this once 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.090
 fundamentally resolve the issue internal 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.369
 the need of the state side of the people 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.680
 this is a national interest and questions 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.979
 national security sit down millions 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.110
 or 8 million or 15 need to set it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.930
 isolate and close forever is a question 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.880
 all basic find 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.100
 on the contrary, they are all exported but inside 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 we have nothing and now we depend on 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 gasoline and diesel Russian now 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 Azerbaijani asks for someone else there 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.060
 but this is absurd this is insanity 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.040
 the experience of other countries we don't 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.170
 distributed did not tell us unprofitable 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.950
 other countries experience says if you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 oil country in your oil country 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.259
 gasoline should be cheaper here liter 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.689
 gasoline is cheaper than a liter of mineral water 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.600
 Well, about here is my 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.520
 approach if these questions and problems and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.500
 instructed me I would solve it like this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.869
 but not only played you suffer i 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.929
 I suffer why the price rises to you no one 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.580
 don't explain on gas and why everything 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.590
 officials depend on whom 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 oil policy is in place 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.450
 gasoline only gets more expensive 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.470
 but his main thing is that he disappears and this topic 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.849
 which affects national interest 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.680
 national economy national 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.220
 national economic security 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.160
 security country without energy 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.620
 you know many there it lives in which 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.280
 there in what pit and debt and so on 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 with stagnation there and recessions in the economy 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.510
 process 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.680
 and we have a country thank God is full 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.170
 energy and is full of different 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.269
 sources of motivation to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.329
 on the contrary, we have a standard of living not 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.440
 rose decreased the opposite 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.160
 according to the level of profitability 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 which is in the hands of the population 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.599
 if we are not in the cinema and the side is then generally 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.269
 we should be we have neighbors 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.700
 countries and here we laughed at 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.609
 seriously not perceived and there the light 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.060
 free gasoline is less cost there 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.609
 loaves of bread there and so on so on 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.799
 that is, it is clear to us now that whom 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.290
 we ignored those neighboring countries inflicting 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.250
 to orient in many respects must especially 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.250
 in energy policy
