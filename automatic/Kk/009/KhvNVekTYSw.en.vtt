the air for the Wharton and wrong target

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.589 
the air for the Wharton and wrong target
more<00:02:16.860> than<00:02:16.980> 10<00:02:17.370> at<00:02:17.730> once<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.840> su-35<00:02:19.680> appeared

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
more than 10 at once the su-35 appeared

more than 10 at once the su-35 appeared
now<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.660> question<00:02:21.930> remains<00:02:22.170> how<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.030> su-35

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030
