00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 I do not know how the new varnish us 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.599
 so that's the little mermaid game so that's 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.809
 a box with such a little mermaid is so playful 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.830
 which is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:18.170
 rubs a turtle and different here fun 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 shark some kind of flanders I understand 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.680
 is sebastian or sebastian somehow 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.730
 I do nâ€™t remember correctly 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 that again portrayed such a look what 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 inside well here's what on the other hand we are 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.579
 saw a clean white sheet tell us 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.640
 manufacturers 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:43.649
 like that chips were packed i nothing 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 changed me here so here they are packed it 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.370
 Exactly the chips thought of it in general 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 bag 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 unique saving level 90 and here 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.739
 this sound on the box we see and here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:03.690
 such a beautiful field my eyes 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.940
 yeah yeah well i think it's all here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.490
 clearly need to take on the review 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.990
 in rows on the table and because because 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.190
 where he spent there are no rules here this game 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.630
 without rules 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.300
 that's how you understand just go just 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.030
 roll a die and just keep it 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:32.160
 these arrows are wonderful i think that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.590
 we are waiting for a portion of the removal of the brain looking at 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.630
 These pictures but more about them I 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.830

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.100
 the lines

 why are they all with the same faces all 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 all in this picture are different characters and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.410

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:00.450
