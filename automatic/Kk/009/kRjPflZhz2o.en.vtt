think dedicating it again no I don't

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.660 
think dedicating it again no I don't
know<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.140> don't<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.619> doesn't<00:01:54.520> happen

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
know you don't and that doesn't happen

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.920 
know you don't and that doesn't happen
there<00:01:54.939> isn't<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.210> point<00:01:55.479> where<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.719> suddenly

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
there isn't a point where you suddenly

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.389 
there isn't a point where you suddenly
think<00:01:56.350> wow<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.740> looks<00:01:56.890> amazing

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
think wow this looks amazing

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.249 
think wow this looks amazing
there<00:01:57.850> wasn't<00:01:58.270> for<00:01:58.450> me<00:01:58.570> maybe<00:01:58.869> there<00:01:59.079> would<00:01:59.229> be

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
there wasn't for me maybe there would be

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.380 
there wasn't for me maybe there would be
for<00:01:59.619> somebody<00:01:59.950> else<00:02:00.130> but<00:02:00.369> for<00:02:00.460> me<00:02:00.520> no<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.060> the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
for somebody else but for me no and the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.029 
for somebody else but for me no and the
reason<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.719> didn't<00:02:02.109> happen<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.590> because<00:02:02.770> I

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
reason that didn't happen is because I

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.980 
reason that didn't happen is because I
rely<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.820> lot<00:02:04.060> on<00:02:04.270> my<00:02:05.049> facial<00:02:05.829> expressions<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
rely a lot on my facial expressions to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.290 
rely a lot on my facial expressions to
get<00:02:08.140> my<00:02:08.289> point<00:02:08.560> across<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.000> people

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
get my point across and so that people

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.600 
get my point across and so that people
know<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:11.290> I'm<00:02:11.470> not<00:02:11.680> being<00:02:11.920> serious<00:02:12.160> when<00:02:12.490> I'm

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
know that I'm not being serious when I'm

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.130 
know that I'm not being serious when I'm
being<00:02:12.760> sarcastic

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
being sarcastic

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.510 
being sarcastic
I<00:02:14.170> would<00:02:14.470> probably<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.890> my<00:02:15.040> head<00:02:15.190> kicked<00:02:15.430> in

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
I would probably get my head kicked in

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.180 
I would probably get my head kicked in
every<00:02:15.790> day<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:18.000> also<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.300> have<00:02:19.600> only<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.770> have

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
every day so and also I have only I have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.570 
every day so and also I have only I have
an<00:02:21.790> eye<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:23.440> slightly<00:02:24.010> lower<00:02:24.220> than<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
an eye that is slightly lower than the

other the angle of is slightly lower and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.950 
other the angle of is slightly lower and
what<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.220> didn't<00:02:27.460> appreciate<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.660> use

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
what I didn't appreciate is that I use

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.040 
what I didn't appreciate is that I use
this<00:02:29.140> muscle<00:02:29.500> here<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.980> lot<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.840> raise

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
this muscle here a lot so I can raise

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.870 
this muscle here a lot so I can raise
that<00:02:32.260> eyebrow<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.250> open<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.640> eye

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
that eyebrow so that I can open that eye

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.470 
that eyebrow so that I can open that eye
wider<00:02:34.920> when<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:35.950> had<00:02:36.190> Botox<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.760> numbed<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.240> it

wider when I had Botox it numbed that it

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.900 
wider when I had Botox it numbed that it
paralyzed<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.770> just<00:02:39.040> fell<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
paralyzed that and so this just fell so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.190 
paralyzed that and so this just fell so

and everything and it's lovely adds to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.040 
and everything and it's lovely adds to
it<00:03:24.130> but<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.910> didn't<00:03:25.150> happen<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.570> course<00:03:25.780> and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
it but that didn't happen of course and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.630 
it but that didn't happen of course and
what<00:03:26.500> happened<00:03:26.830> was<00:03:26.950> she<00:03:27.130> got<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.310> slightly

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
what happened was she got a slightly

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.060 
what happened was she got a slightly
dead-eyed<00:03:28.030> smile<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.870> because<00:03:29.860> these

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
dead-eyed smile and because these

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.920 
dead-eyed smile and because these
muscles<00:03:30.459> aren't<00:03:30.610> working<00:03:31.030> these<00:03:31.420> ones<00:03:31.690> work

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
muscles aren't working these ones work

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.600 
muscles aren't working these ones work
more<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.680> what<00:03:32.950> happened<00:03:33.280> was<00:03:33.430> when<00:03:33.580> she

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
more so what happened was when she

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.630 
more so what happened was when she
smiled<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.630> creased<00:03:34.989> across<00:03:35.320> here<00:03:35.560> which<00:03:36.100> to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
smiled it creased across here which to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.820 
smiled it creased across here which to
me<00:03:36.790> looked<00:03:37.000> slightly<00:03:37.540> strange<00:03:38.380> because<00:03:38.620> I

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
me looked slightly strange because I

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.080 
me looked slightly strange because I
know<00:03:38.890> what<00:03:39.070> my<00:03:39.190> sister<00:03:39.250> looks<00:03:39.610> like<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.000> she

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
know what my sister looks like and she

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.860 
know what my sister looks like and she
didn't<00:03:40.420> suddenly<00:03:40.600> look<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.410> same<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:43.570> I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
didn't suddenly look the same so I

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.930 
didn't suddenly look the same so I
suppose<00:03:44.860> what<00:03:45.070> I'm<00:03:45.220> saying<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:47.400> go<00:03:48.400> ahead<00:03:48.640> try

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
suppose what I'm saying is go ahead try

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.060 
suppose what I'm saying is go ahead try
if<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.239> want<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.660> I'm<00:03:49.959> not<00:03:50.350> saying<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.799> it's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
if you want to I'm not saying that it's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.530 
if you want to I'm not saying that it's
not<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.280> good<00:03:51.430> idea<00:03:51.549> I'm<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:51.970> saying<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.450> you
