00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 norman hugo the farm jÃ©rÃ´me mr life their 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.710
 videos are seen millions of times on 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.019
 Youtube 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 here they are now on stage but 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.139
 because the videos are still 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 they do the best a few 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.539
 all unpublished are projected on large 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.609
 screen 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 when you come out of an elevator with a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.449
 neighbor that's what I had goodbye 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.449
 thank you thank you thank you goodbye 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.739
 thank you for the videos but also the stand up 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:54.600
 and sketches together they wrote 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 two hours of show in valenciennes 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.410
 it was the first of eight dates on 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.030
 zapping means two is played at wickets 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.350
 long closed to making videos 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.879
 youtube and do the scene these two 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 different things but for us it's 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.880
 very interesting already to try some 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.259
 things on stage 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.700
 secondly to have the audience in front 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.149
 because unfortunately on on 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 Internet 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.080
 we only have the comments we do not have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.300
 at all the warm rapport whatever we 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 on a stage so that's where we are 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.690
 allows to be more than meet the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 public 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.890
 to eat because we hope to extend 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 rock'n'roll it's not on stage but 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.420
 we go 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.440
 go, you have to go two thousand 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.440
 people made the trip 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.760
 you will have them 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.810
 thanks to an often poetic humor that goes 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.509
 to sing a pasta recipe to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 the carbonara mayonnaise takes from 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.390
 of the young audience that for a month 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 called the Nazis 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 we are super happy to redo a 3 4 to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.190
 5 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:03.530
 as long as they want it's a super 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.479
 experience of the stars who are 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.670
 gathering could produce a real show 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.940
 and meet those who love them in 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.940
 true
