00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
possible but you know I felt like his

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.510 
possible but you know I felt like his
desire<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.630> extremely<00:00:57.630> high<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.950> started

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
desire was extremely high so I started

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.680 
desire was extremely high so I started
to<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.880> research<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> chocolate

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
to kind of research the chocolate

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
to kind of research the chocolate
industry<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.290> how<00:01:01.380> they<00:01:01.560> make<00:01:01.829> chocolate<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
industry and how they make chocolate the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.830 
industry and how they make chocolate the
old-fashioned<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.059> thought<00:01:03.329> why<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> want

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
old-fashioned way I thought why I want

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.380 
old-fashioned way I thought why I want
to<00:01:03.899> make<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.259> old-fashioned<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.390> put

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
to make it the old-fashioned way and put

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
to make it the old-fashioned way and put
a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> love<00:01:06.899> and<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.590> humility<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
a lot of love and a lot of humility and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.489 
a lot of love and a lot of humility and
a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> honor<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.479> sacredness<00:01:09.960> into<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:10.499 
a lot of honor and sacredness into it

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.249 
a lot of honor and sacredness into it
hence<00:01:10.829> sacred<00:01:11.280> chocolate<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.020> kind

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
hence sacred chocolate so we just kind

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.840 
hence sacred chocolate so we just kind
of<00:01:13.350> started<00:01:13.679> playing<00:01:13.920> around<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.399> kitchen<00:01:14.579> at

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
of started playing around the kitchen at

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.129 
of started playing around the kitchen at
first<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.329> then<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.539> thing<00:01:15.569> led<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:15.960> another

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
first and then one thing led to another

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.919 
first and then one thing led to another
and<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> chocolate<00:01:17.159> factory

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
and now we have a chocolate factory

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.719 
and now we have a chocolate factory
we've<00:01:18.929> really<00:01:19.590> i<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.950> spent<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.429> lot<00:01:20.579> of<00:01:20.609> time

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we've really i think spent a lot of time

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.809 
we've really i think spent a lot of time
studying<00:01:21.030> alchemy<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.109> the<00:01:22.609> sacredness<00:01:23.609> of

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
studying alchemy and the sacredness of

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.239 
studying alchemy and the sacredness of
metals<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.569> alchemical<00:01:25.259> metallic<00:01:25.770> art<00:01:26.069> of

ayurvedic alchemist the chinese

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.449 
ayurvedic alchemist the chinese
alchemist<00:01:31.319> we've<00:01:31.859> spent<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.249> tremendous

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
alchemist we've spent a tremendous

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.639 
alchemist we've spent a tremendous
amount<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.329> time<00:01:33.479> studying<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.259> field<00:01:34.469> of

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
amount of time studying the field of

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.870 
amount of time studying the field of
Ormus<00:01:35.249> which<00:01:35.969> is<00:01:36.560> obviously<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.979> more

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
Ormus which is obviously a more

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.269 
Ormus which is obviously a more
conventional<00:01:39.689> modern-day<00:01:40.590> understanding<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:41.279 
conventional modern-day understanding of

conventional modern-day understanding of
present-day<00:01:41.579> understanding<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.600> had

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
present-day understanding of what we had

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.199 
present-day understanding of what we had
in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> past<00:01:43.409> termed<00:01:43.709> alchemy<00:01:44.219> and<00:01:44.399> we're

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
in the past termed alchemy and we're

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.819 
in the past termed alchemy and we're
taking<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.259> knowledge<00:01:46.560> research<00:01:47.279> and

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
taking all that knowledge research and

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.010 
taking all that knowledge research and
inspiration<00:01:49.829> into<00:01:50.099> chocolate<00:01:51.060> making<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
inspiration into chocolate making now to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.769 
inspiration into chocolate making now to
really<00:01:52.590> create<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:53.130> chocolate<00:01:53.789> bar<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.539> the

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
really create the chocolate bar in the

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:55.999 
really create the chocolate bar in the
way<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.079> was<00:01:55.170> supposed<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.529> be<00:01:55.590> created

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
way that was supposed to be created

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
way that was supposed to be created
which<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.819> delivery<00:01:57.270> vehicle<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
which is the delivery vehicle for the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.559 
which is the delivery vehicle for the
