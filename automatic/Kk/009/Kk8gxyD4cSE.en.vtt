00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
today about is about filter defenses and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.140 
today about is about filter defenses and
basically<00:00:18.060> how<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:19.199> has<00:00:19.470> evolved<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
basically how it has evolved with the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.109 
basically how it has evolved with the
cannons<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.080> know<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.010> new<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.609> new<00:00:23.850> age

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
cannons you know the new the new age

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
cannons you know the new the new age
type<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.810> cannons<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.470> are<00:00:25.650> much<00:00:25.920> more

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
type of cannons that are much more

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
type of cannons that are much more
accurate<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.760> powerful<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.599> slap<00:00:27.869> busts

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
accurate and powerful and can slap busts

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.980 
accurate and powerful and can slap busts
and<00:00:28.470> stack<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> ton<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> sand<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.269> was<00:00:30.449> kind

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and stack a ton of sand so this was kind

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.410 
and stack a ton of sand so this was kind
of<00:00:31.109> pre<00:00:31.470> Lien's<00:00:31.949> cannon<00:00:32.399> defenses<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.239> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
of pre Lien's cannon defenses this is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
of pre Lien's cannon defenses this is
basically<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:35.010> working<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.489> is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
basically what I was working on is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.869 
basically what I was working on is
different<00:00:36.329> configurations<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.260> slabs<00:00:37.879> they

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
different configurations of slabs they

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
different configurations of slabs they
all<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.899> positives<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
all have kind of like positives and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.510 
all have kind of like positives and
negatives<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.340> basically<00:00:42.260> before<00:00:43.520> slab

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
negatives but basically before slab

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
negatives but basically before slab
busting<00:00:44.940> cannons<00:00:45.329> were<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:46.379> have

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
busting cannons were out you would have

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.310 
busting cannons were out you would have
to<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.210> blow<00:00:49.020> these

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to actually you know blow these

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
to actually you know blow these
scattered<00:00:49.890> these<00:00:50.039> slabs<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
scattered these slabs and it would be a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.479 
scattered these slabs and it would be a
nightmare<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.280> had

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
nightmare to you know if you had

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.020 
nightmare to you know if you had
different<00:00:54.559> slabs<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.890> different<00:00:56.280> Y<00:00:56.520> levels

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
different slabs at different Y levels

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
different slabs at different Y levels
you<00:00:57.420> would<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> remake<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.829> cannon

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you would have to remake your cannon

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.229 
you would have to remake your cannon
several<00:01:00.359> several<00:01:00.660> several<00:01:00.870> times<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
several several several times so this is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
several several several times so this is
all<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.619> pretty<00:01:04.769> slab<00:01:05.430> busting

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
all you know pretty pretty slab busting

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.020 
all you know pretty pretty slab busting
cannons<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.650> out<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> old<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.970> with

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
cannons so out with the old and in with

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.200 
cannons so out with the old and in with
the<00:01:09.390> new<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.549> we're<00:01:11.549> gonna<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.820> talking<00:01:12.030> about

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the new so we're gonna be talking about

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.050 
the new so we're gonna be talking about
filter<00:01:12.840> defenses<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.100> basically<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.640> filter

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
filter defenses so basically what filter

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.010 
filter defenses so basically what filter
defenses<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.880> Minecraft<00:01:18.659> faction

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
defenses are is it's a Minecraft faction

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.609 
defenses are is it's a Minecraft faction
defense<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.740> basically<00:01:20.340> stops<00:01:21.200> or<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
defense that basically stops or it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.980 
defense that basically stops or it
disconnects<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> sand<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.150> tea<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.390> tea<00:01:24.720> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
disconnects the sand in tea and tea so

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.310 
disconnects the sand in tea and tea so
basically<00:01:25.740> vertical<00:01:26.310> walls<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.810> almost

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
basically vertical walls they do almost

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
basically vertical walls they do almost
absolutely<00:01:29.189> nothing<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.090> perfect

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
absolutely nothing it's a perfect

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
absolutely nothing it's a perfect
environment<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.320> sand<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> tea<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> tea<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
environment for sand and tea and tea to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.010 
environment for sand and tea and tea to
land<00:01:33.450> together<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.939> yeah<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:36.930> what

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
land together and yeah so that's what

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.850 
land together and yeah so that's what
most<00:01:37.320> people<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.610> cuts<00:01:39.860> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
most people use then there are cuts you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.370 
most people use then there are cuts you
know<00:01:40.979> every<00:01:41.460> filter<00:01:41.729> defense<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.259> gonna

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
know every filter defense what I'm gonna

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
know every filter defense what I'm gonna
be<00:01:43.530> talking<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.790> always<00:01:45.479> gonna<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
be talking about it is always gonna have

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.859 
be talking about it is always gonna have
positives<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.890> negatives<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.780> what<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
positives and negatives because what you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.530 
positives and negatives because what you
have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.350> about<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.799> each<00:01:50.509> type<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
have to think about is each type of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.130 
have to think about is each type of
defense<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.560> aimed<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> certain<00:01:53.939> cannon<00:01:54.509> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
defense is aimed at a certain cannon so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.100 
defense is aimed at a certain cannon so
so<00:01:55.860> basically<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.450> variety<00:01:57.659> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so basically you want a variety of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.090 
so basically you want a variety of
filter<00:01:58.619> defenses<00:01:59.159> because<00:02:00.380> no<00:02:01.380> filter

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
filter defenses because no filter

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.560 
filter defenses because no filter
defense<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> best<00:02:03.240> because

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
defense is going to be the best because

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
defense is going to be the best because
all<00:02:04.049> cannons<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:05.100> specific<00:02:06.110> trajectories

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
all cannons have specific trajectories

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.750 
all cannons have specific trajectories
of<00:02:07.640> power<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.289> abilities<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of power you know abilities so you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.990 
of power you know abilities so you
really<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.770> make<00:02:13.770> sure<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
really have to make sure you have you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.949 
really have to make sure you have you
have<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> variety<00:02:15.599> time<00:02:19.250> okay<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.660> these<00:02:21.660> are

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
have a variety time okay so these are

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.440 
have a variety time okay so these are
obviously<00:02:22.470> cuts<00:02:22.890> these<00:02:23.580> were<00:02:23.819> really<00:02:24.300> really

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
obviously cuts these were really really

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.949 
obviously cuts these were really really
good<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> beginning<00:02:26.640> stages<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
good in the beginning stages of the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.350 
good in the beginning stages of the
higher<00:02:28.200> level<00:02:28.590> cannons<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.879> stack<00:02:30.330> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
higher level cannons that can stack a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.750 
higher level cannons that can stack a
lot<00:02:30.690> because<00:02:31.080> they<00:02:31.290> basically<00:02:31.760> they

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
lot because they basically they

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.320 
lot because they basically they
disconnect<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:34.050> slab<00:02:34.709> busting<00:02:35.400> part<00:02:35.819> like

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
disconnect the slab busting part like

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.410 
disconnect the slab busting part like
the<00:02:36.480> hammer<00:02:36.750> TNT<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:38.280> was<00:02:38.489> always<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.209> little

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the hammer TNT it was always up a little

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.839 
the hammer TNT it was always up a little
bit<00:02:39.599> higher<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.590> sand<00:02:40.890> always<00:02:41.580> got

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
bit higher and then the sand always got

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.240 
bit higher and then the sand always got
a<00:02:41.879> little<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.420> lower<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:42.750> they<00:02:43.200> never<00:02:43.379> never

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
a little bit lower and they never never

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.570 
a little bit lower and they never never
could<00:02:44.519> actually<00:02:44.760> push<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.300> down<00:02:45.629> all<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.989> way

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
could actually push it down all the way

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.430 
could actually push it down all the way
I'm<00:02:47.580> talking<00:02:47.970> about<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.330> unmodified<00:02:49.080> version

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
I'm talking about the unmodified version

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.150 
I'm talking about the unmodified version
of<00:02:49.950> lean<00:02:50.129> archers<00:02:50.580> cannon<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> yeah<00:02:52.650> cuts<00:02:53.010> are

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
of lean archers cannon so yeah cuts are

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.009 
of lean archers cannon so yeah cuts are
good<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:53.879> like<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.540> said<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:57.390> really

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
good but like I said it's it's really

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.040 
good but like I said it's it's really
not<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.560> best<00:02:59.090> especially<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> modified

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
not the best especially for a modified

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.140 
not the best especially for a modified
version<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.739> you're<00:03:02.310> gonna<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.610> positives

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
version so you're gonna have positives

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.149 
version so you're gonna have positives
and<00:03:03.300> negatives<00:03:03.629> you<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:04.019> have<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.319> have<00:03:05.129> a

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
and negatives you really have to have a

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.830 
and negatives you really have to have a
variety<00:03:05.489> like<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.090> said<00:03:06.300> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
variety like I said so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.540 
variety like I said so
this<00:03:07.260> right<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.769> basically<00:03:08.010> kind<00:03:08.459> of

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
this right here is basically kind of

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.490 
this right here is basically kind of
like<00:03:08.730> pancakes<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.659> I<00:03:09.690> would<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:10.140> is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
like pancakes and what I would do is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.820 
like pancakes and what I would do is
basically<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:12.209> break<00:03:12.480> these<00:03:12.690> blocks<00:03:13.080> so

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
basically just break these blocks so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.030 
basically just break these blocks so
when<00:03:14.670> they<00:03:14.879> if<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.569> do<00:03:16.019> want<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.470> go<00:03:16.650> through

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
when they if they do want to go through

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.770 
when they if they do want to go through
the<00:03:17.159> entire<00:03:17.459> defense<00:03:17.879> if<00:03:18.150> they<00:03:18.269> want<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> break

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
the entire defense if they want to break

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140 
the entire defense if they want to break
through<00:03:19.050> each<00:03:19.319> level<00:03:19.709> at<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> time<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:21.000> would

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
through each level at a time they would

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.229 
through each level at a time they would
have<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.540> actually<00:03:22.290> stack<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.909> block

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
have to actually stack on a one block

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.110 
have to actually stack on a one block
and<00:03:24.599> that's<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.739> not<00:03:25.950> super<00:03:26.400> difficult<00:03:26.549> but

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
and that's it's not super difficult but

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.229 
and that's it's not super difficult but
it<00:03:27.450> does<00:03:27.840> take<00:03:28.610> quite<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.700> bit<00:03:29.879> of<00:03:29.940> knowledge

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
it does take quite a bit of knowledge

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.110 
it does take quite a bit of knowledge
and<00:03:30.750> know-how<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.349> just<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:32.010> lot<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.519> patience

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
and know-how and just a lot of patience

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.740 
and know-how and just a lot of patience
and<00:03:33.209> TNT

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
and TNT

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.160 
and TNT
a<00:03:33.989> lot<00:03:34.379> of<00:03:34.530> TNT<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:36.450> right<00:03:36.690> here<00:03:36.750> this

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
a lot of TNT so this right here this

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.580 
a lot of TNT so this right here this
filter<00:03:37.590> defense<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.159> two<00:03:39.000> blocks<00:03:39.330> air<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.409> of

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
filter defense is two blocks air and of

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.250 
filter defense is two blocks air and of
course<00:03:40.860> you'd<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.720> watered<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.080> very

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
course you'd have watered on the very

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.530 
course you'd have watered on the very
bottom<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:44.010> top<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.790> guys<00:03:44.909> obviously<00:03:45.269> I

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
bottom and top you guys obviously I

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.619 
bottom and top you guys obviously I
shouldn't<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.290> say<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:47.360> yeah<00:03:48.360> this

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
shouldn't have to say that but yeah this

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.880 
shouldn't have to say that but yeah this
is<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.409> basically<00:03:50.159> kind<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.540> know<00:03:51.890> like

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
is for a basically kind of you know like

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.110 
is for a basically kind of you know like
the<00:03:53.220> standard<00:03:53.909> lanes<00:03:54.209> cannon<00:03:54.810> because<00:03:55.230> it

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the standard lanes cannon because it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.550 
the standard lanes cannon because it
stacks<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.450> through<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.810> four

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
stacks and through a four

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.660 
stacks and through a four
4x1<00:04:00.459> hole<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.410> actually<00:04:03.100> perfect

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
4x1 hole so so this is actually perfect

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.790 
4x1 hole so so this is actually perfect
for<00:04:03.819> those<00:04:04.330> type<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.660> cannons<00:04:05.110> but<00:04:05.290> once<00:04:05.620> you

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
for those type of cannons but once you

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.190 
for those type of cannons but once you
start<00:04:06.160> getting<00:04:06.430> into<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:06.970> more<00:04:07.750> powerful

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
start getting into the more powerful

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.080 
start getting into the more powerful
types<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.890> cannons<00:04:09.220> you<00:04:09.310> actually<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.940> to

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
types of cannons you actually have to

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.130 
types of cannons you actually have to
reduce<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.569> cap<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:13.450> might<00:04:13.660> want<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.990> do

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
reduce that cap and you might want to do

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.680 
reduce that cap and you might want to do
something<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.880> there's<00:04:15.880> different

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
something like this there's different

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.810 
something like this there's different
varieties<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:17.230> can<00:04:17.590> use<00:04:17.739> slabs<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.549> can<00:04:18.700> do

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
varieties you can use slabs you can do

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.650 
varieties you can use slabs you can do
stairs<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:20.650> goes<00:04:20.829> on<00:04:21.070> forever<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:22.000> these

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
stairs it goes on forever like these

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.370 
stairs it goes on forever like these
types<00:04:23.139> of<00:04:23.350> filters<00:04:23.910> were<00:04:24.910> really<00:04:25.300> good<00:04:25.540> this

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
types of filters were really good this

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.940 
types of filters were really good this
one<00:04:26.620> especially<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.990> cannons<00:04:29.380> don't<00:04:29.680> use

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
one especially if the cannons don't use

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.880 
one especially if the cannons don't use
the<00:04:30.250> realigning<00:04:30.940> with<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> Pistons<00:04:31.810> or<00:04:32.169> TNT

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
the realigning with the Pistons or TNT

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.550 
the realigning with the Pistons or TNT
realigning<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:34.600> was<00:04:34.750> really<00:04:35.080> good<00:04:35.290> for<00:04:35.500> a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
realigning that was really good for a

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.090 
realigning that was really good for a
long<00:04:35.800> time<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:37.630> stopped<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.410> lot<00:04:38.860> of

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
long time that that stopped a lot of

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.480 
long time that that stopped a lot of
people<00:04:39.400> but<00:04:39.700> as<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:41.080> cannons<00:04:41.470> have<00:04:41.710> evolved

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
people but as the cannons have evolved

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.480 
people but as the cannons have evolved
these<00:04:42.850> these<00:04:43.540> type<00:04:43.780> of<00:04:43.810> filters<00:04:44.380> were<00:04:44.950> not

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
these these type of filters were not

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.790 
these these type of filters were not
very<00:04:45.760> good<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.180> begin<00:04:46.300> with<00:04:46.690> but<00:04:46.960> they<00:04:47.470> still

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
very good to begin with but they still

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.870 
very good to begin with but they still
you<00:04:48.130> know<00:04:48.160> they<00:04:48.280> still<00:04:48.700> have<00:04:48.760> their<00:04:49.270> uses<00:04:50.880> you

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
you know they still have their uses you

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.010 
you know they still have their uses you
know<00:04:52.030> with<00:04:52.660> different<00:04:53.440> types<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.800> cannons<00:04:54.190> so

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
know with different types of cannons so

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.710 
know with different types of cannons so
all<00:04:56.020> in<00:04:56.320> all<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:57.370> there's<00:04:57.729> lots<00:04:58.180> of<00:04:58.360> different

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
all in all you there's lots of different

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.230 
all in all you there's lots of different
types<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.290> configurations<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.880> can<00:05:00.910> use

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
types of configurations you can use

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.840 
types of configurations you can use
upside-down<00:05:01.750> slabs<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:02.950> can<00:05:03.100> do<00:05:03.250> stairs

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
upside-down slabs so you can do stairs

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.900 
upside-down slabs so you can do stairs
and<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:05.470> guess<00:05:05.710> we<00:05:05.919> will<00:05:06.070> look<00:05:06.280> at<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.610> stairs

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
and I guess we will look at the stairs

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.260 
and I guess we will look at the stairs
and<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.419> little<00:05:07.690> bit<00:05:07.919> alright<00:05:08.919> guys<00:05:09.190> so<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:10.090> make

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
and a little bit alright guys so to make

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.409 
and a little bit alright guys so to make
a<00:05:10.540> modified<00:05:11.500> version<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:12.400> lean<00:05:12.640> arch<00:05:12.880> cannon

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
a modified version of lean arch cannon

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.630 
a modified version of lean arch cannon
is<00:05:13.540> basically<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.229> put<00:05:14.440> upside-down<00:05:14.979> slabs

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
is basically you put upside-down slabs

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.010 
is basically you put upside-down slabs
on<00:05:16.000> these<00:05:16.810> three<00:05:17.169> blocks<00:05:17.380> right<00:05:17.710> here<00:05:17.950> so

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
on these three blocks right here so

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.570 
on these three blocks right here so
basically<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.380> just<00:05:20.410> changes<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.370> trajectory

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
basically it just changes the trajectory

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.480 
basically it just changes the trajectory
a<00:05:22.030> little<00:05:22.330> bit<00:05:22.510> so<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.930> TNT<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.530> sand<00:05:23.979> are

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
a little bit so the TNT and sand are

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.840 
a little bit so the TNT and sand are
just<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.360> little<00:05:25.630> bit<00:05:25.870> closer<00:05:26.260> and<00:05:26.740> it's<00:05:27.550> much

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
just a little bit closer and it's much

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.870 
just a little bit closer and it's much
more<00:05:28.120> effective<00:05:28.660> when<00:05:28.930> actually<00:05:29.700> stacking<00:05:30.700> on

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
more effective when actually stacking on

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.520 
more effective when actually stacking on
smaller<00:05:31.360> surfaces<00:05:32.080> like<00:05:32.470> stairs<00:05:34.169> regular<00:05:35.169> one

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
smaller surfaces like stairs regular one

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.760 
smaller surfaces like stairs regular one
blocks<00:05:36.100> like<00:05:36.370> a<00:05:36.400> cut<00:05:36.789> or<00:05:37.180> any<00:05:37.930> other<00:05:38.320> type<00:05:38.620> of

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
blocks like a cut or any other type of

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.500 
blocks like a cut or any other type of
filter<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.100> want<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.610> use<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:40.120> modified

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
filter you want to use a modified

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.560 
filter you want to use a modified
version<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:41.289> lean<00:05:41.530> arches<00:05:41.860> cannon<00:05:42.220> so<00:05:42.729> here<00:05:43.450> we

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
version of lean arches cannon so here we

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.650 
version of lean arches cannon so here we
go<00:05:43.919> this<00:05:44.919> is<00:05:44.950> what<00:05:45.130> happens<00:05:45.910> when<00:05:46.300> you<00:05:46.450> use

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
go this is what happens when you use

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.260 
go this is what happens when you use
stairs<00:05:47.080> we<00:05:47.950> can<00:05:48.100> probably<00:05:48.370> change<00:05:48.669> it<00:05:48.910> to

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
stairs we can probably change it to

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.680 
stairs we can probably change it to
regular<00:05:49.630> blocks<00:05:50.080> just<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.770> show<00:05:50.950> you<00:05:51.010> guys<00:05:51.690> it

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
regular blocks just to show you guys it

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.070 
regular blocks just to show you guys it
does<00:05:53.110> stacks<00:05:53.530> and<00:05:53.830> but<00:05:54.130> when<00:05:54.340> you<00:05:54.460> use<00:05:54.610> stairs

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
does stacks and but when you use stairs

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.279 
does stacks and but when you use stairs
it<00:05:56.080> actually<00:05:56.560> doesn't

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
it actually doesn't

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.809 
it actually doesn't
a<00:05:59.629> little<00:06:00.629> too<00:06:00.749> much<00:06:01.249> so<00:06:02.249> it<00:06:02.339> just<00:06:02.520> kind<00:06:02.759> of

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
a little too much so it just kind of

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.350 
a little too much so it just kind of
slings<00:06:03.749> down<00:06:04.249> I've<00:06:05.249> had<00:06:05.610> it<00:06:05.759> where<00:06:05.999> I<00:06:06.029> can

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
slings down I've had it where I can

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.589 
slings down I've had it where I can
actually<00:06:06.719> stack<00:06:07.399> probably<00:06:08.399> about<00:06:08.580> I<00:06:08.999> don't

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
actually stack probably about I don't

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.079 
actually stack probably about I don't
know<00:06:09.809> a<00:06:10.110> third<00:06:10.529> of<00:06:10.889> the<00:06:11.099> sand<00:06:11.369> so<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.879> does

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.089 
know a third of the sand so it does

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.469 
know a third of the sand so it does
reduce<00:06:12.419> the<00:06:13.229> overall<00:06:13.740> sand<00:06:14.369> stacked<00:06:14.819> you<00:06:15.360> have

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
reduce the overall sand stacked you have

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.959 
reduce the overall sand stacked you have
to<00:06:15.599> have<00:06:15.719> the<00:06:15.899> perfect<00:06:16.469> timing<00:06:16.710> on<00:06:17.039> the<00:06:17.520> hammer

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
to have the perfect timing on the hammer

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.499 
to have the perfect timing on the hammer
and<00:06:18.389> the<00:06:19.259> perfect<00:06:19.680> placement<00:06:19.889> of<00:06:20.339> the<00:06:20.580> sand<00:06:20.939> to

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
and the perfect placement of the sand to

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.559 
and the perfect placement of the sand to
actually<00:06:21.960> get<00:06:22.169> it<00:06:22.289> to<00:06:22.319> stack<00:06:22.999> perfectly<00:06:23.999> on

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
actually get it to stack perfectly on

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.809 
actually get it to stack perfectly on
the<00:06:24.779> same<00:06:24.990> block<00:06:25.259> downwards<00:06:25.830> so<00:06:26.430> keep<00:06:26.610> that<00:06:26.759> in

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
the same block downwards so keep that in

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.100 
the same block downwards so keep that in
mind<00:06:26.939> I<00:06:27.509> would<00:06:27.779> use<00:06:28.699> being<00:06:29.699> SADS<00:06:30.059> cannon<00:06:30.779> it's

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
mind I would use being SADS cannon it's

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.519 
mind I would use being SADS cannon it's
more<00:06:31.349> powerful<00:06:31.559> more<00:06:32.339> accurate<00:06:32.849> or<00:06:33.059> a

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
more powerful more accurate or a

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.049 
more powerful more accurate or a
different<00:06:34.529> type<00:06:34.740> of<00:06:34.770> cannon<00:06:35.189> that's<00:06:35.430> just<00:06:35.819> a

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:36.059 
different type of cannon that's just a

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.499 
different type of cannon that's just a
upgraded<00:06:36.869> version<00:06:37.770> of<00:06:38.009> leaner<00:06:38.459> cannon<00:06:38.969> two

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
upgraded version of leaner cannon two

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.679 
upgraded version of leaner cannon two
stacks<00:06:39.930> and<00:06:40.229> on<00:06:40.559> cuts<00:06:40.949> or<00:06:41.279> stairs<00:06:41.610> or<00:06:42.059> whatever

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
stacks and on cuts or stairs or whatever

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:46.760 
stacks and on cuts or stairs or whatever
upside-down<00:06:43.409> slabs<00:06:43.860> or<00:06:44.129> whatever<00:06:44.430> so<00:06:45.349> yep<00:06:46.349> so

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
upside-down slabs or whatever so yep so

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.639 
upside-down slabs or whatever so yep so
I'll<00:06:46.889> show<00:06:47.099> you<00:06:47.129> guys<00:06:47.249> how<00:06:47.399> to<00:06:47.669> break<00:06:48.029> this

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:48.649 
I'll show you guys how to break this

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.739 
I'll show you guys how to break this
break<00:06:49.649> the<00:06:49.770> stairs<00:06:50.039> right<00:06:50.789> now<00:06:50.849> what<00:06:51.629> I've

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:51.749 
break the stairs right now what I've

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:54.790 
break the stairs right now what I've
noticed<00:06:52.020> actually<00:06:52.740> it<00:06:52.979> does<00:06:53.309> it<00:06:53.849> does

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
noticed actually it does it does

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.459 
noticed actually it does it does
disconnect<00:06:55.800> the<00:06:55.949> sand<00:06:56.249> fairly<00:06:56.879> well<00:06:57.089> but<00:06:57.959> the

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:58.469 
disconnect the sand fairly well but the

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.279 
disconnect the sand fairly well but the
thing<00:06:58.499> is<00:06:58.949> it<00:06:59.369> can<00:06:59.580> easily<00:07:00.059> be<00:07:00.240> broken<00:07:00.289> broken

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
thing is it can easily be broken broken

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.980 
thing is it can easily be broken broken
if<00:07:01.680> you<00:07:01.740> find<00:07:02.309> the<00:07:02.490> right<00:07:02.669> trajectory<00:07:02.990> the

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
if you find the right trajectory the

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.509 
if you find the right trajectory the
right<00:07:04.169> amount<00:07:04.529> in<00:07:04.620> power<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.159> the<00:07:05.339> right

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:05.519 
right amount in power and the right

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:08.209 
right amount in power and the right
angle<00:07:06.029> you<00:07:06.269> can<00:07:06.870> actually<00:07:07.080> break<00:07:07.589> these<00:07:07.830> types

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
angle you can actually break these types

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:12.110 
angle you can actually break these types
of<00:07:08.580> filter<00:07:09.269> defenses<00:07:09.809> so<00:07:10.399> this<00:07:11.399> is<00:07:11.580> like<00:07:11.909> a

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
of filter defenses so this is like a

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.980 
of filter defenses so this is like a
stair<00:07:12.629> cut<00:07:13.259> and<00:07:13.819> it<00:07:14.819> works<00:07:15.149> it<00:07:15.449> actually<00:07:15.809> works

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
stair cut and it works it actually works

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.699 
stair cut and it works it actually works
pretty<00:07:16.139> well<00:07:16.439> but<00:07:17.370> like<00:07:17.759> I<00:07:17.939> said<00:07:18.409> I'll<00:07:19.409> show

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:19.709 
pretty well but like I said I'll show

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:21.619 
pretty well but like I said I'll show
you<00:07:19.769> guys<00:07:20.009> you<00:07:20.339> can<00:07:20.490> actually<00:07:20.849> break<00:07:21.059> it<00:07:21.300> very

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:21.629 
you guys you can actually break it very

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:23.779 
you guys you can actually break it very
easily<00:07:21.899> it<00:07:22.680> takes<00:07:22.860> a<00:07:23.009> little<00:07:23.189> bit<00:07:23.309> of<00:07:23.550> testing

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
easily it takes a little bit of testing

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.239 
easily it takes a little bit of testing
to<00:07:24.269> find<00:07:24.509> the<00:07:24.659> right<00:07:24.809> angle<00:07:25.019> and<00:07:25.469> right<00:07:25.979> amount

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:26.249 
to find the right angle and right amount

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:30.679 
to find the right angle and right amount
of<00:07:26.309> power<00:07:26.719> but<00:07:27.719> as<00:07:27.959> you<00:07:28.619> can<00:07:28.740> see<00:07:29.180> stairs<00:07:30.180> are

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:30.689 
of power but as you can see stairs are

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:34.820 
of power but as you can see stairs are
not<00:07:30.930> completely<00:07:31.439> 100%<00:07:32.039> safe<00:07:32.809> I<00:07:33.809> will<00:07:34.169> do<00:07:34.529> an

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
not completely 100% safe I will do an

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.109 
not completely 100% safe I will do an
update<00:07:34.979> video<00:07:35.729> on<00:07:35.969> the<00:07:36.930> next<00:07:37.379> kind<00:07:37.740> of

00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:38.119 
update video on the next kind of

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:42.529 
update video on the next kind of
evolution<00:07:39.119> of<00:07:39.680> filter<00:07:40.680> defenses<00:07:41.249> some<00:07:42.180> really

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 
evolution of filter defenses some really

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:45.079 
evolution of filter defenses some really
good<00:07:42.659> ones<00:07:42.809> out<00:07:43.110> there<00:07:43.319> so<00:07:43.709> stay<00:07:44.699> tuned<00:07:44.909> for
