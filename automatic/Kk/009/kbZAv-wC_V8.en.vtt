hi<00:00:10.380> welcome<00:00:10.590> back<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.830> cold<00:00:11.340> seo.com<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.270> are

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
hi welcome back to cold seo.com we are

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.660 
hi welcome back to cold seo.com we are
going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.780> answer<00:00:12.930> another<00:00:13.740> very<00:00:14.460> common

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
going to answer another very common

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.700 
going to answer another very common
question<00:00:15.180> that<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.390> get<00:00:15.570> especially<00:00:16.560> when

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
question that we get especially when

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.960 
question that we get especially when
talking<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.040> the<00:00:17.280> difference<00:00:17.550> between<00:00:17.610> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
talking about the difference between the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.019 
talking about the difference between the
DTG<00:00:18.360> viper<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.410> m2<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.610> is<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
DTG viper and the m2 and that is the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.580 
DTG viper and the m2 and that is the
print<00:00:21.420> speed<00:00:21.690> one<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> best<00:00:22.290> things<00:00:22.500> about

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
print speed one of the best things about

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
print speed one of the best things about
the<00:00:22.860> m2<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.460> prints<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.910> much<00:00:24.090> faster

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the m2 is that it prints so much faster

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.240 
the m2 is that it prints so much faster
so<00:00:25.080> we're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> simple<00:00:25.860> design

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
so we're going to take a simple design

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.640 
so we're going to take a simple design
on<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> white<00:00:27.330> shirt<00:00:27.630> which<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.050> very<00:00:28.290> common

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
on a white shirt which is very common

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.310 
on a white shirt which is very common
application<00:00:29.210> just<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.329> this<00:00:30.480> we're<00:00:31.230> going

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
application just like this we're going

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920 
application just like this we're going
to<00:00:31.410> print<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.650> out<00:00:31.770> on<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:32.310> Viper<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:33.120> two

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to print it out on the Viper first two

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.970 
to print it out on the Viper first two
prints<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:34.470> we're<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.740> do<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
prints and then we're going to do the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
prints and then we're going to do the
same<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> m2<00:00:35.760> come<00:00:36.480> closer<00:00:36.750> we'll<00:00:36.989> get

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
same to the m2 come closer we'll get

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
same to the m2 come closer we'll get
started<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.590> hit<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> start<00:00:38.100> button<00:00:38.390> just

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
started now hit the start button just

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.760 
started now hit the start button just
going<00:00:39.630> to<00:00:39.810> come<00:00:39.989> over<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.380> right<00:00:40.739> click

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
going to come over here and right click

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.750 
going to come over here and right click
on<00:00:41.130> this<00:00:41.220> design<00:00:43.190> I'm<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> hit<00:00:44.460> print

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
on this design I'm going to hit print

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:57.470 
on this design I'm going to hit print
and<00:00:45.649> then<00:00:46.649> start<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> timer

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 

so<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.170> two<00:00:58.350> prints<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.710> done<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.130> as<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so these two prints are done and as you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.240 
so these two prints are done and as you
can<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.330> took<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:01.260> over<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> half

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
can see it took just over two and a half

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.630 
can see it took just over two and a half
minutes<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> once<00:01:05.100> again<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> most

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
minutes so once again one of the most

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
minutes so once again one of the most
common<00:01:06.090> questions<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
common questions that we get about the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.410 
common questions that we get about the
DTG<00:01:08.010> printer<00:01:08.310> line<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> called<00:01:08.850> se<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
DTG printer line when you called se in

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.440 
DTG printer line when you called se in
particular<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.260> m2<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.890> how<00:01:11.490> fast<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
particular the m2 is how fast is it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090 
particular the m2 is how fast is it
because<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> course<00:01:13.290> how<00:01:13.530> fast<00:01:13.800> you<00:01:13.979> can

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
because of course how fast you can

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.500 
because of course how fast you can
printer<00:01:14.370> shirk<00:01:14.580> relates<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> how<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.330> money

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
printer shirk relates to how much money

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.180 
printer shirk relates to how much money
you<00:01:15.690> can<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.620> what<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.010> do

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
you can make so what we're going to do

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.250 
you can make so what we're going to do
is<00:01:17.460> we're<00:01:17.760> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> print<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> simple

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
is we're going to print out a simple

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.440 
is we're going to print out a simple
design<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> white<00:01:20.190> shirt<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:21.240> are<00:01:21.360> going

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
design on a white shirt and we are going

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
design on a white shirt and we are going
to<00:01:21.540> check<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.870> speed<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> print<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.650> two

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to check the speed to print out two

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
to check the speed to print out two
copies<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.510> do<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
copies so all I'm going to do now to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
copies so all I'm going to do now to
start<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> print<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.160> I'm<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> right

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
start the print is I'm going to right

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.420 
start the print is I'm going to right
click<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.270> design<00:01:29.390> hit<00:01:30.390> print<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:32.009> start

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
click on the design hit print and start

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:44.469 
click on the design hit print and start
the<00:01:32.550> timeline

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.749 

so<00:01:45.049> these<00:01:45.170> two<00:01:45.380> shirts<00:01:45.590> took<00:01:45.920> one<00:01:46.130> minute<00:01:46.250> 15

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
so these two shirts took one minute 15

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.270 
so these two shirts took one minute 15
seconds<00:01:47.119> to<00:01:47.270> print<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.649> we<00:01:48.680> just<00:01:48.920> completed

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
seconds to print so we just completed

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160 
seconds to print so we just completed
the<00:01:49.430> speed<00:01:49.670> test<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.509> competition<00:01:51.049> between

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the speed test the competition between

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.270 
the speed test the competition between
the<00:01:51.350> DTG<00:01:51.829> viper

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the DTG viper

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.209 
the DTG viper
and<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.820> m2<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.320> white<00:01:54.500> shirts<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.100> what

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
and the m2 on the white shirts and what

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.429 
and the m2 on the white shirts and what
we<00:01:55.340> found<00:01:55.520> was<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.360> m2<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.780> literally

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
we found was is the m2 is literally

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.740 
we found was is the m2 is literally
twice<00:01:57.799> as<00:01:58.039> fast<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:59.000> Viper<00:01:59.210> printed<00:01:59.630> out

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
twice as fast the Viper printed out

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.660 
twice as fast the Viper printed out
these<00:01:59.929> two<00:02:00.170> prints<00:02:00.470> in<00:02:00.829> two<00:02:01.069> minutes<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.429> 30

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
these two prints in two minutes and 30

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.450 
these two prints in two minutes and 30
seconds<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.170> m2<00:02:03.649> printed<00:02:04.039> out<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.250> same

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
seconds and the m2 printed out the same

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.429 
seconds and the m2 printed out the same
images<00:02:04.909> maybe<00:02:05.479> even<00:02:05.750> looking<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.170> little<00:02:06.259> bit

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
images maybe even looking a little bit

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.859 
images maybe even looking a little bit
better<00:02:06.679> in<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.670> minute<00:02:07.909> 15<00:02:08.060> seconds

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
better in a minute 15 seconds

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.320 
better in a minute 15 seconds
twice<00:02:09.530> as<00:02:09.739> fast<00:02:10.009> means<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.819> make<00:02:10.970> twice<00:02:11.269> as
