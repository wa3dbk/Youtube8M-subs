00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
eye cooler and I just wanted to show you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.409 
eye cooler and I just wanted to show you
how<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> mounted<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.019> and<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.980> may<00:00:23.339> be<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.970> bad

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
how I mounted it and it may be a bad

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.839 
how I mounted it and it may be a bad
idea<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.589> configuration<00:00:26.070> anyway<00:00:26.789> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
idea with this configuration anyway to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.950 
idea with this configuration anyway to
mount<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.539> radiator<00:00:28.259> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> front<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> what

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
mount the radiator in the front so what

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
mount the radiator in the front so what
happens<00:00:31.380> when<00:00:31.499> you<00:00:31.650> mount<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.130> radiator<00:00:32.430> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
happens when you mount the radiator in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.470 
happens when you mount the radiator in
the<00:00:32.850> front<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.900> hard<00:00:34.410> drive<00:00:34.880> trays<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.270> not

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the front the hard drive trays are not

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
the front the hard drive trays are not
going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.720> have<00:00:36.870> enough<00:00:37.170> room<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.800> sit<00:00:38.280> where

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
going to have enough room to sit where

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.120 
going to have enough room to sit where
they're<00:00:38.820> supposed<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> sit<00:00:39.810> there<00:00:40.130> slightly

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
they're supposed to sit there slightly

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.920 
they're supposed to sit there slightly
to<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.460> left<00:00:41.790> where<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.330> should<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.690> right

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to the left where this should be right

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.620 
to the left where this should be right
here<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.580> don't<00:00:44.790> know<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> could<00:00:45.270> hear

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
here but I don't know if you could hear

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.430 
here but I don't know if you could hear
the<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> sound<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.480> making<00:00:48.930> let<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.230> try<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the the sound it's making let me try to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
the the sound it's making let me try to
move<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.310> mic<00:00:50.550> there

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:08.510 

so<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.380> hold<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.600> sound<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> God

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.120 

so<00:01:09.520> I'm<00:01:10.180> probably<00:01:10.509> just<00:01:10.810> gonna<00:01:11.140> move<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
so I'm probably just gonna move the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:21.230 
so I'm probably just gonna move the
radiator<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:14.229> top<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.430> way<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:20.190> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
radiator on top and do it that way so I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.350 
radiator on top and do it that way so I
can't<00:01:22.240> move<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.840> hard<00:01:23.200> drive<00:01:23.500> tray<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:25.030> to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
can't move the hard drive tray more to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.219 
can't move the hard drive tray more to
the<00:01:25.509> back<00:01:25.720> because<00:01:25.960> there's<00:01:26.440> actually<00:01:28.229> rails

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
the back because there's actually rails

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.370 
the back because there's actually rails
that<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.610> could<00:01:30.820> move<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.299> hard<00:01:31.869> drive<00:01:32.110> train

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
that you could move the hard drive train

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.070 
that you could move the hard drive train
more<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.950> way<00:01:33.190> but<00:01:33.909> my<00:01:34.210> power<00:01:34.479> supply<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
more this way but my power supply the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.840 
more this way but my power supply the
EVGA<00:01:36.180> 1000<00:01:37.180> g2<00:01:37.509> is<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:38.069> little<00:01:39.069> longer<00:01:39.460> than<00:01:39.759> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
EVGA 1000 g2 is a little longer than the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.290 
EVGA 1000 g2 is a little longer than the
usual<00:01:39.880> power<00:01:40.450> supply<00:01:40.869> so<00:01:41.289> I<00:01:41.649> believe<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.819> rail

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
usual power supply so I believe the rail

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.279 
usual power supply so I believe the rail
is<00:01:43.630> wouldn't<00:01:44.350> line<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.039> hard<00:01:45.700> drive<00:01:46.000> tray<00:01:46.929> or

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
is wouldn't line the hard drive tray or

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.040 
is wouldn't line the hard drive tray or
harddrive<00:01:47.890> rack<00:01:48.159> like<00:01:48.670> right<00:01:49.119> about<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:49.960> and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
harddrive rack like right about here and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.950 
harddrive rack like right about here and
the<00:01:51.039> wires<00:01:51.280> are<00:01:51.520> already<00:01:51.880> there<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.179> that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the wires are already there so that

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.999 
the wires are already there so that
ain't<00:01:53.140> gonna<00:01:53.259> work<00:01:53.350> either<00:01:53.940> also<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:56.800> the

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
ain't gonna work either also one of the

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.990 
ain't gonna work either also one of the
fans<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:58.299> 120<00:01:59.020> millimeter<00:01:59.440> I<00:01:59.770> installed<00:02:00.759> on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
fans the 120 millimeter I installed on

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.600 
fans the 120 millimeter I installed on
this<00:02:01.509> side<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:05.470> fan<00:02:05.709> is<00:02:05.950> installed<00:02:06.520> here

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
this side so the fan is installed here

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.479 
this side so the fan is installed here
on<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.149> top<00:02:07.390> but<00:02:08.350> on<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.619> bottom<00:02:08.799> fan

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
on the top but on the bottom fan

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.970 
on the top but on the bottom fan
I<00:02:09.519> can't<00:02:10.149> install<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.780> here<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.650> had<00:02:11.860> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
I can't install it here so I had to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.699 
I can't install it here so I had to
install<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.180> side<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:14.260> side<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
install it on this side this side of the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.350 
install it on this side this side of the
case<00:02:14.950> actually<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.790> could<00:02:15.910> see<00:02:16.120> when<00:02:16.329> I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
case actually you could see when I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.069 
case actually you could see when I
opened<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.840> or<00:02:17.560> if<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.890> opened<00:02:18.250> up<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.690> front

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
opened that or if I opened up the front

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.420 
opened that or if I opened up the front
panel<00:02:21.359> so<00:02:22.359> that's<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.930> quick<00:02:23.500> show<00:02:23.829> of<00:02:24.130> how

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
panel so that's just a quick show of how

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.780 
panel so that's just a quick show of how
this<00:02:24.670> ar5<00:02:25.180> works

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
this ar5 works

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.670 
this ar5 works
my<00:02:27.790> son<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.390> came<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.930> greeted<00:02:29.230> me<00:02:29.350> happy

give you an idea of how it looks like to
build<00:02:42.519> around<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.030> r54<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.290> dr<00:02:44.620> v<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:46.000> h<00:02:46.780> 100

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
build around the r54 in dr v with h 100

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.310 
build around the r54 in dr v with h 100
cooler<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:48.790> slightly<00:02:49.510> longer<00:02:49.810> than<00:02:49.989> usual

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
cooler a slightly longer than usual

that's pretty long as well and as you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.949 
that's pretty long as well and as you
can<00:02:57.220> see<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> can't<00:02:57.790> even<00:02:57.850> stack<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.600> other

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959

whatever<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.709> want<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.920> call<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.250> because

whatever you want to call it because

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.610 
whatever you want to call it because
it'll<00:03:04.390> hit<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:05.019> here<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.390> pretty<00:03:08.230> much<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
it'll hit right here so pretty much the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.270 
it'll hit right here so pretty much the
only<00:03:08.859> option<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:11.019> unless<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.069> don't

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
only option here is unless I I don't

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.479 
only option here is unless I I don't
mind<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.790> noise<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.359> I<00:03:13.480> do<00:03:13.540> mind<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.959> noise

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
mind the noise and I do mind the noise

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.150 
mind the noise and I do mind the noise
this<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.669> why<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:15.880> bought<00:03:16.479> the<00:03:16.660> r5<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:17.979> it's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
this is why I bought the r5 so that it's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.930 
this is why I bought the r5 so that it's
a<00:03:18.370> pretty<00:03:18.820> silent

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
a pretty silent

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.450 
a pretty silent
other<00:03:20.840> than<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.800> noise<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.280> the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
other than the the noise that the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.910 
other than the the noise that the
harddrive<00:03:23.060> rack<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.780> making<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.530> it's

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
harddrive rack is making it's it's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.690 
harddrive rack is making it's it's
fairly<00:03:25.280> silent<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.360> even<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.930> 100%<00:03:27.710> CPU<00:03:28.100> usage

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
fairly silent so even on 100% CPU usage

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.110 
fairly silent so even on 100% CPU usage
when<00:03:28.880> I'm<00:03:28.970> running<00:03:29.090> handbrake<00:03:29.660> or<00:03:29.870> something

when I'm running handbrake or something

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.880 
when I'm running handbrake or something
so<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.630> pretty<00:03:32.870> much<00:03:33.080> is<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:35.740> thanks<00:03:36.740> for
