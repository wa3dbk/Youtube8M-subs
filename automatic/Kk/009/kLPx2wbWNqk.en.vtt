00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hi everyone, I'm going to make you one today. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.110
 year boxing of a Toshiba laptop is 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.710
 50 particularly the model is the 50 b1 is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.570
 see it to gain an idea if they are to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
 looking for a laptop or simply 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.109
 for curiosity 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.480
 if you are looking to import everything 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.779
 what you need in powder for school or for 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.539
 work wrote several games to have 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.260
 an idea of ​​how this toshiba to 1 50 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 so they have a knowledge and not 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 have doubts 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.210
 before going to the supermarket a big 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 surface 50 are packaged in a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.170
 packaging is the trend china 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 nowadays among the manufacturers 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 and the pain that is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.040
 small size following 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.670
 probably will not need to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.670
 to function 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.390
 here we have the manuals of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.170
 instructions 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 basically banner all with god 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 who is a great team and we just did 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:39.290
 during the trips you take this 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.290
 public learn with tense 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:52.320
 we spend so much is rather thin it is not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 much used to accuse about 2 that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.219
 a little more than two kilos 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.939
 says on toshiba's website he wants to take 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:09.300
 cover the screen and tell us how it is 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:16.250
 that is why these things 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 just who I re-import sugar has 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.230
 Like I said, it's motively fine. 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.010
 here is a sd card reader 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.630
 I do not know if you will read or read but some types 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.970
 I believe it is not only 11 11 only 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:41.070
 the one of sd cards 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:43.440
 so I leave it to a USB port 2.0 of the 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.880
 transformer back 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.210
 we do not have anything I do not know if I would have one 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.110
 lived I believe not because they do not have 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.730
 practically fit to see us 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.730
 begins to be a bit the trend too 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:32.390
 we have a team we have two usb 3.0 ports 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:55.410
 level of connections is very careful with the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:01.310
 help of these new 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.310
 I hope some time later 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:10.739
 I do not work smart and want to work 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.810
 let's press a button and let the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.989
 Senate and press the other 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.870
 simultaneously Brazil who read several 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.280
 video image editing programs or 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.500
 even in games 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.810
 the institution works does not work 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.490
 we need to put both at the same time 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.100
 It is and is not practical to use 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.280
 likely to use one part per 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.280
 This does not matter if the problem 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.190
 nice is just a button 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:05:11.130
 basically this is not 51 and see with 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:14.650
 an intel core i3 and graphics is both a 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:21.160
 amd radeon graphic and that I will not 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:25.180
 Please specify in the box outside 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:31.990
 It's so I do not have any 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:34.419
 indication at the end I will not be able to say 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.110
 which is what I have however is already see 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.400
 so I in terms of functioning and the 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.080
 expectations how it behaves and 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.650
 Irene, I'll talk about it but it's 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.750
 Thank you for seeing it 's good without me. 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.610
 to be in granite a layman did not like 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.210
 so I do not like 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.130
 this garden and thank you the undersigned 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.729
 to be aware of other viruses such as 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.960
 This one
