seal thing was like oh my god so
what<00:01:20.280> had<00:01:20.460> happened<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.890> how<00:01:23.130> like

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
what had happened was you see how like

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
what had happened was you see how like
you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.750> obviously<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you can obviously this thing it has to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
you can obviously this thing it has to
grab<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> crank<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> engine<00:01:27.900> but

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
grab one way to crank the engine but

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.060 
grab one way to crank the engine but
it's<00:01:29.009> got<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> free<00:01:29.460> spin<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it's got a free spin the other way so it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's got a free spin the other way so it
doesn't<00:01:32.100> pull<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> rope<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.140> swing<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.350> rope

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
doesn't pull the rope and swing the rope

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.219 
doesn't pull the rope and swing the rope
everywhere<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> does<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> has

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
everywhere so what it does is it has

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
everywhere so what it does is it has
these<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.500> balls<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
these little balls in here that when you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.889 
these little balls in here that when you
spin<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.220> they're<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.310> fall<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
spin it they're gonna fall out but you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
spin it they're gonna fall out but you
spin<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.409> way<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.960> like

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
spin it this way and they like

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.149 
spin it this way and they like
you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.170> push<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you know they will push up in here and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.990 
you know they will push up in here and
roll<00:01:50.340> over<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> ball<00:01:51.829> it's<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.880> how

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
roll over the ball it's like you see how

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.219 
roll over the ball it's like you see how
it<00:01:54.119> went<00:01:54.270> into<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> slot<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:57.229> that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it went into that slot and then that

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.919 
it went into that slot and then that
slot<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.090> it<00:02:00.090> has<00:02:04.399> one<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.429> three<00:02:05.789> four<00:02:06.299> five

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
slot so it has one two three four five

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.190 
slot so it has one two three four five
six<00:02:07.320> balls<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:10.289> tooth<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.930> little

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
six balls and this tooth this little

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.100 
six balls and this tooth this little
piece<00:02:13.410> right<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:13.680> broke<00:02:14.190> off<00:02:14.630> because<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.930> was

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
piece right here broke off because I was

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.530 
piece right here broke off because I was
using<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.739> tighten<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.360> those

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
using that to tighten it so like those

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.180 
using that to tighten it so like those
balls<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:19.050> pushing<00:02:19.290> against<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.650> aluminum

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
balls are pushing against the aluminum

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.330 
balls are pushing against the aluminum
and<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> cracked<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.709> these<00:02:22.860> two<00:02:23.100> balls

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
and it cracked and so these two balls

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340 
and it cracked and so these two balls
will<00:02:23.760> get<00:02:23.910> jammed<00:02:24.209> up<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:25.019> took<00:02:25.230> them

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
will get jammed up so I just took them

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.650 
will get jammed up so I just took them
out<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.830> think<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.100> will<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.400> enough<00:02:29.660> like

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
out and I think this will be enough like

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.259 
out and I think this will be enough like
enough<00:02:30.959> balls<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.580> grab<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.060> pull<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
enough balls to grab it just to pull a

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.800 
enough balls to grab it just to pull a
thing<00:02:33.540> over<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.880> knees<00:02:36.090> won't<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.540> jammed

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
thing over so the knees won't get jammed

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.140 
thing over so the knees won't get jammed
up<00:02:37.049> with<00:02:37.110> each<00:02:37.410> other<00:02:37.650> oh<00:02:38.090> they're<00:02:39.090> good<00:02:39.650> so

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
up with each other oh they're good so

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.400 
up with each other oh they're good so
I'm<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.269> gonna<00:02:42.390> take<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.170> clean

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410

greased<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.170> should<00:02:49.290> be<00:02:49.410> good<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> go

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

right<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.489> anyone's<00:03:02.850> gonna<00:03:02.970> rebuild<00:03:03.390> one<00:03:03.600> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
right if anyone's gonna rebuild one of

right if anyone's gonna rebuild one of
these<00:03:03.810> don't<00:03:04.170> use<00:03:04.440> grease<00:03:04.799> because<00:03:07.010> make

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
these don't use grease because make

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.720 
these don't use grease because make
sense<00:03:08.370> now<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.069> should<00:03:11.100> not<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.489> used

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
sense now that I should not have used

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.559 
sense now that I should not have used
Greece<00:03:12.950> because<00:03:13.950> Greece<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.280> sticky<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:17.569> when

get<00:03:21.700> pushed<00:03:21.970> up<00:03:22.150> they<00:03:22.360> don't<00:03:22.450> fall<00:03:22.720> back<00:03:22.900> down

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
get pushed up they don't fall back down

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.010 
get pushed up they don't fall back down
and<00:03:23.260> they<00:03:23.350> don't<00:03:23.530> lock<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.480> I'm<00:03:25.570> gonna<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.840> to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
whether or not to repaint it because it

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.490 
whether or not to repaint it because it
had<00:04:14.380> gotten<00:04:14.560> some<00:04:15.010> scratches<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:18.209> but<00:04:19.500> you

know I won't do it for a while if I do

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.390 
know I won't do it for a while if I do
it<00:04:22.900> maybe<00:04:23.140> I'll<00:04:23.620> repaint<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.130> shroud

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400

and one of them was busted and this is a
step-down<00:04:58.360> axle<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.180> was<00:05:01.630> 3/4<00:05:02.169> shafts<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.650> I

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
step-down axle so it was 3/4 shafts so I

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.710 
step-down axle so it was 3/4 shafts so I
had<00:05:02.860> these<00:05:03.010> lawnmower<00:05:03.610> wheels<00:05:03.910> there<00:05:04.630> were

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
had these lawnmower wheels there were

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.690 
had these lawnmower wheels there were
three<00:05:04.930> quarter<00:05:05.260> shaft<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.800> they<00:05:05.890> slid<00:05:06.220> on<00:05:06.400> and

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
three quarter shaft and they slid on and

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.340 
three quarter shaft and they slid on and
brought<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.060> up<00:05:07.120> against<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.810> one<00:05:07.990> inch

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
brought it up against to the one inch

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.250 
brought it up against to the one inch
not<00:05:09.160> just<00:05:09.370> welded<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:12.280> brake<00:05:12.550> works<00:05:13.260> works

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
not just welded it the brake works works

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260 
not just welded it the brake works works
good<00:05:14.560> it's<00:05:14.800> mechanical<00:05:15.370> brake<00:05:15.550> caliper<00:05:16.090> I

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
good it's mechanical brake caliper I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.300 
good it's mechanical brake caliper I
have<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.169> adjusted<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.740> everything<00:05:18.070> works

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
have it adjusted and everything works

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.370 
have it adjusted and everything works
good<00:05:18.610> I'll<00:05:18.880> probably<00:05:19.210> reroute<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.080> maybe<00:05:20.260> a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
good I'll probably reroute it to maybe a

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.570 
good I'll probably reroute it to maybe a
cable<00:05:21.600> because<00:05:22.600> this<00:05:22.780> thing<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.190> my<00:05:24.190> ghetto

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
cable because this thing is my ghetto
