my<00:00:24.510> center<00:00:24.720> console<00:00:25.820> reason<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> picked<00:00:26.970> center

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
my center console reason I picked center

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.310 
my center console reason I picked center
console<00:00:27.630> instead<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> whole<00:00:28.109> dashboard

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
console instead of the whole dashboard

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.839 
console instead of the whole dashboard
was<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:29.519> time<00:00:29.670> I've

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
was because it's the first time I've

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
was because it's the first time I've
ever<00:00:29.880> done<00:00:30.090> anything<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
ever done anything like this

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.959 
ever done anything like this
I've<00:00:31.109> zero<00:00:31.560> experience<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.520> I

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I've zero experience with this and I

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.720 
I've zero experience with this and I
chose<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> least<00:00:34.739> important<00:00:35.309> part<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
chose to do the least important part in

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
chose to do the least important part in
my<00:00:35.850> opinion<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.690> besides<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.170> lower

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
my opinion and besides it's the lower

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
my opinion and besides it's the lower
half<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.309> did<00:00:38.520> screw<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
half so if I did screw up which is you

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.100 
half so if I did screw up which is you
could<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.570> there's<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
could see there's a little bit of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
could see there's a little bit of
bubbling<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> wouldn't

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
bubbling there you know you wouldn't

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.250 
bubbling there you know you wouldn't
notice<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.600> too<00:00:42.690> much<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.079> where

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
notice it too much because that's where

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.650 
notice it too much because that's where
your<00:00:43.350> feet<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.210> practice

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
your feet go so this was good practice

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
your feet go so this was good practice

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
like a whole bunch of it for pretty

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.579 
like a whole bunch of it for pretty
cheap<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> got<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.420> JPM<00:01:04.049> Coachworks

Alcantara<00:01:05.780> shift<00:01:06.780> boot<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.439> cannot

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
Alcantara shift boot and I cannot

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.359 
Alcantara shift boot and I cannot
pronounce<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.250> word<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> life<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> me

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
pronounce that word for the life of me

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
pronounce that word for the life of me
so<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.540> spray

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so pretty much what you do is you spray

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.260 
so pretty much what you do is you spray
the<00:01:13.710> adhesive<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> surface<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the adhesive on the surface you want to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.530 
the adhesive on the surface you want to
put<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> Alcantara<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.490> then<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
put the Alcantara on and then you don't

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.450 
put the Alcantara on and then you don't
want<00:01:18.810> too<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.470> much<00:01:19.590> will<00:01:19.860> soak<00:01:20.220> through

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
want too much too much will soak through

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
want too much too much will soak through
and<00:01:20.820> it'll<00:01:21.119> look<00:01:21.270> like

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and it'll look like

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.830 
and it'll look like
too<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.650> it'll<00:01:22.770> peel<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.840> then

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
too little and it'll peel off and then

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289 
too little and it'll peel off and then
you<00:01:24.960> got<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> cut<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.119> very

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
you got it cut and you have to be very

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.649 
you got it cut and you have to be very
precise<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:29.340> hard<00:01:29.579> man<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
precise and it's hard man you know and I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.810 
precise and it's hard man you know and I
watched<00:01:30.869> shows<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.860> Overhaulin<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.549> pretty

they<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:40.829> easy<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> tough

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
they make it look easy but this is tough

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.929 
they make it look easy but this is tough
um<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.930> came<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.939> tucked

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
um I think came out all right I tucked

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.789 
um I think came out all right I tucked
it<00:01:45.060> under<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.509> didn't<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> top<00:01:46.259> half<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.710> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it under I didn't do the top half like I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.340 
it under I didn't do the top half like I
said<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.369> practice<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.200> did

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
said this is all practice so if I did

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.649 
said this is all practice so if I did
screw<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.829> wouldn't<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.100> catastrophic

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
screw up it wouldn't be catastrophic

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.399 
screw up it wouldn't be catastrophic
because<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:51.869> want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> scrape<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
because I don't want to scrape all that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
because I don't want to scrape all that
glue<00:01:52.890> off<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.280> did<00:01:53.430> screw<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> know

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
glue off if I did screw up you know

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.380 
glue off if I did screw up you know
I'm<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.770> I'm<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> blue<00:01:57.119> on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I'm in and I'm going to put the blue on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
I'm in and I'm going to put the blue on
the<00:01:58.219> like<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.280> guess<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.729> armrest<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the like I guess the armrest of the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.700 
the like I guess the armrest of the
center<00:02:01.229> console<00:02:03.020> turned<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.140> pretty<00:02:04.290> well<00:02:04.380> in

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
center console turned out pretty well in

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.910 
center console turned out pretty well in
my<00:02:05.250> opinion<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.700> mean<00:02:06.200> for<00:02:07.200> my<00:02:07.290> experience<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
my opinion I mean for my experience and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.760 
my opinion I mean for my experience and
like<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.160> said<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> doesn't<00:02:08.520> cost<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.910> lot<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
like I said it doesn't cost a lot the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.199 
like I said it doesn't cost a lot the
fabric<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> spray<00:02:11.520> altogether<00:02:11.970> was

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
fabric and the spray altogether was

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.699 
fabric and the spray altogether was
probably<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.599> 40<00:02:12.900> bucks

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
probably like 40 bucks

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.949 
probably like 40 bucks
and<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:15.090> took<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.329> three<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.629> four<00:02:15.750> hours<00:02:15.930> to

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and it took about three or four hours to

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.140 
and it took about three or four hours to
do<00:02:16.109> all<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:17.310> corners<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.790> toughest

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
do all this the corners are the toughest

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.990 
do all this the corners are the toughest
part<00:02:18.420> cutting<00:02:19.140> always<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:20.519> more<00:02:20.819> fabric

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
part cutting always have more fabric

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.490 
part cutting always have more fabric
than<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.569> think<00:02:21.719> you'll<00:02:21.930> need<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.319> then<00:02:22.439> you

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
than you think you'll need and then you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.170 
than you think you'll need and then you
can<00:02:22.620> always<00:02:22.709> cut<00:02:22.950> later<00:02:23.159> don't<00:02:23.909> cut<00:02:24.150> too

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
can always cut later don't cut too

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.670 
can always cut later don't cut too
little<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.719> when<00:02:24.989> you're<00:02:25.140> glued<00:02:25.439> down

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
little because when you're glued down

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.140 
little because when you're glued down
and<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.219> too<00:02:26.400> little<00:02:26.519> fabric<00:02:26.819> it's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
and you have too little fabric it's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.890 
and you have too little fabric it's
going<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.359> be

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
going to be

like this before I'm happy with the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.470 
like this before I'm happy with the
result<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.409> modified<00:03:05.370> my<00:03:05.400> center<00:03:06.120> console<00:03:06.419> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
result I modified my center console a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.119 
result I modified my center console a
little<00:03:06.659> bit<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.900> took<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.230> center<00:03:07.469> piece<00:03:07.650> out<00:03:07.829> I

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
little bit I took the center piece out I

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.089 
little bit I took the center piece out I
always<00:03:08.969> felt<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.739> armrest<00:03:10.739> was<00:03:11.069> a

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
always felt that the armrest was a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.009 
always felt that the armrest was a
little<00:03:11.400> high<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.030> made<00:03:12.150> me<00:03:12.299> like<00:03:12.450> shrugged

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
little high and it made me like shrugged

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.690 
little high and it made me like shrugged
my<00:03:13.109> shoulders<00:03:13.139> when<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.590> drove<00:03:13.829> so<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.069> just<00:03:14.219> took

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
my shoulders when I drove so I just took

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.890 
my shoulders when I drove so I just took
the<00:03:14.849> center<00:03:15.060> piece<00:03:15.209> out<00:03:15.359> so<00:03:15.389> now<00:03:15.659> it's<00:03:15.780> lower

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the center piece out so now it's lower

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.800 
the center piece out so now it's lower
and<00:03:16.909> here's<00:03:17.909> what<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.150> looks<00:03:18.299> like

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and here's what it looks like

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.619 
and here's what it looks like
oh<00:03:18.949> yeah<00:03:19.949> that's<00:03:20.159> a<00:03:20.220> fire<00:03:20.340> extinguisher<00:03:20.629> can't

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
oh yeah that's a fire extinguisher can't

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.140 
oh yeah that's a fire extinguisher can't
be<00:03:21.720> too<00:03:21.840> safe<00:03:21.989> right<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.799> there<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:23.940> it's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
be too safe right and there it is it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.189 
be too safe right and there it is it's
not<00:03:24.269> bad<00:03:24.590> I'm<00:03:25.590> happy<00:03:25.979> with<00:03:26.069> it<00:03:26.129> a<00:03:27.049> little<00:03:28.049> bit

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
not bad I'm happy with it a little bit

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.490 
not bad I'm happy with it a little bit
of<00:03:28.409> customization<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> interior<00:03:30.500> maybe

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
of customization to the interior maybe

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.589 
of customization to the interior maybe
sometime<00:03:32.189> I'll<00:03:32.340> do<00:03:32.489> part<00:03:32.939> of<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.090> dash<00:03:33.269> but

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
sometime I'll do part of the dash but

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.360 
sometime I'll do part of the dash but
for<00:03:33.780> now<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:34.769> happy<00:03:35.129> with<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:37.159> that's<00:03:38.159> what<00:03:38.310> it

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
for now I'm happy with it that's what it

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.949 
for now I'm happy with it that's what it
looks<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.579> when<00:03:38.729> you<00:03:38.819> put<00:03:38.970> too<00:03:39.090> much<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.449> it's

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959
