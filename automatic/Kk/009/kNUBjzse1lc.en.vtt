00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Well, very good today I bring you a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.980
 very very very different to what video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.839
 we are used to nothing is a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.110
 magic video or manipulation and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.910
 car district is just a video that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.099
 it's not exactly because I've done it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.590
 but there is something inside me that says that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.240
 I have to record it because it's good 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.300
 like a few days now I know germÃ¡n published 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.029
 a video that is called you can be worth the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 video is very interesting content and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.039
 they share many of the ideas that I 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.619
 I have 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.999
 but above all and I think that's why I'm 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.829
 recording this video they share a lot of 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.050
 my experience a lot of what has 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.989
 happened to me in life and good step 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.760
 more or less to tell you the good thing I before 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.050
 As many of you know, I dedicated myself to 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.839
 right to work in an office of 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.120
 lawyers and well now about three 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.059
 four years so I stopped working in 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.519
 that office and I left it and left it for 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.699
 make magic a decision seemingly 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.680
 absurd is apparently madness 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.329
 misunderstood because a lot of people without 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.329
 meaning for almost everyone 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.060
 and good 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.730
 and it's been three years 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.070
 it would be more or three years and I keep doing what 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.280
 I 'm still doing magic, I 'm still doing 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 videos I keep doing what I love and what 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 nice how beautiful is that all 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 this time every step I have taken has 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.790
 been to make my way 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 and that's only why I think it's interesting 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 that you think in what it means to start 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 go your own way every step 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.259
 what you give is your path, not that of another 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.509
 person is not the dream another person is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.030
 yours only yours and I tell you 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.880
 because you know how German says in the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.140
 video you may be doing two 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.030
 things or that you are doing what you love 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.530
 or that you are doing things that you do not love 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.530
 is the two options are possible 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.830
 if you are doing what you love 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.450
 - Obviously you will have fun moments 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.790
 at work difficult moments but 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.260
 good at the end you overcome it and such and if not 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.060
 Well you can change the work does not happen 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.410
 nothing but if you're doing what 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.910
 It is also possible that you have 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.530
 difficult moments and are very 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.710
 complicated because you can get to 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.570
 rethink everything and well I would like 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.010
 also share something when I have 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.460
 such a complicated moment I say to myself 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.780
 same as that test or that difficulty or 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.310
 in that moment when he stopped believing 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.750
 for a moment what I do and what I want 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 leave and this is crazy and nothing has 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.150
 meaning is actually a test a 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.770
 proof that life submits me to see if 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
 I still believe in what I love and good as 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.410
 I said at the beginning nobody said it would be 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.090
 easy 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.440
 take this road but in my case I 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.200
 I say no, I'm not doing anything else 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.209
 because it's what I love and really what 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 what happened after I 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.620
 leave my job and start doing 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.320
 magic and start doing what for 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.780
 many are crazy are things 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.860
 totally spectacular I've met 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.700
 amazing people that inspired me 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.630
 a lot and things that do not have exactly 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.580
 clear how to do at the time of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.840
 at the time of undertaking that trip, 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.840
 they have been very slowly building 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.670
 on the fly if there are times if 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.530
 you want to do something and you're not clear 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.440
 how are you going to make it not to be in 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.030
 how are you going to do it when you really 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.940
 you have a very powerful motive for 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.380
 do it and well I do not really know that is the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.200
 video that I wanted to publish today I have it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.680
 recorded that is a mix but they are now 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.420
 same 3 o'clock in the morning and tomorrow over 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.550
 I have to get up early I wake up like 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.720
 5 hours or yes but I felt that this video 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.350
 I had to record it and I had to 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.550
 post today 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.550
 there will not be a dispose
