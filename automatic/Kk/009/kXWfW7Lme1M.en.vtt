00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
want get myself some source water make

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.240 
want get myself some source water make
myself<00:03:26.700> some<00:03:27.700> machinery<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.480> did<00:03:29.380> think<00:03:30.100> about

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
myself some machinery I did think about

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.790 
myself some machinery I did think about
this<00:03:30.610> for<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.880> long<00:03:30.940> time<00:03:31.290> about<00:03:32.290> whether<00:03:32.710> i

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
this for a long time about whether i

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.700 
this for a long time about whether i
should<00:03:32.920> do<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.340> or<00:03:33.520> not<00:03:33.670> because<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:35.500> was

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
should do this or not because this was

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.320 
should do this or not because this was
obviously<00:03:35.920> unintended<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:37.090> were<00:03:37.180> never

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
obviously unintended you were never

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.830 
obviously unintended you were never
supposed<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.750> put<00:03:37.990> water<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.440> another<00:03:38.590> and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
supposed to put water in another and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.840 
supposed to put water in another and
with<00:03:40.840> things<00:03:41.080> like<00:03:41.290> my<00:03:42.270> blaze<00:03:43.270> farm<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.850> other

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
with things like my blaze farm and other

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.330 
with things like my blaze farm and other
things<00:03:46.410> people<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:47.440> been<00:03:47.650> suggesting<00:03:48.190> i'll

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
things people have been suggesting i'll

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.040 
things people have been suggesting i'll
just<00:03:48.640> put<00:03:48.820> water<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.390> nether<00:03:49.420> put<00:03:49.840> water

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
just put water in the nether put water

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.230 
just put water in the nether put water
another<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.740> like<00:03:50.920> year<00:03:51.370> but<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.210> know

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
another on like year but it's you know

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.660 
another on like year but it's you know
you're<00:03:52.540> not<00:03:52.630> supposed<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:53.290> wasn't<00:03:54.040> intended

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
you're not supposed to wasn't intended

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.720 
you're not supposed to wasn't intended
that's<00:03:54.940> why<00:03:55.120> they<00:03:55.300> broke<00:03:55.860> silk<00:03:56.860> touch<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.610> that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
that's why they broke silk touch so that

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.630 
that's why they broke silk touch so that
people<00:03:58.030> wouldn't<00:03:58.180> put<00:03:58.390> water<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.750> another<00:03:59.640> but

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
people wouldn't put water in another but

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.910 
people wouldn't put water in another but
I<00:04:00.850> decided<00:04:01.390> you<00:04:01.480> know<00:04:01.570> what<00:04:01.720> I'm<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.680> playing

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
I decided you know what I'm in playing

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.470 
I decided you know what I'm in playing
this<00:04:03.040> game<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.310> long<00:04:03.550> time<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:06.150> didn't<00:04:07.150> cheat

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
this game a long time and I didn't cheat

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.320 
this game a long time and I didn't cheat
to<00:04:07.750> do<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.110> as<00:04:08.350> such<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:09.130> was<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.640> creative

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
to do this as such it was just creative

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.970 
to do this as such it was just creative
use<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.630> in-game<00:04:11.410> mechanics<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:12.190> had<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.550> ice

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
use of in-game mechanics I had the ice

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.890 
use of in-game mechanics I had the ice
which<00:04:14.980> was<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.220> very<00:04:15.430> precious<00:04:16.150> resource<00:04:16.660> that

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
which was a very precious resource that

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.490 
which was a very precious resource that
I<00:04:16.960> haven't<00:04:17.169> really<00:04:17.530> used<00:04:17.820> since<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.940> got<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.500> so

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
I haven't really used since I got it so

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.570 
I haven't really used since I got it so
I<00:04:20.530> figured<00:04:20.919> yeah<00:04:21.070> why<00:04:21.430> not

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
I figured yeah why not

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.360 
I figured yeah why not
the<00:04:23.580> option<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.000> there<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.919> anything<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.040> make

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
the option is there and anything I make

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.960 
the option is there and anything I make
in<00:04:26.580> another<00:04:26.910> if<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.660> do<00:04:27.720> use<00:04:28.199> water<00:04:28.530> I'll<00:04:29.010> try

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
in another if I do use water I'll try

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.360 
in another if I do use water I'll try
and<00:04:30.180> come<00:04:30.389> up<00:04:30.419> with<00:04:30.720> versions<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:31.979> don't

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
and come up with versions that don't

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.350 
and come up with versions that don't
require<00:04:32.610> water<00:04:33.440> for<00:04:34.440> people<00:04:34.770> oh<00:04:35.990> dear<00:04:38.360> hasn't

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
require water for people oh dear hasn't

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.820 
require water for people oh dear hasn't
worked<00:04:39.660> all<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.889> way<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.370> corner<00:04:41.639> here

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
worked all the way to the corner here

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:52.580 
worked all the way to the corner here
gonna<00:04:43.830> have<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:44.010> fix<00:04:44.310> this<00:04:48.229> huh<00:04:51.590> that's

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
gonna have to fix this huh that's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.550 
gonna have to fix this huh that's
strange

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.300 

I'm<00:05:01.310> have<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.700> take<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.910> look<00:05:02.150> at<00:05:02.270> that<00:05:02.889> but<00:05:03.889> yeah

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
I'm have to take a look at that but yeah

I'm have to take a look at that but yeah
so<00:05:04.610> I<00:05:04.639> will<00:05:05.030> try<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.360> make<00:05:05.660> versions<00:05:06.260> that

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
so I will try and make versions that

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.250 
so I will try and make versions that
don't<00:05:06.680> need<00:05:06.919> war<00:05:07.540> for<00:05:08.540> anything<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.930> come<00:05:09.139> up
