well<00:04:01.390> for<00:04:01.630> smaller<00:04:02.200> babies<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.100> once<00:04:03.370> they're

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
well for smaller babies so once they're

and they're able to hang on to the
breasts<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.630> little<00:04:07.720> bit<00:04:07.960> better<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:09.250> can<00:04:09.490> set

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
breasts a little bit better you can set

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.420
