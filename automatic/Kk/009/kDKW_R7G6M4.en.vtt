00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 but video clicked that yes we are 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.420
 arrived at the second episode at 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.860
 it comes with every weapon 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.530
 to get flock and without 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.410
 complete her so completely naked and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.080
 this time the pgw 750 is a very nice one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.960
 strong weapon with the mp 7 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 equated when it comes to yes 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.769
 how early you switch off, namely 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.560
 at level and exhaust 4 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.400
 as soon as you graduate liter 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 you can unlock this weapon 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.399
 also equip 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.489
 yes what should I say to this weapon 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.770
 So I'll tell you so I'll go to the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.280
 match tells me you okay people i need 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 now pdw 750 gameplay swarm without 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.239
 completion series 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.129
 let's see what's coming out ok go express was 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 I like the map so it was 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.820
 not so i do not like to follow at all 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 central point so yes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.809
 because I go in there from the ptb is synonymous 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 still sick so level 9 and i think so 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.600
 I've just finished with it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 you already have prestige unlocked 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.510
 So goes in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.369
 five minutes later off to the tree 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.049
 I once had the mpc I did not participate 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.450
 I had a bit longer picture 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.430
 for used but pdw 740 so far 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 this weapon is really strong very simple 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 to use little recoil high magazine 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.820
 capacity magazine and damage I have 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.659
 also said yes recoil is very low 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 So boring horny I like it on the radio 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.540
 How much is not so bad 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.549
 I'll show it here again 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 I for a class uses the same 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.170
 as I used it with the mp 7 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.320
 but only this time that are a www 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 Use 50 points and he has the grip 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.840
 is not so necessary anymore and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 You do not need to grow fast either 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 because 50 rounds blah blah blah and now 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 seems I have also just 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.530
 you do not need to find out 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.310
 because there is a flash so a mistake 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.189
 in the game 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 that means that if you with the pds 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.079
 pdw 750 with a silencer on it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 still shoots on the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.700
 minimap and here's one too 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.829
 situation i see the guy there above 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.119
 Effect one must as the player the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.619
 assess situation when it comes to 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.789
 example lurking around the corner and the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.450
 I saw yes did not move 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.430
 on the radar 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.200
 then you can be pretty good at it 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.200
 go out that mister fought and to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.150
 for 50 beautiful points you can 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.560
 assume that he fights and that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
 one should rather piss off because 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 either want to give it a flock 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.870
 for which one has fought or is running 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.340
 just go away and take care of one 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.349
 other position on the way I like it 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.840
 did and I have a few 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.349
 or a new guy with his sime 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.140
 killed 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.200
 he probably for pocket money 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.630
 purchased by his mother has so well 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.120
 It is going to be great and I believe it 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
 we have so a bit a40 in forever 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 in front of the black always a bit 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.709
 shit i try so soon once 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.269
 still goes for the brand and yes me 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.500
 I think going after even shot down 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.239
 but I still show some teams 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.599
 form afterwards a very good graduation 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.549
 honor 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.069
 but you must but be careful that 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.200
 Do not get into your own form of things 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.180
 so fly into your own form hunter 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.980
 killers so for everyone who is spongy 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.440
 Knowledge is just 10,000 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.269
 crafts in the office in the air in the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.799
 even up the states 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.870
 enemy drones what legal I am 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.150
 I even think helicopters and man 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.440
 Also their pbs and 40 ah yes to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.849
 Everything is possible in the air 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.910
 is that weapons like dogs 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.829
 shot in the air and kill 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.819
