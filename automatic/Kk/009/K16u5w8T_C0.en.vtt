00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
only one season here it felt a little

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.660

boring then Mike Darnell from Fox came
up<00:00:46.879> with<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.089> idea<00:00:47.149> of<00:00:47.390> putting<00:00:47.629> a<00:00:47.809> form<00:00:48.049> of

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
up with the idea of putting a form of

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
loved it this is a way to change the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.319 
loved it this is a way to change the
poor<00:00:54.409> man<00:00:54.619> entirely<00:00:54.979> by<00:00:55.339> saying<00:00:55.640> instead<00:00:56.119> of

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
poor man entirely by saying instead of

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.599 
poor man entirely by saying instead of
picking<00:00:56.510> their<00:00:56.809> dance<00:00:57.079> genre<00:00:57.979> out<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.399> hat

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
picking their dance genre out of a hat

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.729 
picking their dance genre out of a hat
we'll<00:00:59.149> pick<00:00:59.329> a<00:00:59.359> photograph<00:00:59.960> of<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.260> dancer<00:01:00.649> out

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
we'll pick a photograph of a dancer out

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.249 
we'll pick a photograph of a dancer out
of<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.920> hat<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:01.369> will<00:01:01.460> dictate<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.780> genre

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 
of a hat and that will dictate the genre

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.049 
of a hat and that will dictate the genre
so<00:01:03.649> if<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:03.890> picked<00:01:04.189> which<00:01:04.489> out<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.909> hat<00:01:05.030> you

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
so if you picked which out of a hat you

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.470 
so if you picked which out of a hat you
know<00:01:05.420> you're<00:01:05.689> not<00:01:05.869> doing<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.289> Viennese<00:01:06.679> Waltz
