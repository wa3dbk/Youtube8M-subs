00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.949 
boost energy and most of the time I
would<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.280> sip<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.450> throughout<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.930> day

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
would just sip on it throughout the day

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:12.770 
would just sip on it throughout the day
and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.770 
and
I'll<00:02:12.870> probably<00:02:13.200> drink<00:02:13.560> maybe<00:02:13.740> half<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.310> it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
I'll probably drink maybe half of it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.210 
I'll probably drink maybe half of it
each<00:02:15.780> day<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.440> know<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> lot<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.860> times<00:02:17.070> I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
each day you know a lot of times I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.620 
each day you know a lot of times I
wouldn't<00:02:17.520> even<00:02:17.580> need<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.880> full<00:02:18.180> one

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
wouldn't even need a full one

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.460 
wouldn't even need a full one
so<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.490> Kirkland<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.090> definitely<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.900> pretty

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so the Kirkland one definitely is pretty

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.170 
so the Kirkland one definitely is pretty
good<00:02:22.740> if<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.920> know<00:02:23.130> anything<00:02:23.430> about<00:02:23.490> Costco

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
good if you know anything about Costco

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.590 
good if you know anything about Costco
and<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> Kirkland<00:02:24.960> brand<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.360> stuff

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and the Kirkland brand all of that stuff

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
and the Kirkland brand all of that stuff
is<00:02:27.720> high-quality<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.620> lot<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.950> people<00:02:29.190> may<00:02:29.400> not

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
is high-quality a lot of people may not

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.760 
is high-quality a lot of people may not
know<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.590> everything<00:02:31.590> from

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
know that but on everything from

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.030 
know that but on everything from
Kirkland<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.840> Costco's<00:02:33.840> brand<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.709> state

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
Kirkland is Costco's brand but is state

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.860 
Kirkland is Costco's brand but is state
they<00:02:35.220> put<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> lot<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.790> effort<00:02:36.150> energy<00:02:36.330> into

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
they put a lot of effort energy into

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.990 
they put a lot of effort energy into
their<00:02:37.020> stuff<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.560> they're<00:02:38.310> not<00:02:38.490> like<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> lot<00:02:38.970> of

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
their stuff so they're not like a lot of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.030 
their stuff so they're not like a lot of
other<00:02:39.270> store<00:02:39.600> brands<00:02:39.959> they're<00:02:40.230> real<00:02:40.470> quality

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
other store brands they're real quality

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.280 
other store brands they're real quality
stuff<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.880> energy<00:02:42.090> shot<00:02:42.630> from<00:02:42.870> Kirkland

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
stuff and this energy shot from Kirkland

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
stuff and this energy shot from Kirkland
is<00:02:43.410> pretty<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.100> would<00:02:44.550> say<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:45.330> on<00:02:45.510> par

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
is pretty good I would say it's on par

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.880 
is pretty good I would say it's on par
with<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.980> 5-hour<00:02:47.459> energy<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.709> wrap

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
with the 5-hour energy but just to wrap

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.560 
with the 5-hour energy but just to wrap
this<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.220> not<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.520> take<00:02:50.730> too<00:02:50.760> long<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.390> for

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
this up not to take too long but for

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.110 
this up not to take too long but for
people<00:02:51.690> who<00:02:51.870> don't<00:02:52.050> know<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:53.220> 5-hour<00:02:53.640> energy

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
people who don't know this 5-hour energy

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.680 
people who don't know this 5-hour energy
stuff<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.540> pretty<00:02:54.840> good<00:02:55.110> I've<00:02:55.410> only<00:02:55.950> used<00:02:56.690> this

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
stuff is pretty good I've only used this

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.510 
stuff is pretty good I've only used this
you<00:02:58.050> know<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> 5-hour<00:02:58.680> energy<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.489> I

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
you know the 5-hour energy and now I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.699 
you know the 5-hour energy and now I
tried<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> Kirkland<00:03:00.510> I've<00:03:00.900> never<00:03:01.170> tried<00:03:01.440> any

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
tried the Kirkland I've never tried any

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.949 
tried the Kirkland I've never tried any
of<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.950> other<00:03:02.160> brands<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.850> really<00:03:03.510> never<00:03:03.720> had

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
of the other brands I really never had

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.560 
of the other brands I really never had
any<00:03:04.170> interest<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> don't<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.300> how

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
any interest in it so I don't know how

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.479 
any interest in it so I don't know how
safe<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.230> effective<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.830> other<00:03:08.040> ones<00:03:08.280> are

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
safe and effective the other ones are

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.150 
safe and effective the other ones are
but<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.120> did<00:03:09.450> research<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.170> 5-hour<00:03:10.620> energy

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
but I did research the 5-hour energy

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.979 
but I did research the 5-hour energy
years<00:03:11.400> ago<00:03:11.670> when<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.880> first<00:03:11.910> started<00:03:12.510> using<00:03:12.690> it

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
years ago when I first started using it

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.350 
years ago when I first started using it
and<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.920> all<00:03:14.100> good<00:03:14.340> ingredients<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.120> there

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
and it's all good ingredients in there

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.539 
and it's all good ingredients in there
as<00:03:15.510> safe<00:03:16.230> as<00:03:16.440> long<00:03:16.470> as<00:03:16.680> you're<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:16.920> abusing<00:03:17.310> it

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
as safe as long as you're not abusing it

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.479 
as safe as long as you're not abusing it
now<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.620> you're<00:03:19.620> working<00:03:19.890> out<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.430> you're

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
now if you're working out and you're

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.880 
now if you're working out and you're
into<00:03:20.880> pre-workout<00:03:21.660> supplements<00:03:22.500> the

stronger<00:03:25.890> than<00:03:26.610> despite<00:03:27.299> our<00:03:27.510> energy<00:03:27.959> shots

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
stronger than despite our energy shots

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.430 
stronger than despite our energy shots
so<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.880> keep<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.510> mind<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.049> you
