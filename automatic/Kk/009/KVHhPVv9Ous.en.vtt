00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.960
 a cookie cake with banana and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.270
 milk 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.210
 which is very fast and very easy to do and 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.130
 for a birthday is ideal 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.610
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.910
 for the cake 1 or 2 ripe bananas 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.700

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.329
 of dulce de leche 200 grams of cheese 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.849
 cream 18 square cookies I used the 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.790
 that you see in the image a half glass of 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.910
 vanilla milk or liqueur to give it flavor 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.399
 to the milk that is optional for the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.629
 coverage we're going to need 200 grams 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.600
 of dark chocolate 55 grams of cream 12 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.519
 grams of unsalted butter and noodles 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.060
 of chocolate cookies or anything 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.130
 that we want to use to decorate 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.830
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.590
 Mix the cream cheese with the sweet 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.270
 milk and keep it cold so that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.270
 take a little bit of consistency 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.270
 Now we peel and slice the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.270
 bananas 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.090
 Now it's time to mix the milk 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.600
 with vanilla or with liquor if 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.400
 we want to do 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.550
 and we have fun milk on a plate 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.650
 we are bathing each cookie in the milk and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.630
 we place them on our tray to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.630
 form a base with 6 cookies 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.780
 based on cookies we place a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.780
 capita de bantanos 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310
 over bananas we put a layer 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:48.680
 generous of dulce de leche cream and the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:50.900
 We extend carefully we return to 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.689
 place another layer of 6 cookies on top 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.389
 sweet milk and we repeat all the 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:00.700
 previous operation placing the banana 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.700
 and then more dulce de leche cream 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.879
 we finished the cake with one last layer 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.879
 of cookies smeared in milk 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.500
 we clean with a spatula what we 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.600
 It has come around the edges and we keep it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.940
 in the fridge while we prepare the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.640
 cover we put a saucepan on fire very 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.090
 shortly and we add the chocolate and the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.090
 Butter 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:02.560
 we remove the two things together until 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:04.900
 are well fused last we add 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.470
 the cream and we integrate it well with the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.470
 chocolate 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:21.610
 and now we throw the chocolate over 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.590
 of our cookie layer and the 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.410
 extend with the help of a spatula 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.320
 and the edges come and we take it to 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.180
 cold to solidify 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.610
 if we want to place cookies or 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.220
 some decoration that feels stick 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.110
 to the cake we will have to put it before 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:05:15.600
 that the chocolate gets cold because if 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:05:17.280
 not only indicated it is no longer prepared and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.080
 now we only have to decorate it 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.300
 our pleasure to take it to the fridge 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.340
 minimum a couple of hours and enjoy it 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.159
 and now a brief summary of the steps 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.830
 that we have followed first we mix the 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.139
 cheese with the dulce de leche after 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.199
 peel and cut the banana into slices 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.379
 and we mix the milk with the essence or the 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.419
 liquor and pour it in a bargain 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.419
 every cookie in the milk we said a 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.250
 base with 6 cookies on the cookies 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.120
 we put slices of banana and the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.690
 we cover with the cream of milk 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.190
 we form another layer with cookies 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.320
 we repeat the operation and we put another 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.360
 layer of pleasure there is no cream 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.250
 we finished with a layer of cookies 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.949
 we mix the chocolate with the 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.680

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.939
