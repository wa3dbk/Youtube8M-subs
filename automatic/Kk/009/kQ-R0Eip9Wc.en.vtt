 d'antonio for all children welcome 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.920
 in this video 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.840
 I'm hammers 13 and even today I 'm 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.500
 here to bring you another map of the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.050
 dlc vengeance package released by call 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.670
 of duty black ops July 22 on consoles 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.250
 xbox 360 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.559
 well from the other videos we have already seen 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.540
 two other maps of this ask for two 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.519
 cool and tour multiplayer maps 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.900
 if you want to see them you have n't seen them yet 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.309
 or you want to see how they are made 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.260
 you will find the links in description or 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.110
 just search for our channel in 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.080
 latest videos and you will find them then today 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.740
 we are here on the rush map rush map 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.280
 which is easily recognizable even from the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.229
 trailer because the map where it comes from 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.490
 played in the paintball fields in fact 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.560
 from how you can see also in the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.960
 images is easily recognizable 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 also this paintball thing why 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.950
 each map object any 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.980
 object is covered with passing paint 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 to size analysis and more 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.490
 I tell you right away that as a map it is a 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.440
 macchia is a very small map indeed 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.980
 in this map 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.380
 obviously there will be 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.290
 definitely the most rushed 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.780
 not people who play a lot 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.270
 tactics there will be a movement is a fire 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.580
 continuous from all sides because how 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.060
 also says the name maps from the dark rush 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.890
 machine guns and gogò casinos and I said 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.940
 which I was saying I have n't forgotten 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.520
 oh yes rush said the small map though 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.310
 in spite of everything 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.680
 we have a lot of obstacles and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.080
 a mountain of obstacles and also for this 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 that I tell you that favors the game of 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.440
 rush since there are not too many obstacles 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.410
 low where one hides gets up and 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.830
 ie see for example if we go to 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.720
 see how you have already seen even where 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.330
 there is the flag behind domain 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.040
 there are practically obstacles 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.460
 high in seems there is a bus and a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.500
 container where practically one can 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.060
 hide behind and therefore that is 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.510
 you will not be able to hit in any way a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.550
 part with c4 grenades and things like that 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.230
 therefore one must be continuous 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.190
 movement on this monk because 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.260
 being really small is in this 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.840
 package besides which I think this 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.520
 is even smaller than kobe ​​and therefore 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.890
 I've already told you 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.300
 extreme rush to second class according to 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.590
 me, of course, are the machine guns 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.800
 machine guns like pdv and n smc maybe with 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.920
 quick charger and if you have so much 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:25.130
 precision, for example, I don't use it e 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.870
 you want to have more reach more fire 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.940
 instant a nice rapid fire 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.920
 obviously all these tips are 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.140
 personal opinions after having played 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.739
 those two three times just come out the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.239
 dlc then guys is between trams and buses there 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.250
 it could have been so it's not much 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.930
 different though I said they are panels 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.150
 characters e 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.819
 what other series of killings there 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.829
 advice series of killings like dogs 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.329
 lightning attack and shift machinery of 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.989
 this is because as you see in this area 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.599
 of the map is closed and as this 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.370
 area is closed and where it also focuses 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.549
 more enemy fire 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.799
 so if you use series of 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.950
 swarm-type killers or something 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.599
 stealth easy assault drones 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.269
 they will easily go by 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.070
 lock up in this place and therefore can 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.349
 therefore they will not kill 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.850
 I recommend type series like the 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.640
 small car large xd 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.470
 or dogs because they are you can command them 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.780
 they can easily enter these 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.760
 houses are provided to you that your opponents 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.880
 they also tend to leave half map 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.410
 that is concerned also to put a 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.120
 beautiful lightning attack 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.950
 so guys tell me what you think of 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.680
 this map tell me what you think of 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.880
 this video I leave you left a 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.450
 nice i like it and see you at the next one 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.450
 video
