00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
but that's a problem that most mega man

but that's a problem that most mega man
5<00:00:48.210> weapons<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.899> maple<00:00:49.530> mama<00:00:49.980> ha<00:00:50.100> arrived<00:00:50.430> as

5 weapons have maple mama ha arrived as
not<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.719> usually<00:00:51.960> deals<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.800> normal<00:00:53.430> lines<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
not it usually deals to normal lines of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
not it usually deals to normal lines of
posture<00:00:54.239> damage<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.550> there's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> surprising

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
posture damage but there's a surprising

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
posture damage but there's a surprising
amount<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.629> enemies<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.829> weak<00:00:59.309> against

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
amount of enemies that is weak against

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.500 
amount of enemies that is weak against
it<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.780> clearly<00:01:01.770> shown<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.489> those<00:01:03.059> guys<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it is clearly shown here those guys it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
it is clearly shown here those guys it
would<00:01:03.629> normally<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.650> require<00:01:05.100> three

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
would normally I think require three

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
would normally I think require three
Buster<00:01:05.850> shots<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> each<00:01:06.390> part<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> those

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
Buster shots on each part so those

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.039 
Buster shots on each part so those
falling<00:01:08.970> crystals<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> pipes<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
falling crystals here I pipes of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140 
falling crystals here I pipes of
bullshit<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:11.189> come<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> random

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
bullshit because they come out in random

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.899 
bullshit because they come out in random
intervals<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> why<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.430> try<00:01:14.729> out

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
intervals so why don't we try out

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
intervals so why don't we try out
something<00:01:15.240> we've<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.869> picked<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.220> su

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
something we've just picked up the su

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.350 
something we've just picked up the su
perro<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> movement<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.490> makes

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
perro this is a movement to which makes

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530 
perro this is a movement to which makes
rush<00:01:22.020> jet<00:01:22.320> almost<00:01:22.740> completely<00:01:23.400> obsolete<00:01:23.610> if

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
rush jet almost completely obsolete if

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
rush jet almost completely obsolete if
it<00:01:24.810> didn't<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.350> much<00:01:25.770> energy<00:01:26.070> buddies

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it didn't take so much energy buddies

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.510 
it didn't take so much energy buddies
you're<00:01:27.479> usually<00:01:27.659> looking<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.159> maybe

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you're usually looking at two one maybe

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.499 
you're usually looking at two one maybe
two<00:01:30.020> activations<00:01:31.020> per<00:01:31.560> level<00:01:31.829> which<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> ok<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
two activations per level which is ok I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
two activations per level which is ok I
guess<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.590> also<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:35.009> those<00:01:35.189> platforms

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
guess you can also make those platforms

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
guess you can also make those platforms
which<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.240> eat<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.750> weapon<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> like

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
often because it's more of a speedrun

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600 
often because it's more of a speedrun
children<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.829> how<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> survived<00:01:44.340> that

against<00:01:46.500> those<00:01:46.649> crystals<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:48.390> hate

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
against those crystals I really hate

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.230 
against those crystals I really hate
those<00:01:48.780> things<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.430> might<00:01:50.700> get

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
those things because you might get

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
those things because you might get
through<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.259> jump<00:01:52.829> when<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
through if you just jump when one is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.550 
through if you just jump when one is
falling<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.229> should<00:01:55.530> be

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
falling down I think it should be

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.750 
falling down I think it should be
possible<00:01:56.570> but<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.780> am<00:01:57.899> real

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
possible but I am real

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.030 
possible but I am real

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
bad at the stunning classes and if you

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.620 
bad at the stunning classes and if you
wait<00:02:01.370> for<00:02:01.700> them<00:02:01.880> instead<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.420> using

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
wait for them instead of using

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
but I'm not going to talk about it

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.570 
but I'm not going to talk about it
because<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.530> want<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.830> talk<00:03:04.040> about<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.400> mice

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
because I want to talk about the mice

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.449 
because I want to talk about the mice
and<00:03:04.820> I'll<00:03:04.910> show<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.209> off<00:03:05.330> later<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.870> ending<00:03:06.230> is

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
and I'll show it off later the ending is

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.590 
and I'll show it off later the ending is
what<00:03:07.459> if<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.670> could<00:03:07.820> be<00:03:07.940> perfect<00:03:08.330> against<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
what if I could be perfect against the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600 
what if I could be perfect against the
ground-based<00:03:09.050> enemy<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:09.650> right<00:03:10.190> yeah

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
ground-based enemy right right yeah

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.790 
ground-based enemy right right yeah
that's<00:03:11.060> probably<00:03:11.450> why<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.840> takes<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.590> both

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
that's probably why it takes to both

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.240 
that's probably why it takes to both
ways<00:03:13.070> against<00:03:13.489> those<00:03:13.610> guys<00:03:13.930> or<00:03:14.930> three<00:03:15.890> against

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
ways against those guys or three against

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.150 
ways against those guys or three against
this<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:17.209> just<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.750> more<00:03:18.380> enemies<00:03:18.950> were

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
this one it's just if more enemies were

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400 
this one it's just if more enemies were
a<00:03:19.190> week<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.510> would<00:03:20.690> actually<00:03:20.930> not

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
a week to it then it would actually not

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.850 
a week to it then it would actually not
be<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.830> bad<00:03:22.220> but<00:03:23.120> as<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.630> deals<00:03:23.810> no<00:03:24.230> damage<00:03:24.680> at

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
be that bad but as it deals no damage at

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.810 
be that bad but as it deals no damage at
all<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:25.730> starfish<00:03:26.300> does<00:03:26.600> well<00:03:27.820> here

absolutely apparent here because those

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.770 
absolutely apparent here because those
crystals<00:04:39.940> are<00:04:40.590> absolutely<00:04:41.590> hard<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.980> dodge

those kinds of attacks the other tech
that<00:04:53.470> he<00:04:53.620> has<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.980> really<00:04:54.340> easy<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.820> dodge<00:04:55.000> on

that he has is really easy to dodge on

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.200 
that he has is really easy to dodge on
the<00:04:55.300> other<00:04:55.570> hand<00:04:56.760> especially<00:04:57.760> when<00:04:57.880> he's<00:04:58.030> nice

the other hand especially when he's nice
and<00:04:58.240> only<00:04:58.630> doing<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.080> when<00:04:59.740> coupled<00:05:00.580> with<00:05:00.820> the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
and only doing it when coupled with the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.630 
and only doing it when coupled with the
crystals<00:05:01.660> flying<00:05:01.960> around<00:05:02.230> it's<00:05:02.500> really<00:05:03.460> hard

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
crystals flying around it's really hard

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
that I'm really really bad at it

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.500 
that I'm really really bad at it
actually<00:05:09.160> shooting<00:05:09.400> him<00:05:09.640> because<00:05:09.970> panicking

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
actually shooting him because panicking

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
against crystal mine is so common
