 melgar castillo goes for the ball 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 ball for martínez delaying here the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.510
 shot opportunity and the goal of the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.510
 ticos 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 with tension that feels freer with 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.400
 Thursday in the midfield is the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 projection that has given her farías from 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.870
 that came to the field that feels very 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.789
 comfortable when 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.100
 in front to swipe the sweep strong 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.199

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
 well now in a brave game has 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.559
 to start working was wrong in 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.780
 the pellerano exit the ball that comes out 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.390
 bounced ruiz can not stay but the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.790
 spherical still red steals it colom 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.500
 but this is what we decided colom 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.879
 suddenly it needs to put more force 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.129
 caring tends to martínez and even so 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.440
 reaches from left to center, which does not 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.300
 arrives from pellerano cristian 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.300
 he stole the ball and then the skin 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.220
 in the red kevin forgive me because here 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.380
 has the ball justice 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.180
 contrite is that those ties are what 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.050
 they cost him parties of the town 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.290
 alústiza by are delivered 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.510
 after the third string there is no 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.070
 missing of course he surrendered 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.870
 fidel martínez against the brand of 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.400
 michael orozco delivers by means of 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.860
 a lonely fernando ass who does not 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.620
 good control of the ball 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.720
 recover the chance ado perfect neat 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.850
 accurate in such a difficult task as the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.080
 to be the auxiliary and appreciate those 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.640
 plays here there is no place 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.140
 Hercules Hercules Hercules I leave it 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.140
 hold the shot 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.430
 calculator to Mars 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.430
 this one of ortiz 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.859
 Y 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.240
 with commit affective block that in the 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.270
 Spherical error in the match is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.969
 wrong again exploits a man of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 24 years that has been a scorer even in 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.360
 the good South American Cup opens in 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.390
 mexican soccer thirty three 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 annotations add the 34 in your 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.209
 career 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.099
 emilio I hear you lost very ugly the 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.739
 marca and hernán darío pellerano there are 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.750
 say it in the center is the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.780
 ball gives you a lot of circulation is that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.849
 Juan now gets Oliver Ortiz who has 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.069
 had it seems to me a pretty match 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.680
 well this depends central now 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.280
 retrieves the ball like this novel with another 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.560
 the squalor and golear blue cross 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.239
 pachuca with a lot of game volume with 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.990
 many arrivals but playing really 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.160
 well on offense 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.160
 by Roman 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 of balance 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.840
 I think they did the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.250
 postiza da 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.250
 Well, people stop 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.920
 that is to say 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920
 well, it can not be left between 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.660
 although they have good is moving is what 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.360
 reason 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.400
 the ball recovered again by xolos 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.490
 of tijuana attention with this can be 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.830
 the try for time is in the 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.430
 coverage as it should be 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.280
 there is appearing, it must appear a lot 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.860
 more he is an important engine that has 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.560
 to be much more proactive here 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.990
 he does it right it's sanchez and he goes biting 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.140
 Luis Miguel Noriega the center and the crossing 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.880
 in charge of something colo was important and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.930
 simply in the background bursts the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.390
 cirilo goalkeeper are a hundred 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.629
 saga that is handled wonderfully with the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.819
 army and does not hurt anything though 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.769
 that he started a little bit right on the 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.490
 beginning enrique perez began to 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.410
 adapt is accommodated and nothing hurts 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.410
 the waist and from the pantry to the 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.740
 red and black said the other 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.000
 has white with the service open 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.000
 güemes in the header 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.690
 but not from the magnetic fields means 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.000
 more dynamic young people faster 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.470
 younger where they need many times 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.430
 good pension ball is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.430
 richard ruiz of the car 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.980
 and now they are raped and now you want 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.509
 of game 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:55.819
 devastating the rival begins already to mark 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.649
 in the game and starts to see more 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.019
 worried already Ruben omar Roman and the 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:03.849
