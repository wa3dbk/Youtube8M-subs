00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
straightforward build there's lots of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.580

big scenes with these two these two
whole<00:01:25.590> halves<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:28.130> also<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.829> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
whole halves here and also where the the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
whole halves here and also where the the
cells<00:01:32.130> come<00:01:32.820> together<00:01:32.939> along<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
cells come together along here on the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.030 
cells come together along here on the
front<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.409> back<00:01:34.650> pretty<00:01:35.490> good<00:01:35.670> seams<00:01:35.970> there

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
front and back pretty good seams there

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.200 
front and back pretty good seams there
nothing<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> puddi<00:01:38.400> didn't<00:01:38.729> take<00:01:38.880> care<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
nothing that puddi didn't take care of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.050 
nothing that puddi didn't take care of
so<00:01:42.210> yeah<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:45.920> like<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> colors<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.640> decals

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so yeah I like the colors of the decals

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.600 
so yeah I like the colors of the decals
they<00:01:48.240> stand<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.689> pretty<00:01:48.899> well<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:50.369> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
they stand out pretty well I think this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090 
they stand out pretty well I think this
one<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.320> accurate<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
one right here is not accurate to the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
one right here is not accurate to the
studio<00:01:53.549> model<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> way<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
studio model but I like the way that it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.090 
studio model but I like the way that it
looks<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> went<00:01:56.100> ahead<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> put<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
looks so I went ahead and put it on

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.620 
looks so I went ahead and put it on
which<00:01:59.100> leaves<00:01:59.399> me<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.149> big<00:02:00.360> gripe

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
which leaves me to the one big gripe

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 
which leaves me to the one big gripe
that<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.770> kit<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.000> is

supposed to look so I just kind of

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.940 
supposed to look so I just kind of
winged<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:49.129> also<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.250> numbers<00:02:50.549> are<00:02:50.700> wrong

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
this number 8 decal here is this little

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.819 
this number 8 decal here is this little
decal<00:02:57.660> here<00:02:57.930> where<00:02:58.109> there's<00:02:58.290> only<00:02:58.410> four<00:02:58.799> of

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
decal here where there's only four of

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.280 
decal here where there's only four of
those<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.519> kit<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:00.989> off

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
those in the kit but if you go on off

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.180 
those in the kit but if you go on off
the<00:03:01.470> instructions<00:03:02.180> there's<00:03:03.180> two<00:03:04.190> there's

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
the instructions there's two there's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.430 
the instructions there's two there's
four<00:03:05.940> there's<00:03:06.480> five<00:03:06.989> there's<00:03:07.709> seven<00:03:08.400> and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
four there's five there's seven and

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.539 
four there's five there's seven and
there's<00:03:10.440> an<00:03:10.650> eighth<00:03:10.859> one<00:03:11.129> well<00:03:11.310> there's<00:03:11.430> only

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
there's an eighth one well there's only

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.190 
there's an eighth one well there's only
four<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.150> kit<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.160> I'm<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.690> sure<00:03:15.690> what

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
four in a kit so I'm not sure what

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.520 
four in a kit so I'm not sure what
that's<00:03:16.650> all<00:03:16.950> about

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
that's all about

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.009 
that's all about
so<00:03:19.639> that<00:03:20.639> needs<00:03:20.849> some<00:03:21.060> work<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.930> know

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
so that needs some work I think I know

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.300 
so that needs some work I think I know
you<00:03:22.620> know<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:23.459> supposed<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:24.060> slightly

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
you know it's supposed to be slightly

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.830 
you know it's supposed to be slightly
slightly<00:03:26.310> better<00:03:26.639> than<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.940> original<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
slightly better than the original that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.190 
slightly better than the original that
came<00:03:28.019> out<00:03:28.169> back<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.560> 60s<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
came out back in the 60s but that I you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.569 
came out back in the 60s but that I you
know<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.349> understand<00:03:31.829> trying<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.160> keep<00:03:32.310> costs

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
know I understand trying to keep costs

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.009 
know I understand trying to keep costs
under<00:03:32.819> control<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.959> just

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
under control and all that but I just

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.210 
under control and all that but I just
think<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.440> could<00:03:34.650> have<00:03:34.739> been<00:03:34.859> done<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> little

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
think that could have been done a little

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.089 
think that could have been done a little
bit<00:03:35.430> better<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.989> antennas<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.739> front<00:03:37.980> are

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
bit better the antennas on the front are

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.500 
bit better the antennas on the front are
gone<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.410> let's<00:03:40.410> take<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> look<00:03:40.859> at<00:03:41.450> how<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
gone so let's take a look at how the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:53.300 
gone so let's take a look at how the
ship<00:03:42.840> looks<00:03:43.459> lit<00:03:44.459> up

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.910 

so<00:03:54.310> here's<00:03:54.820> how<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.090> looks<00:03:55.270> lit<00:03:55.960> I<00:03:56.260> only<00:03:56.680> did

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
so here's how it looks lit I only did

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.370 
so here's how it looks lit I only did
the<00:03:57.070> front<00:03:57.250> area<00:03:57.520> here<00:03:57.850> and<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:01.390> clear<00:04:02.170> coat

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
the front area here and the clear coat

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.530 
the front area here and the clear coat
definitely<00:04:02.920> took<00:04:03.130> down<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.730> lot<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.270> lens

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
definitely took down a lot of lens

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.050 
definitely took down a lot of lens
