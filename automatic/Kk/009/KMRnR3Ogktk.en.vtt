going to be like during the summer
because<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.080> read<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:23.440> during<00:05:23.710> like<00:05:23.890> a

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
because I read this during like a

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.400 
because I read this during like a
blizzard<00:05:24.760> where<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.210> was<00:05:25.420> home<00:05:25.630> from<00:05:25.930> school

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410
