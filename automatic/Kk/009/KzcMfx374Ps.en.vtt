00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 pipe dismantled and bricks all elongated 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 had to swing far to him 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.450
 that fence did not touch threw a big force 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.310
 so that the bricks fence flew over and not 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:27.840
 have fallen there every brick now 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 cleaned and residues from this solution 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.040
 by the way here was a solution than it is days 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.020
 cement and earthen it right 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 done because he could not he 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 constantly absorbs condensate afterwards 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 gives away 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 and the pipe is constantly dry this here 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.449
 properly done and permanent the core 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.210
 sweeping sweeping and gonna 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.820
 trowel the atmosphere of such a hostess took 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.390
 old old 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.650
 little by little begins little by little 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.650
 pull one side to the other and 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.860
 starts quietly sweeping and here 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.790
 sweeping one way as well 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.790
 less so that this garbage fell there 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 so look like this is our pipe 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:49.500
 let's see what we have when we 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.909
 we will be laying new brick 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.570
 watch it 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.709
 what's the difference what is there in general pipe 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.500
 inside what solution was inside 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.500
 flowed and remained if it is a curve 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.679
 if so look he looks 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:33.840
 see alone floating a single wall 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:39.829
 flat bottom here I specifically do under 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:45.750
 the size of this brick and this gap 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:48.680
 doing here and so on and on 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.680
 goes on cement mortar 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.620
 now between the need to do the whole 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.540
 garbage need to sweep because you can 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:11.360
 get up and roll and fly there need 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.730
 go there push the pipe and it all now 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.480
 I will remove to do the solution 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.270
 I will raise it here brick and brick 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:43.240
 wet and could i lay on 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:43.240
 cement mortar all bye
