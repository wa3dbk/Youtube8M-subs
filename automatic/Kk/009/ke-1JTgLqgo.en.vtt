00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the glitch was happening and then about

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630 
the glitch was happening and then about
three-quarters<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> game<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.040> switches

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
three-quarters of the game it switches

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
three-quarters of the game it switches
over<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.030> my<00:00:36.420> actual<00:00:36.719> live<00:00:37.200> recording<00:00:39.110> not<00:00:40.110> my

even<00:00:43.920> notice<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> difference<00:00:45.200> it's<00:00:46.200> during<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
even notice the difference it's during a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
even notice the difference it's during a
transition<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.219> map<00:00:47.789> levels<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
transition of map levels or the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.560 
transition of map levels or the
transition<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.899> what's<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> word<00:00:52.280> rounds

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
transition of a what's the word rounds

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.790 
transition of a what's the word rounds
but<00:00:54.570> yeah<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but yeah so as you can see this is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
but yeah so as you can see this is
theater<00:00:55.980> mode<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.610> die<00:00:56.760> in

coming<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.700> yep<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.610> am<00:01:11.610> using

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
coming back here here yep so I am using

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.399 
coming back here here yep so I am using
the<00:01:12.119> l<00:01:12.240> 96<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.740> warlord

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
the l 96 as you can see with warlord

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
the l 96 as you can see with warlord
variable<00:01:16.409> zoom<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> extended<00:01:17.610> mags<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.270> think

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
scopes within about like ten seconds of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's not i want to normally upload
that<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.790> there<00:02:05.790> wasn't<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.119> glitch<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.780> if

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that if there wasn't a glitch that if

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.240 
that if there wasn't a glitch that if
that<00:02:07.049> happened<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.680> you'll<00:02:07.829> see<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> glitch

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that happened and you'll see the glitch

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
that happened and you'll see the glitch
the<00:02:08.429> glitch<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.640> um<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.140> my

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the glitch is um it's actually with my

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.910 
the glitch is um it's actually with my
sniper<00:02:10.619> rifle

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
sniper rifle

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.790 
sniper rifle
and<00:02:12.300> talk<00:02:13.300> more<00:02:13.540> about<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.870> when<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.080> get<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.770> it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
and talk more about it when I get to it

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.070 
and talk more about it when I get to it
but<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.069> think<00:02:15.209> it's<00:02:16.209> because<00:02:16.360> my<00:02:16.569> game<00:02:16.900> is

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
but I think it's because my game is

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.949 
but I think it's because my game is
scratched<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.489> downloaded<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:21.959> game

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
scratched and then I downloaded my game

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.860 
scratched and then I downloaded my game
onto<00:02:23.260> my<00:02:23.560> xbox<00:02:24.190> while<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.640> was<00:02:24.760> scratched<00:02:25.060> so

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
onto my xbox while it was scratched so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.210 
onto my xbox while it was scratched so
maybe<00:02:26.050> there's<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.709> little<00:02:26.890> glitch<00:02:27.390> that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
maybe there's a little glitch that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.440 
maybe there's a little glitch that
happens<00:02:30.220> every<00:02:30.550> once<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.790> while<00:02:30.819> because<00:02:31.090> I've

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
happens every once a while because I've

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.809 
happens every once a while because I've
had<00:02:31.480> happen<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.080> time<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.620> one<00:02:33.400> other<00:02:33.550> time

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
had happen this time in one other time

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.130 
had happen this time in one other time
and<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:35.110> other<00:02:35.230> time<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:36.720> don't<00:02:37.720> know<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.810> just

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
and the other time I don't know I just

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
and the other time I don't know I just
didn't<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.620> wii<00:02:38.769> games<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.130> wasn't<00:02:39.280> posted

didn't get the wii games I wasn't posted

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.259 
didn't get the wii games I wasn't posted
and<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.090> one<00:02:40.209> was<00:02:40.330> better<00:02:40.510> anyways<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.620> uh

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
and this one was better anyways so uh

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.490 
and this one was better anyways so uh
I'm<00:02:43.269> at<00:02:43.360> school<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.690> think<00:02:43.930> Bray<00:02:44.140> yeah<00:02:44.290> right

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
I'm at school I think Bray yeah right

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.190 
I'm at school I think Bray yeah right
here<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:46.000> when<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.209> first<00:02:46.450> actually<00:02:46.959> start

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
here is when I first actually start

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.259 
here is when I first actually start
noticing<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.830> glitch<00:02:48.069> but<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.090> won't

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
noticing the glitch but you won't

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.699 
noticing the glitch but you won't
because<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.630> doesn't<00:02:49.870> show<00:02:50.049> up<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.380> theater

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
because it doesn't show up in theater

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.039 
because it doesn't show up in theater
mode<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.640> I'm<00:02:51.730> kind<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.569> looking<00:02:52.750> weird

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
mode so I'm kind of like looking weird

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.110 
mode so I'm kind of like looking weird
right<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.890> like<00:02:54.640> looking<00:02:54.850> down<00:02:55.000> my

right now like just like looking down my

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.000 
right now like just like looking down my
scope<00:02:55.330> for<00:02:55.480> no<00:02:55.569> reason<00:02:55.870> although<00:02:56.739> that<00:02:56.890> guy

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
scope for no reason although that guy

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.150 
scope for no reason although that guy
just<00:02:57.069> got<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> cool<00:02:57.610> triple<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:59.019> uh<00:02:59.160> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
just got like a cool triple but uh the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.620 
just got like a cool triple but uh the
next<00:03:00.489> round<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.000> when<00:03:01.150> i<00:03:01.180> switch<00:03:01.540> over<00:03:01.840> into<00:03:02.380> my

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
next round is when i switch over into my

to happen multiple times to make that is

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.840 
to happen multiple times to make that is
probably<00:04:14.500> because<00:04:14.590> my<00:04:15.250> disc<00:04:15.550> is<00:04:15.700> scratched
