 we are in watch bucks good the truth 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.730
 is that I have mooled a lot of white sox the 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.510
 been testing half an hour more or less 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.970
 a goal happens to me as it rains the mission 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.560
 main and such and good as you can see 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.900
 in the title today I come to bring you a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.240
 little trick, do not tell me to say this 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.340
 they are bugs that good is not the same as 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.930
 the gta is worth say there are many 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.780
 very easy ways to get money 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.640
 they also cost their time but good and 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.890
 being the second day that is we can 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.290
 get money in different ways you 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.060
 We give to inspect to be valid and here 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.950
 we can see the identity of the 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.950
 people for example this earns 20,000 is 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.530
 line cook we give to hack 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.800
 ballet and once we loja 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.870
 here we can the conversation to see it to 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.329
 I take it off I do not get fashionable we go to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.299
 look for someone that we can hack 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.740
 ok look these just collide here 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.020
 they are here discussing the truth that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.359
 It's cool the game, let's see this one 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.359
 ok says he has in his account he has 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:18.520
 euros or dollars or whatever then 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.380
 Once we have your data worth what 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.250
 we have to search and we can remove 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.469
 this is a one box to remove it and not 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.799
 here is one for example on the map we 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.780
 they come out as little cards and it's from the cashier 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.980
 automatic we give you 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.860
 oh perfect and good 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.120
 because the information and take the money and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.190
 well we can do this 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.060
 for a little while I can see that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.340
 I already have 2000 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.980

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.940

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.290
 go up a lot and you can lol 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.670
 something has leaped from my computer and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.960
 you can improve a lot 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.550
 there are things that cool a lot like 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.740
 example are you walking here and from 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.010
 Suddenly you wait for this guy to pass and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.010
