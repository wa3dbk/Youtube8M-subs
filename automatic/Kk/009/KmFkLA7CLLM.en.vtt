00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.700
 do not 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.949
 i 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.279
 do not try to gain strength without having 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 wins road down the path that follows 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.189
 my career many want to get to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 the goal 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.380
 I prefer to overcome my mind which is the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 that challenges me smoke signals in the form of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.579
 hoops when crossed the sea I feel a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.649
 Castaway because I do not know what to think 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.380
 when I have you by my side because I do not know 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.940
 how to act with closed eyes 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 I breathe and advanced I throw my thoughts 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 everything is perfect and in a second it stops 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.930
 be it soldiers defend a sunken country 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.149
 in failure we go from fulfilling dreams 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.429
 and try to recover them you do not listen 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.929
 if they want to cheat you respect who 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.539
 Respect there is no one to beg to pray 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.489
 lack humility for a future power 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 change that they do not play with the money of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 our bread stanza I learned to get up 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.539
 of all the blows I emitted nostalgia 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.789
 Seeing me alone every night sitting 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.620
 writing in my room assimilating that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.870
 time goes slow if the torment continues 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.940
 squeezing smiled to life she follows me 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.670
 I want to stop it although there are times when 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.740
 rope tightens more from children than 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 weak strength now I feel 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.150
 full of pride and not extreme 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.150
 and you can not understand 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.730
 and that life is two days everything can 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.730
 happen imagine 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.110
 life are your you I go back I rise like a 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.510
 black crow I do not believe in creeds but I 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.550
 I turned again to see it fall I had noticed it 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.950
 the touch of your hair jealousy I have to the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.930
 moon for keeping me awake is true 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 in the neighborhood the light of night that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 slowly I will not cry a rosary asking 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.870
 Only space clemency is what I want 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 in this world and put so empty flavor 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.220
 sour that only smiles at me in moments 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.320
 cool as a kid ride and follow the path 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.970
 of the river details this end or I write what 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.550
 I feel and live I say what I want 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.979
 say say to express that not all 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.710
 the doors will remain closed defending 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.810
 my people for them I give the rats face 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.640
 skinny girls will be scared to death 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.770
 I fight to survive in a world 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.930
 versatile when they spend and have not seen 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.190
 run blood on a tapestry in short a 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.260
 story that seeks the light of the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.180
 darkness I understood that you can if you want 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.459
 for your life fight to continue towards 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.350
 go ahead and not look back yet 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.660
 there is a lot of pig for so little stable 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.660
 everything goes on and changes on the path that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.370
 you walk sweet words turn bitter 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.400
 small moments bring memories 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.710
 unforgettable in this jungle I feel and 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.630
 vulnerable 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.630
 and you can not understand 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:54.180
 that life is two days everything can 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.180
 happen imagine 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.219
 I go out and looking 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.219
 but let's see
