00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:12.660
 things from so I'll start first 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.880
 Product are soy flakes from a gate 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 to the dm 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 I bought them because they are pretty 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.519
 imaginative that means on 100 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:32.880
 gram they have 50 8 we have too 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 Do not buy again because I have them 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.160
 bought for the first and last time 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.230
 because I really ran her right 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.469
 So really disgusting the taste 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 I can not really do it right 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.660
 describe and how it started 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.910
 but still really bad afterwards 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 and I do not know what I mean with that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 All the pack should make so many 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.699
 wrote to instagram that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 you can bake it well and that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.039

 out if I liked maybe 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.940
 But they will probably try first 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.489
 a bit in the closet because I 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.260
