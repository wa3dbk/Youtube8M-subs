00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.550 
water instead I'm going to get my pan on
a<00:00:28.220> low<00:00:28.580> heat<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:29.090> slowly<00:00:29.660> dissolve<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.529> sugar

and once it's completely dissolved I'm

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.530 
and once it's completely dissolved I'm
going<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.620> turn<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.070> heat<00:00:34.220> up<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:34.760> reduce<00:00:35.330> it

going to turn the heat up and reduce it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.600 
going to turn the heat up and reduce it
down<00:00:35.720> so<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.050> becomes<00:00:36.350> thick<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.070> syrup<00:00:37.670> like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
down so it becomes thick and syrup like

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.219 
down so it becomes thick and syrup like
so<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:40.729> is<00:00:40.850> going<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.150> take<00:00:41.330> around<00:00:41.540> six<00:00:42.110> to

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
so this is going to take around six to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:49.630 
so this is going to take around six to
seven<00:00:42.559> minutes<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:48.320> I'm<00:00:48.530> using<00:00:48.769> red<00:00:49.190> currants

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
seven minutes so I'm using red currants

to<00:00:59.960> burst<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:00.769> that'll<00:01:00.979> take<00:01:01.100> about<00:01:01.220> 30<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.940> 45

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
to burst and that'll take about 30 to 45

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.630 
to burst and that'll take about 30 to 45
seconds<00:01:02.960> take<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.619> off<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.010> heat<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.489> leave

any gaps so you can gently push it down
and<00:01:56.749> fan<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.289> round<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:59.259> if<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:00.560> any

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
and fan it round and if you have any

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.410 
and fan it round and if you have any
excess<00:02:01.219> at<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.490> end<00:02:01.609> that's<00:02:01.759> fine<00:02:02.090> because<00:02:02.240> we

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
excess at the end that's fine because we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.020 
excess at the end that's fine because we
can<00:02:02.600> trim<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:05.289> all<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.499> way<00:02:06.619> around

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
knife to release around the sides so I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.380 
knife to release around the sides so I
just<00:04:01.730> slide<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.420> in<00:04:02.890> gently<00:04:04.150> all<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.300> way

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
around now I'm doing this so it helps it

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.949 
around now I'm doing this so it helps it
release<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.210> and<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:11.360> should<00:04:11.540> slide<00:04:11.900> out

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
release it and it should slide out

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.320
