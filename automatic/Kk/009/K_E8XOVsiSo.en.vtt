00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
to just start going to start rolling up

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.200 
to just start going to start rolling up
a<00:00:25.430> a4<00:00:26.430> piece<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.760> paper<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.300> way<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:29.210> just

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
a a4 piece of paper this way so just

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.420 
a a4 piece of paper this way so just
like<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.599> about<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.410> width<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.949> finger

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
like this about the width your finger

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.690 
like this about the width your finger
would<00:00:32.489> say<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.840> precise<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.219> doesn't

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
would say it's not precise this doesn't

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
would say it's not precise this doesn't
take<00:00:35.880> precise<00:00:36.270> measurements<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.800> what

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
take precise measurements and then what

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:47.650 
take precise measurements and then what
you're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:41.600> tape<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:45.140> right

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
you're going to do just tape it up right

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
you're going to do just tape it up right
so<00:00:48.660> after<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.110> I'll<00:00:49.350> show<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.920> shooting

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so after this I'll show you the shooting

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.510 
so after this I'll show you the shooting
test<00:00:51.500> all<00:00:52.500> right<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.100> very<00:00:53.309> neat

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
test all right so that's not very neat

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.000 
test all right so that's not very neat
but<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> trick

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
but it will do the trick

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.529 
but it will do the trick
plain<00:00:56.010> barrel<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.969> now<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.239> you're<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
plain barrel so now what you're going to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.470 
plain barrel so now what you're going to
do<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.920> handle<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.270> another

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
do is make a handle so get another

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
do is make a handle so get another
eighth<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.930> plain<00:01:01.140> piece<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> paper<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.129> turn

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
eighth or plain piece of paper and turn

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
eighth or plain piece of paper and turn
it<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.120> way<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.170> simply<00:01:04.439> cut<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.920> down

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it this way and just simply cut it down

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.130 
it this way and just simply cut it down
the<00:01:05.309> middle<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.450> measure<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:06.990> you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the middle you can measure it if you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.880 
the middle you can measure it if you
wish<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.930> advise<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.350> because

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
wish but I advise you not to because

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.969 
wish but I advise you not to because
it's<00:01:11.070> easier<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:12.350> cut<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> straight<00:01:13.710> down

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it's easier just cut it straight down

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
it's easier just cut it straight down
the<00:01:14.130> middle<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:18.420> just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the middle just like that and then just

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
the middle just like that and then just
roll<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:20.540> same<00:01:21.540> again<00:01:21.869> roll<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.590> quite<00:01:22.860> big

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
roll it same again roll it quite big

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.420 
roll it same again roll it quite big
because<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> handle<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.630> depends

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
because this is the handle so it depends

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.690 
because this is the handle so it depends
how<00:01:26.430> thick<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.140> just

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
how thick you on it like that and just

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
how thick you on it like that and just
tape<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.939> again<00:01:39.710> like<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:41.880> what

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
tape it up again like this so now what

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.590 
tape it up again like this so now what
you're<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:43.340> you're<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:46.560> side<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.970> paper<00:01:48.320> handle<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
take one side of the paper handle and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.039 
take one side of the paper handle and
cut<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.790> then

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
cut like this just go like that and then

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.030 
cut like this just go like that and then
depending<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
depending on which way you want it you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.539 
depending on which way you want it you
can<00:01:59.189> either<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> like<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:01.250> with<00:02:02.250> two

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
can either have it like this with two

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.260 
can either have it like this with two
handles<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.899> same<00:02:04.140> again<00:02:04.549> or<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> cut

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
handles so the same again or you can cut

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.229 
handles so the same again or you can cut
out<00:02:06.350> another<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.069> slits<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
out another one of these slits on the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.270 
out another one of these slits on the
other<00:02:09.450> side<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> whole<00:02:10.379> tube<00:02:10.679> fits<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
other side so the whole tube fits in the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.000 
other side so the whole tube fits in the
hand

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
hand

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.979 
hand
so<00:02:16.220> now<00:02:17.220> I've<00:02:17.310> done<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:18.450> easily<00:02:18.720> just

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
so now I've done that it easily just

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.040 
so now I've done that it easily just
fits<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.250> barrel<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:20.879> this<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.420> then

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
fits in the barrel like this and then

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.199 
fits in the barrel like this and then
just<00:02:22.290> simply<00:02:23.090> tape<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.970> I'm

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
just simply tape it on just like I'm

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.680 
just simply tape it on just like I'm
doing<00:02:27.540> now<00:02:31.640> right<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:33.060> that's<00:02:33.300> done<00:02:33.480> you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
doing now right so now that's done you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.150 
doing now right so now that's done you
can<00:02:33.720> make<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.230> lot<00:02:34.380> more<00:02:34.560> secure<00:02:34.890> than<00:02:35.040> I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
can make it a lot more secure than I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.759 
can make it a lot more secure than I

camp I'm just giving you an example so
you've<00:02:37.890> got<00:02:38.069> your<00:02:38.160> main<00:02:38.400> gun<00:02:38.790> structure<00:02:39.599> so

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you've got your main gun structure so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.869 
you've got your main gun structure so
now<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.860> want<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.310> make<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.640> dart

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
now what you want to do is make the dart

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.800 
now what you want to do is make the dart
so<00:02:42.209> if<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.420> put<00:02:42.599> your<00:02:42.690> gun<00:02:42.930> aside<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:44.810> just

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
so if you put your gun aside and just

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.420 
so if you put your gun aside and just
hone<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:47.250> piece<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.519> April<00:02:47.970> paper<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.950> just

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
hone up a piece of April paper so just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.600 
hone up a piece of April paper so just
roll<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:52.519> this

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.059 

in<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.760> cone<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:58.730> this<00:03:00.680> bit<00:03:01.680> further<00:03:01.890> than

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
in a cone like this bit further than

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.000 
in a cone like this bit further than
that<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.760> cone<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.390> quite<00:03:03.660> tight<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.860> is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that so just cone it quite tight this is

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.660 
that so just cone it quite tight this is
going<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> be<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.459> bullet<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.780> paper<00:03:07.079> dart

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to be your bullet the paper dart

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.830 
going to be your bullet the paper dart
the<00:03:08.670> lips<00:03:09.380> all<00:03:10.380> right<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.890> better<00:03:11.840> good

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the lips all right this is better good

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.050 
the lips all right this is better good
so<00:03:13.319> now<00:03:13.500> I've<00:03:13.650> combed<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.849> bit

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
so now I've combed that just get a bit

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
tape and attach it on like so now what

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.949 
tape and attach it on like so now what
you<00:03:23.459> want<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.639> do<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.090> your<00:03:24.299> gun<00:03:24.720> that

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
you've made and just simply put the dart

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.030 
you've made and just simply put the dart
inside<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.269> where<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.840> ends<00:03:34.530> you're<00:03:34.859> just

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
inside and where it ends you're just

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.349 
inside and where it ends you're just
going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.250> cut<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:36.019> going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.079> simply<00:03:38.359> cut

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
going to cut just going to simply cut

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.559 
going to cut just going to simply cut
where<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.780> ends<00:03:40.170> nice<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.130> easy

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
where it ends nice and easy

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.660 
where it ends nice and easy
one<00:03:42.569> snip<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.319> then<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.620> check<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:44.370> fits

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
one snip and then you can check it fits

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.840 
one snip and then you can check it fits
so<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.480> fits<00:03:45.750> nicely<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.549> that<00:03:47.549> shoots

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
so that fits nicely and that shoots

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.300 
so that fits nicely and that shoots
nicely<00:03:48.359> as<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.780> see<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.889> can<00:03:49.950> make<00:03:50.160> as

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
nicely as you can see so you can make as

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.309 
nicely as you can see so you can make as
many<00:03:50.430> darts<00:03:50.790> as<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.120> want<00:03:51.329> but<00:03:51.630> now<00:03:52.079> I'm<00:03:52.170> going

out for now and put it not down the
middle<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.819> probably<00:04:06.209> you'll<00:04:06.630> think<00:04:06.900> I'm

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
middle like probably you'll think I'm

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.289

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
going to put it on the side because I

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.339 
going to put it on the side because I
found<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.690> works<00:04:09.810> better<00:04:10.169> on<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.709> side<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
found it works better on the side and

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:18.959 
found it works better on the side and
you<00:04:13.349> just<00:04:13.380> tape<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.889> on<00:04:15.139> like<00:04:16.139> this

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:18.969 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:24.570 

just<00:04:19.969> like<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.479> maybe<00:04:21.259> another<00:04:21.590> bit<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.889> tape

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.029 

like<00:04:25.580> this<00:04:26.229> alright<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:27.289> once<00:04:27.620> that's<00:04:27.830> done

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
like this alright so once that's done

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.140 
you can add as many cocktail sticks as
possible<00:04:30.379> and<00:04:30.620> now<00:04:31.580> we're<00:04:31.729> going<00:04:31.819> to<00:04:31.879> do<00:04:32.060> the
