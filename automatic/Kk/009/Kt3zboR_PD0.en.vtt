00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.590
 so here is the cb 52 ch effect only that 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.369
 is in no friction fluid swivel that 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.300
 so is very very very handy for 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.450
 small goals like big TV 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.730
 there big advantage of his kneecaps fluid to 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.460
 friction is that we have here a wheel 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.610
 for frictions adjustment that allows 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:38.270
 to choose the friction of the ball here 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.280
 in the receptacle underneath and over the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.710
 friction is strong more in fresnes 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.010
 but it depends on the weight of the device 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.030
 the goal is on we just have 7 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 this setting 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.720
 once it has been adjusted more to say 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.690
 touch one manipulates 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.100
 the lens him where the camera there 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.380
 stays in place when released 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.680
 it's great so here are the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.189
 different settings of the ball 52 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.570
 single girl so here the most setting 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.450
 important adjustment of the friction 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.760
 so we see here when gerard dropped there 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.040
 the fri sion was completely free 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.159
 so just adjust a little bit 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.470
 pressure and then we have more or 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.510
 less hard you are sure when you want so 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.250
 here we all have movements that we 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.960
 wants and when we release it holds in 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.950
 place that's what's important it's 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.710
 it's able to make a setting without 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.510
 have to retouch to succeed whatever 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.970
 thing and make his soul to a 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.060
 relatively complex manipulation and 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.100
 when we hear of making a bet 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.799
 point can clarify when one when one to 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.299
 the action of an animal happening in front of 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.450
 you waited for us for two hours 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.510
 in an overheated carriage must not be 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.170
 plant in the settings there is not 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.900
 settings to do 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.080
 it turns alone here just this one 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.330
 after here you have a setting for 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 the horizon 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.230
 if you want to block 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 Here friction streets end settings 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 so to English more or less oral 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.210
 will allow to refine this 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.330
 friction adjustment and then on the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.010
 side fine tuning it's not settings 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.180
 it's the blocking handle and 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:39.780
 unblocking beyond the board here the little 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.940
 button for for security not that the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:52.770
 tray goes all alone backwards or in 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:55.830
 before level 2 of the board 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.900
 it is an arched plateau arca switzerland so 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.960
 which will allow to mount on 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.000
 for example a quick bag and all the 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.740
 range 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.350
 Swiss harkat from wimbée relais 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.140
 since wimbée raises in all a pile of 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.990
 tray that we stock for all 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.840
 objectives that exist in the market 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.850
 that's something really and more 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.670
 really cheap really cheap by 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.210
 compared to a patella of a mark 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.210
 prestigious
