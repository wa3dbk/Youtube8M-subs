00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.020
 today we are going to make noodles with clams 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.660
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:25.610
 they are noodles white wine oil salt 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:31.070
 green pepper onion tomato garlic 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.070
 clams or chirla and saffron 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.480
 the first thing we have done nothing more 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.910
 buy them chila in a bowl 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.219
 water with salt and put them inside this 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 way they are going to open up and the sand 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.320
 have it going to go pressing 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.420
 in a saucepan we have poured oil and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.289
 Now take the onion very chopped 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.289
 Water 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.870
 and finally to pepper 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.400
 We carry all this and we will have it 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.940
 until the vegetables become 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.940
 tender 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.610
 once all the doubts have been 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.570
 posed they have put time we are going to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.890
 Take a good splash of white wine and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.680
 we have to let it go poor 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.570
 once the wine has improved we have 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.570
 could the tomato and then grated 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.230
 we have had the clam in the water 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.390
 boiling very little time the time 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.450
 that they open now let's take with 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.500
 help of a colander and this water that has 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.650
 released all the taste of the clam the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.610
 let's throw in our rehash and go 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.610
 to wait for it to boil 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.040
 fenced is boiling we are going to throw 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.940
 the noodles and we're going to have it until 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.940
 get soft 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.170
 while the videos are being made I'm going 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.230
 to show how the clams are 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.810
 they are very clean 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.409
 and there are no traces of sand with the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.049
 trick that is said it is important that 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.610
 the clam you have about 30 40 seconds 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.940
 in the boiling water the taste for 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.440
 is open and not remain very dry when and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.080
 let's have the noodles, let's add the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.980
 clams once the videos are already 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.930
 facts we are going to incorporate the clams and 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.209
 with the fire already extinguished with the same 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.480
 heat that the noodles give off we go to 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.519
 have one about two 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.790
 minutes or so and I would be ready to 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.790
 eat
