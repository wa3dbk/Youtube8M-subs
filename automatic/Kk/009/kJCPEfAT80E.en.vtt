okay<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.740> test<00:00:02.570> to<00:00:03.570> observe<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay this is a test to observe the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.009 
okay this is a test to observe the
movement<00:00:05.540> or<00:00:06.540> lack<00:00:07.290> thereof<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.480> my<00:00:09.480> rack<00:00:09.809> and

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
movement or lack thereof of my rack and

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.200 
movement or lack thereof of my rack and
pinion<00:00:11.599> to<00:00:12.599> my<00:00:12.750> knowledge<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
pinion to my knowledge this is the

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.300 
pinion to my knowledge this is the
factory<00:00:15.770> rack<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> factory<00:00:18.240> bushings

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
factory rack with the factory bushings

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.170 
factory rack with the factory bushings
the<00:00:20.310> car<00:00:20.580> when<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> got<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.390> did<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.109> leak

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
the car when I got it did have a leak

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.349 
the car when I got it did have a leak
from<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> return<00:00:24.689> hose<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.730> bushings<00:00:27.180> may

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
from the return hose so the bushings may

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
from the return hose so the bushings may
have<00:00:27.599> been<00:00:27.810> contaminated<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.859> time<00:00:29.070> or

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
have been contaminated at one time or

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.209 
have been contaminated at one time or
another<00:00:29.660> I've<00:00:30.660> never<00:00:31.019> noticed<00:00:31.260> any

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.780 

fluctuation<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.399> center<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
fluctuation in the center of the of the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.619 
fluctuation in the center of the of the
steering<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> assume<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.570> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
steering so I'm going to assume that I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.670 
steering so I'm going to assume that I
do<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.110> any<00:00:43.590> rack<00:00:43.890> movement<00:00:45.680> for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
do not have any rack movement for

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
do not have any rack movement for
testing<00:00:47.129> purposes<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:50.120> 87<00:00:51.120> turbo

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
testing purposes this is a 87 turbo

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.180 
testing purposes this is a 87 turbo
build<00:00:52.020> date<00:00:52.340> for<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.640> 87<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> am<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.129> going

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
build date for of 87 so I am now going

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
build date for of 87 so I am now going
to<00:00:58.760> move<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> steering<00:01:00.120> from<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> left

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
to move the steering from right to left

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.799 
to move the steering from right to left
with<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.590> engine<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.510> will<00:01:03.690> do

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
with the engine off and then I will do

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.539 
with the engine off and then I will do
it<00:01:04.040> again<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> engine<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.430> we

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it again with the engine on so here we

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:27.609 
it again with the engine on so here we
go

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.050 

staring<00:01:28.619> centered<00:01:28.950> right<00:01:29.130> now<00:01:29.310> turning<00:01:29.759> all

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
staring centered right now turning all

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.000
