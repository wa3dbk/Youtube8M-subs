00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 what I can to save them 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.600

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.770

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.149

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.810
 inferior creatures and they deserve to die 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.640
