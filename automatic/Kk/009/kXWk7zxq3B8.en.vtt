00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.090
 I am at home and also delighted 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.490
 come back to have one more day in this 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.650
 life section of the rai is silvia ago 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.010
 a few months or good a few weeks ago or 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.590
 a month or so and we talked about what 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.020
 kind of routines I follow when doing 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.240
 exercise and so I lost so much 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.970
 weight 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.760
 I explained the type of diet that I 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 I took that is not a diet is a diet 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.490
 it's just normal eating without eating 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.990
 many hydrates and obviously removing 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.130
 short tail 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.130
 fresh fast food and others and you 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.170
 he explained that such a great scenario 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.000
 I usually eat dinner more or less 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.610
 same and solve some dishes that I 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.440
 invented I good one yes and the other no and 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.350
 that normally I usually do it as 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.270
 three or four times a week many 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.950
 you have wondered what it was me I have 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.480
 told is the avocado with tuna and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.430
 then another one that also usually does now 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.030
 it's a cucumber salad with tomato 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 then today I'm recorded how to do it 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.700
 because many things you have written to me 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.640
 how do you make the avocado with tuna then 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.040
 I've recorded a video on how to make 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.530
 prepare this dish that has nothing but 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.369
 five minutes and that I do not cook 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.490
 nothing I do so I'm going to leave you with 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.830
 today's video that I hope you like 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.450
 that you take nothing and that you can 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.840
 put into practice for our dinners 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 the avocado still having fat is a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.030
 good fat and at night and the truth 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.729
 is that at least it satisfies me 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.429
 quite and what I do is that 90 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.409
 I have no desire to eat more so I 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.340
 I leave with the video that I have prepared 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.200
 on how to perform or how to prepare 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.909
 avocado with tuna see you the week 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.909
 that comes a huge big kiss 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.670
 an avocado tuna preferably in 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.240
 Modena Vinegar Not Pickled 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.280
 and olive oil once we have all 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.680
 the prepared ingredients we take the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.970
 avocado and we split it in two we opened it 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.120
 and we get everything that is the good part 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.770
 of the avocado we are putting it in a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 dish or in a bowl as you see and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.640
 what we are going to do is break it into 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.360
 bits so we can eat it later 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.360
 much better 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.330
 when we already have the avocado in pieces 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.580
 what we do is that we take the can of 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.470
 tuna remember that I told you to be 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.200
 possible is for me it is much better 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.210
 tuna oil pickled not the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.220
 we open and we dump it inside 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.210
 pieces that we have prepared with the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.210
 avocado and has split 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.570
 once we have prepared the avocado and 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.600
 the tuna we take a splash of oil 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.360
 olive oil and we also throw a 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.280
 little bit of vinegar of modena that already 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.290
 I like the consumer I like it 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.140
 enough oil because I like the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.640
 things very very sour but that is already going to 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.640
 depend on you 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.400
 and here you have the result avocado with 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.350
 Tuna is very simple to do really 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.990
 which has no complication takes 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.030
 5 minutes and you can dine healthy and 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.030
 healthy practically every day
