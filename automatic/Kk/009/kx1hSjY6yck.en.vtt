lead eventually to a toothache and a

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.040 
lead eventually to a toothache and a
dead<00:00:35.140> nerve<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:36.239> finally<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.300> fractured<00:00:37.840> tooth

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 

when<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.129> look<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> situation<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.600> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
when we look at a situation like this in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
when we look at a situation like this in
the<00:00:45.870> diagram<00:00:46.320> everything<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:47.399> happy<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the diagram everything looks happy and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.760 
the diagram everything looks happy and
healthy

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.060 

but<00:00:51.370> yet<00:00:51.670> there<00:00:51.940> may<00:00:52.150> be<00:00:52.180> an<00:00:52.690> underlying<00:00:53.500> risk

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
but yet there may be an underlying risk

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.950 
but yet there may be an underlying risk
that<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.580> patient<00:00:55.030> or<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.390> person<00:00:55.840> is

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
that the patient or the person is

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.190 
that the patient or the person is
unaware<00:00:56.350> of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.940 

feeling<00:01:00.040> good<00:01:00.220> so<00:01:01.290> why<00:01:02.290> worry<00:01:02.620> about

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
feeling good so why worry about

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.520 
feeling good so why worry about
something<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.490> isn't<00:01:03.850> broken<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:05.379> not

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
something that isn't broken let's not

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.520 
something that isn't broken let's not
pick<00:01:05.860> something<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.430> we<00:01:06.580> don't<00:01:06.760> have<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.530> well

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
pick something if we don't have to well

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.040 
pick something if we don't have to well
that<00:01:09.040> may<00:01:09.340> be<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.610> mistake<00:01:09.910> especially<00:01:10.840> if<00:01:10.930> you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
that may be a mistake especially if you

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.980 
that may be a mistake especially if you
can<00:01:11.230> identify<00:01:12.150> things<00:01:13.150> are<00:01:13.450> headed<00:01:13.720> in<00:01:13.870> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
can identify things are headed in the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.230 
can identify things are headed in the
wrong<00:01:14.200> direction<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.310> can<00:01:15.490> intercept

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
wrong direction and you can intercept

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.780 
wrong direction and you can intercept
that<00:01:16.360> disease<00:01:16.930> process<00:01:17.470> before<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.220> ever

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
that disease process before it ever

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.990 
that disease process before it ever
takes<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.300> toll<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.400> if<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.580> look<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.880> little

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
takes a toll so if we look a little

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.990 
takes a toll so if we look a little
closer<00:01:22.390> at<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.780> disease<00:01:23.290> process<00:01:23.950> take<00:01:24.729> away

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
closer at the disease process take away

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.500 
closer at the disease process take away
the<00:01:25.150> gum<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.710> can<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.130> inside<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.760> tooth

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
the gum and we can see inside the tooth

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.230 
the gum and we can see inside the tooth
we<00:01:30.110> can<00:01:30.290> see<00:01:30.530> through<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.190> gum<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.850> see<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
we can see through the gum and see the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.090 
we can see through the gum and see the
nerve<00:01:32.450> in<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.690> tooth

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.310 

we<00:01:37.340> can<00:01:37.490> also<00:01:37.640> see<00:01:38.000> where<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.330> tooth<00:01:38.540> contacts

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
we can also see where the tooth contacts

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.859 
we can also see where the tooth contacts
the<00:01:39.560> adjacent<00:01:40.130> teeth<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.420> typically

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
the adjacent teeth and this is typically

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.560 
the adjacent teeth and this is typically
where<00:01:42.350> those<00:01:42.920> minor<00:01:43.400> problems<00:01:44.150> can<00:01:44.390> get

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
where those minor problems can get

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.740 
where those minor problems can get
started<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.259> little<00:01:46.040> decay<00:01:46.580> starts<00:01:47.180> right<00:01:47.540> at

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
started a little decay starts right at

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.320 
started a little decay starts right at
the<00:01:47.869> contact<00:01:48.350> or<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.950> below<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.670> contact

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
the contact or just below that contact

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.690 
the contact or just below that contact
point<00:01:50.630> where<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.899> teeth<00:01:51.140> touch<00:01:51.700> absolutely

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
point where the teeth touch absolutely

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.359 
point where the teeth touch absolutely
no<00:01:52.850> pain<00:01:53.119> everything<00:01:53.720> looks<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.470> feels<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
no pain everything looks and feels the

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.850 
no pain everything looks and feels the
same<00:01:55.640> as<00:01:55.909> normal

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.950 

the<00:01:59.400> decay<00:01:59.790> penetrates<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.810> bit

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the decay penetrates a little bit

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.700 
the decay penetrates a little bit
further

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
further

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.420 
further
it<00:02:03.280> gets<00:02:03.520> through<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.060> enamel<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:05.310> into<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
it gets through the enamel and into the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.449 
it gets through the enamel and into the
next<00:02:06.610> layer<00:02:06.940> called<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.479> dentin<00:02:08.459> there's

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
next layer called the dentin there's

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.910 
next layer called the dentin there's
still<00:02:09.819> no<00:02:10.090> pain<00:02:10.390> at<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.780> level<00:02:10.990> so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
still no pain at this level so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.100 
still no pain at this level so
everything<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.520> still<00:02:12.760> feeling<00:02:13.720> pretty<00:02:13.810> good

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
everything is still feeling pretty good

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.150 
everything is still feeling pretty good
and<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:15.069> along<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.640> normal<00:02:16.980> unless<00:02:17.980> it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
and going along just normal unless it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.270 
and going along just normal unless it
gets<00:02:18.310> detected<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.360> early<00:02:19.630> stage<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:21.010> can

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
gets detected at this early stage it can

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.500 
gets detected at this early stage it can
progress<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.930> decay<00:02:23.319> goes<00:02:23.560> deeper<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
progress the decay goes deeper and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.130 
progress the decay goes deeper and
starts<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.600> irritate<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.230> nerve<00:02:28.020> sometimes<00:02:29.020> a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
starts to irritate the nerve sometimes a

develops<00:02:41.010> further<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.910> nerve<00:02:42.120> starts<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.750> die

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
develops further the nerve starts to die

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.890 
develops further the nerve starts to die
the<00:02:43.770> toothache<00:02:44.190> may<00:02:44.430> become<00:02:44.850> severe

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
this full extent of the decay and now

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.420 
this full extent of the decay and now
