look like screw threads they're not
really<00:00:35.489> screw<00:00:35.820> threads<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.390> basically<00:00:37.380> you

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
really screw threads but basically you

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
really screw threads but basically you
just<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.070> poke<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just have to kind of poke these into the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
just have to kind of poke these into the
fabric<00:00:39.660> cut<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.320> hole<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> need<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
fabric cut a little hole if you need to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
fabric cut a little hole if you need to
or<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.670> probably<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.870> sock

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
I might be able to just kind of poke it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
I might be able to just kind of poke it
through<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> threads<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
through some of the threads and then you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
through some of the threads and then you
have<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.829> other<00:00:46.980> part<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.850> come<00:00:48.059> with

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
have this other part that will come with

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.720 
have this other part that will come with
the<00:00:48.300> eye<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.219> guess

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the eye it's kind of like the I guess

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
the eye it's kind of like the I guess
sort<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> back<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.719> snap<00:00:52.050> or

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
something like that and then once you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
something like that and then once you
kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.770> put<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.219> Oh<00:00:56.460> once<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
kind of you know put one Oh once you

kind of put one into the other one on
the<00:00:59.039> front<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> fabric<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.930> where

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the front of the fabric you know where

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
the front of the fabric you know where
the<00:01:01.170> eye<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.489> side

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the eye is and then one on the back side

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.000 
the eye is and then one on the back side
then<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> pinch<00:01:03.780> them<00:01:03.930> together<00:01:04.049> it'll<00:01:04.920> make

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
then you pinch them together it'll make

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
then you pinch them together it'll make
a<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.309> nice<00:01:05.460> tight<00:01:05.820> fit<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.360> probably

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
a really nice tight fit and probably

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
a really nice tight fit and probably
won't<00:01:07.439> come<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.770> once<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.909> that
