with<00:02:37.350> chelsea<00:02:37.770> at<00:02:37.860> home<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.160> Sunderland<00:02:38.370> I

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
with chelsea at home to Sunderland I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.640 
with chelsea at home to Sunderland I
think<00:02:39.300> even<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:39.660> coster<00:02:40.020> isn't<00:02:40.260> completely

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
think even if coster isn't completely

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.040 
think even if coster isn't completely
fit<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.190> long<00:02:41.610> as<00:02:41.790> he<00:02:41.880> plays<00:02:42.030> he's<00:02:42.660> still<00:02:42.930> in

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
fit as long as he plays he's still in

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.070 
fit as long as he plays he's still in
with<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.230> chance<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.560> getting<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.860> goal<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
with a chance of getting a goal and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.210 
with a chance of getting a goal and
finally<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.770> predict<00:02:47.010> that

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
finally I'm going to predict that

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.330 
finally I'm going to predict that
ballarin<00:02:47.610> will<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> good<00:02:48.360> week<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:49.340> I'm

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
ballarin will have a good week as I'm

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860 
ballarin will have a good week as I'm
making<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.760> video<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.270> lineups<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
making this video the lineups for the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.030 
making this video the lineups for the
game<00:02:52.020> against<00:02:52.290> Sunderland<00:02:52.709> have<00:02:52.890> been

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
game against Sunderland have been

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130 
game against Sunderland have been
released<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.670> Bellerin<00:02:54.420> will<00:02:54.600> be<00:02:54.720> starting

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
released and Bellerin will be starting

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.080 
released and Bellerin will be starting
again<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.100> looks<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.310> thing<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.730> has<00:02:56.910> got

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
again so it looks like thing it has got

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.000 
again so it looks like thing it has got
a<00:02:57.120> lot<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.420> faith<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:57.660> Him<00:02:57.990> because<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.770> far<00:02:58.830> as

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
a lot of faith in Him because as far as

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.250 
a lot of faith in Him because as far as
I'm<00:02:59.190> aware<00:02:59.250> Chambers<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.000> available<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:01.110> boo

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I'm aware Chambers is available the boo

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.620 
I'm aware Chambers is available the boo
she's<00:03:01.470> still<00:03:01.709> sidelined<00:03:02.220> however<00:03:02.630> Bellerin

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
she's still sidelined however Bellerin

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.030 
she's still sidelined however Bellerin
has<00:03:03.810> looked<00:03:04.050> stronger<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.530> forwards<00:03:04.890> all

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
has looked stronger in forwards all

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.949 
has looked stronger in forwards all
season<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.940> there<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.090> decent<00:03:06.600> attacking

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
season so there is decent attacking

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.990 
season so there is decent attacking
threat<00:03:07.200> with<00:03:07.350> him<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.520> West<00:03:08.760> Brom's

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
threat with him and with West Brom's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240 
threat with him and with West Brom's
tactics<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:10.290> see<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> game<00:03:10.709> being<00:03:10.950> quite

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
tactics I can see the game being quite

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.310 
tactics I can see the game being quite
low<00:03:11.459> scoring<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.780> Arsenal<00:03:13.110> might

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
low scoring and I think Arsenal might

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.500 
low scoring and I think Arsenal might
just<00:03:13.560> edgy<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.130> or<00:03:14.250> two<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.490> know<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.330> that's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
just edgy one or two you know so that's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.790 
just edgy one or two you know so that's
why<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.690> think<00:03:15.780> Bella<00:03:16.170> rain<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> good<00:03:16.500> option

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
why I think Bella rain is a good option

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.640 
why I think Bella rain is a good option
once<00:03:17.130> again<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:19.019> let's<00:03:19.230> take<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.440> look<00:03:19.590> at

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
once again so now let's take a look at

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.590 
once again so now let's take a look at
the<00:03:19.769> changes<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> FPS<00:03:20.730> its<00:03:20.910> dream<00:03:21.180> team<00:03:21.390> as

the changes to the FPS its dream team as

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.280 
the changes to the FPS its dream team as
