 television chain more also the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.269
 that never 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 a year ago in November 2012 it was made 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.480
 a live disc of reik in the auditorium 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.370
 national when it was the first time 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.009
 that they were in this room on 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.410
 reform colossus that is there is a job 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.180
 well well very big that had to be 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.279
 obviously doing for us 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 but of all the team that is behind 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.360
 they do not see there on camera but it is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.950
 a very big effort and it fills us with 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.259
 proud to be able to say that we fill it 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.969
 twice and we are about to arrive 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.009
 third and what father can share it 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.690
 with all our audience to see that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.690
 see that beautiful moment in our 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.179
 lives and that emotional show not to see 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.000
 to start a lot of happiness from our 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.640
 part we are not like this 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.770
 very very excited also like that is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.900
 very very sentimental also out there 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.130
 suddenly because there are words to someone 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.410
 behind cameras out there then 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.960
 we who think the race how 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 we come to images by your family of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 the managers to see the people singing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.030
 unbelievable lung if it is if it is a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 super emotional moment many times 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.680
 even overflowing because 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.820
 you feel that you can not contain from the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.060
 grenadine of the summer motion 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.800
 to the gigantic public if in the auditorium 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.720
 that is from from the people that you see 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.729
 perfectly well to those who are there 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.950
 just like with hands up and 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.530
 lights and the whole roll if if all 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.270
 a show not just this one for the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.369
 public but for us also not 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.990
 we know what happens when you go super 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.910
 super super good and we are enjoying 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 of this moment for example that I believe 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.350
 which is professionally the best 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.670
 our lives certainly water never 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.650
 we had had more concerts more 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.869
 discs sold more so much tata tata 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.500
 theater these things but we also know 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.539
 that if it does not happen and you did not get up, it took off 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.460
 it's the dust you make another disk 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.310
 we brought them with disks, I'm not 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.720
 that thing of abuse but we would like 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.160
 give it to you one of the people who 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.869
 is doing us in favor of seeing all the 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.270
 family of our day does not confirm it 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.890
 so that there is evidence and that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.390
 do not leave a mark that you do not like 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.610
 know in the national live audience 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.039
 recorded last year and now they go for the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.079
 rematch on June 4 because 7 14 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.740
