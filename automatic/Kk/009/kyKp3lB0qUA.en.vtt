00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.830
 here we go with our second video 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.740
 on how to do 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.200
 hexagons here we already have 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.280
 sides 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.280
 so we take it 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.639
 let's finish this round 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.300
 let's finish in this chain 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.079
 here we finish and we 're going to 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.140
 hiding the thread down here from below 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.899
 we advance 1 point 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 and we keep hiding it to go out in 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.500
 this little hole 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.480
 here we are going to raise the same as how 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.610
 we go in this little corner three massifs two 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.070
 chains and three beds 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.070
 we go with the first group of massifs 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.720
 two 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.559
 3 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.559
 two chains 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.479
 one again 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.440
 we are not going to have any chain of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.130
 separation we are leaving so now here there 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.760
 another little hole we will do the same 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.530
 three massifs nothing more 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.100
 or not 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.100
 two 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.130
 and 3 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.900
 here is going to be simple because 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.750
 nothing else in the corners where this 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 corner is where three beds will go 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.909
 two chains three massifs and where you see 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.710
 the hole there we will put nothing else 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.840
 a group of three 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.299
 let's continue here this is another 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.890
 corner here let's make three two 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.890
 chains and three other clumps 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.300
 subscribe be weaving mexico so that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.910
 they reach them 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.240
 as a scoop the videos that we are going to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.240
 put 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.540
 three others 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.740
 you can return the video so many times 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.590
 as you want so you do not get lost in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.230
 none of the steps here end 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.510
 this other corner here comes a little hole 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.060
 only this hole tells us when not 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.080
 this corner is that the group is simple 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.080
 of three beds 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 without separation chain remember 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.700
 only when you ski in the fabric is 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.550
 when we must emphasize 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.000
 what are two groups of three suitcases or 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.400
 massifs 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.510
 here we finish another corner like this 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.510
 taking the shape of a hexagon 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.489
 here we have a hole is simple here 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.489
 are the three clumps 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.150
 we go in chain of separation here 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.150
 there is another corner 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.970
 12 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.230
 three beds 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.180
 two chains 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.180
 three other beds 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.540
 again it's a simple group of three 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.540
 variants nothing more 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.390
 we have a corner 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.240
 two separation chains 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.920
 this are 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.940
 and the freshest 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.940
 for cotton 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.999
 by the way it's called symphony 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.310
 and we're knitting it with a hook from 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.310
 3 and a half 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.190
 here we are going to finish the third round 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.430
 here we are finished, we are going to launch the 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.320
 third chain of the first massif 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.390
 following 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.870
 and we close with slipped point 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:00.550
 can appreciate how it goes here is the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.680
 hexagon we 're going to go we have 1 2 3 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.480
 for the back door is where we're going 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.660
 to increase with a separation chain 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.960
 among the groups of massifs here we 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.449
 we are hiding and we are already here 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.529
 this corner 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.529
 let's go up 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.900
 with three and as that corner remember 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.330
 that are three chains two chains of 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.330
 separation and three clumps 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.830
 let's do the second 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.490
 the third and a separation chain 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.870
 we go with this group that this little group is 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.870
 simple 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.720
 a separation chain 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.840
 and now that it shows us that it is simple 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.030
 group is also not corner then it is 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.020
 single 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.020
 a group 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.670
 see you in the next video for 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:20.520
 teach them how it will be the hexagon 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.520
