00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
then the Hulkbuster again has I think to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.479 
then the Hulkbuster again has I think to
put<00:02:46.500> maybe<00:02:46.650> three<00:02:46.950> points<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.340> articulation

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
put maybe three points of articulation

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.130 
put maybe three points of articulation
he's<00:02:48.090> got<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.599> arms

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
he's got the arms

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.760 
he's got the arms
move<00:02:49.880> does<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> head<00:02:51.180> turn<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.319> head<00:02:52.530> does

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
move does the head turn the head does

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.670 
move does the head turn the head does
not<00:02:52.800> appear<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.430> turn<00:02:54.319> yeah<00:02:55.319> I'm<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:55.500> going<00:02:55.590> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
not appear to turn yeah I'm not going to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.020 
not appear to turn yeah I'm not going to
force<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.100> he's<00:02:56.250> got<00:02:56.400> two<00:02:56.610> points<00:02:56.940> of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
force it so he's got two points of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.010 
force it so he's got two points of
articulation<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.630> looks<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.990> should

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
articulation it looks like it should

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.360 
articulation it looks like it should
looks<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> head<00:02:58.770> is<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> separate<00:02:59.250> piece

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
looks like the head is a separate piece

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.760 
looks like the head is a separate piece
and<00:02:59.580> should<00:02:59.819> turn<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.930> oh<00:03:01.170> well<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:01.650> not

and should turn but oh well I'm not
going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> force<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.660> rest<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.900> his

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
going to force it and the rest of his

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.260 
going to force it and the rest of his
body<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.530> solid<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.880> may<00:03:06.060> seem

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
is not this one so that was six dollars

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
is not this one so that was six dollars
that<00:04:29.490> was<00:04:29.610> over<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> dollar<00:04:30.330> per<00:04:30.690> point<00:04:30.870> of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
that was over a dollar per point of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.240 
that was over a dollar per point of
articulation<00:04:32.150> on<00:04:33.150> this<00:04:33.390> guy<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.950> see<00:04:35.130> it's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
articulation on this guy you see it's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.880 
articulation on this guy you see it's
it's<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.970> mark<00:04:36.180> 43<00:04:36.780> armor<00:04:37.110> from<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.380> movie<00:04:37.680> is

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
it's the mark 43 armor from the movie is

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.690 
it's the mark 43 armor from the movie is
basically<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.460> mark<00:04:38.640> 42<00:04:39.860> visually<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.490> more

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
basically the mark 42 visually it's more

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.130 
basically the mark 42 visually it's more
or<00:04:41.760> less<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.000> mark<00:04:42.180> 42<00:04:42.570> with<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> reversed

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
or less the mark 42 with a reversed

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.570 
or less the mark 42 with a reversed
color<00:04:43.380> scheme<00:04:43.680> like<00:04:43.830> where<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.070> Reds<00:04:44.280> gold

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
color scheme like where the Reds gold

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.790 
color scheme like where the Reds gold
and<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.850> gold<00:04:45.030> is<00:04:45.180> red<00:04:45.600> ass<00:04:46.169> whopped

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
and the gold is red ass whopped

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.080 
and the gold is red ass whopped
which<00:04:47.220> basically<00:04:47.490> means<00:04:47.760> they<00:04:47.940> could

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
which basically means they could

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.700 
which basically means they could
actually<00:04:48.210> use<00:04:48.479> less<00:04:48.690> gold<00:04:48.960> paint<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.380> can<00:04:49.410> mold

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
actually use less gold paint I can mold

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.380 
actually use less gold paint I can mold
it<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:49.860> red<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.220> use<00:04:50.400> less<00:04:50.700> gold<00:04:50.970> paint<00:04:51.210> apps

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
it in red and use less gold paint apps

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.719 
it in red and use less gold paint apps
on<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:53.720> man<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:55.070> was<00:04:56.070> all<00:04:56.160> excited<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.610> was

and<00:05:26.759> this<00:05:27.300> one<00:05:27.419> is<00:05:27.509> still<00:05:27.599> cool<00:05:27.870> for<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.139> Hulk

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319

and this one is still cool for the Hulk
in<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.500> Hulkbuster<00:05:28.979> although<00:05:29.310> it<00:05:29.400> would<00:05:29.490> have

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
in the Hulkbuster although it would have

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.990 
in the Hulkbuster although it would have
been<00:05:29.699> worth<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.449> 16<00:05:30.930> bucks<00:05:31.169> if<00:05:32.129> Iron<00:05:32.460> Man<00:05:32.699> fit

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
been worth of 16 bucks if Iron Man fit

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.879 
been worth of 16 bucks if Iron Man fit
inside<00:05:33.300> there<00:05:33.539> man<00:05:33.960> because<00:05:34.560> it<00:05:34.680> looked<00:05:34.860> like

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
inside there man because it looked like

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.200 
inside there man because it looked like
it<00:05:35.099> looked<00:05:35.159> like<00:05:35.340> it'd<00:05:35.460> be<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> tight<00:05:35.819> fit<00:05:36.090> but

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
it looked like it'd be a tight fit but

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.399 
it looked like it'd be a tight fit but
look<00:05:36.360> like<00:05:36.509> if<00:05:36.629> you<00:05:36.659> could<00:05:36.750> squeeze<00:05:37.169> him<00:05:37.319> in

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
look like if you could squeeze him in

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.899 
look like if you could squeeze him in
like<00:05:37.560> if<00:05:37.889> you<00:05:37.979> get<00:05:38.129> his<00:05:38.250> feet<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.610> there<00:05:38.789> you

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
like if you get his feet in there you

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:39.920 
like if you get his feet in there you
know<00:05:39.030> you'd<00:05:39.150> spread<00:05:39.330> his<00:05:39.479> legs<00:05:39.659> out<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.870> little

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
know you'd spread his legs out a little

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.360 
know you'd spread his legs out a little
bit<00:05:40.229> but<00:05:40.409> looks<00:05:40.560> like<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.770> could<00:05:40.860> conceivably

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
bit but looks like you could conceivably

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.149 
bit but looks like you could conceivably
fit<00:05:41.759> him<00:05:41.879> inside<00:05:42.210> that<00:05:42.240> plastic<00:05:42.840> ah<00:05:45.110> well<00:05:46.159> so

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
fit him inside that plastic ah well so

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.980 
fit him inside that plastic ah well so
yeah<00:05:47.280> so<00:05:47.460> there's<00:05:47.610> Hulkbuster<00:05:48.150> with<00:05:48.900> his

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990
