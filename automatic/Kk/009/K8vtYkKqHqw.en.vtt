 Argentines the association of watercolorists 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.600
 Argentines who can see us behind me 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.879
 and right now we're not going to the workshop that 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.460
 is waiting for godfroid món in the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.189
 space of eternal and also tell me 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.680
 we go there eternal space with 

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:59.290
 monica godfroid and today with a lot of work 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.239
 and many new money how are you good 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.180
 very well have to know today 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.820
 today I brought a face of a woman 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.500
 African very beautiful to my judgments 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 prices 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.570
 then we will work with the technique 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.940
 of the dry brush for this technique I 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.670
 that I use are brushes 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.730
 of hair not of hair but of bristle 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.220
 white really hard yes and I will work with 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.650
 all colors lands the shadow 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.380
 toasted the sienna toasted the siena 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.900
 natural and white to clarify the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.910
 signature to the obviously acrylics of 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.770
 eternal 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.640
 then look at a black base that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.070
 I already di worked first with dry brush 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.890
 with the earth color of toasted shadow and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 what I saw was a base let's say to this 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.980
 black face to this face of this black 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.020
 leaving some shadows in black by 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.260
 example in the nose I loved the nose 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.090
 because they tend to damage and good 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.220
 then for me then look now 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.830
 I will work with the brush with the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.229
 land of the siena toast and what I do 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.240
 is to load the brush and download it a lot 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.520
 helps me a lot from these trays of 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080
 telgopor because you see I can download 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.570
 enough here 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.270
 maybe the amount I use very little 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.030
 painting almost nothing almost nothing and the brush 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.870
 dry what you are doing with this 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.209
 technique 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.150
 perfect everything that are coats 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.180
 also of animals the hair animals 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:37.720
 short also this technique is very useful and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.629
 good and the skins also yes yes no no 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.659
 not because it's a super simple technique 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.970
 look at the dry brush what it does is 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.640
 this I'm going up or I'm going 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.489
 clarifying if I'm using colors every time 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.890
 clearer and what I'm doing is the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.160
 surface that I'm clarifying always goes 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.280
 to be smaller than the surface that I made 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.250
 earlier I want to say this the nose 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.560
 for example is I worked all this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.349
 part of the nose with the toasted shade 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.780
 and what I'm going to paint now with siena 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.989
 toast is going to be smaller then there I go 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.379
 raising the volume I hope to make clear 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.409
 that spaces are understood more 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.349
 minors is more giving it volume and only 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.940
 exactly lifting the ones with colors 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.270
 lighter and with more surfaces 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.460
 small then there I go with this 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:39.390
 that it would be 100 to roast and look there 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.390
 this nose and nose are already assembling 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.980
 I always leave the black and there is the shadow 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.290
 Toast clean my brush and with the same 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.930
 brush I'm going to take the sienna stone 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.830
 natural that is a much lighter color 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.850
 yes and I'm working with acrylics 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.740
 decorative of eternal 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.470
 and there I 'm going to work, I 'm going to raise this 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.760
 volume with the natural siena I think that 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.640
 there you can see 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.739
 if I can put up a little more 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.870
 shadows and need to apply you can 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.720
 let rest and then return to 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.790
 perform some total light totally 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.769
 is that the work is always done 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.959
 I say step by step then you go 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.350
 working and you are seeing what is going 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:30.270
 happening in your project like that there we go 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.210
 forming this analysis of this woman I 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.090
 I go after I go back to the nose I'm going to 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.550
 what is opposite already has the land of 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.220
 shadow toast now I'm going to work with 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.440
 time goes from 100 to toast then I'm going 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.100
 to lift look that you will receive more 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.570
 light in the center of that forehead 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.150
 so what I'm going to do is 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.550
 lift and I'm using the brush as 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.460
 if it were a color pencil without notice 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.050
 that the brushstroke is leaving painting 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.050
 if very little 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.130
 look like the little noise that makes my 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.730
 brush yes and it's like painting with a 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.910
 pencil 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.210
 then I'm raising the light here in the 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.740
 front and I do not want that we passed the 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.620
 block because you have something to 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.910
 worry if I already present it to you but 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.460
 good 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.860
 In short, it would be to raise 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.290
 lighter areas with lighter colors 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.930
 yes and in another opportunity we can 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.790
 work the eyes because I do not want 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.600
 discard the eyes is a special class 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.370
 yes and I do not want to miss the moment of 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.920
 present to them what for eternal is a 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.140
 pride and for many of those who 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.000
 they worked and we worked in some way 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.610
 in this magazine it really is a pride 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.290

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.820
