my<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:19.020> answer<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.490> first<00:00:20.670> part<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
my first answer my the first part of the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.420 
my first answer my the first part of the
answer<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> mix<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.769> don't<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.189> be

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
answer is mix it up you don't have to be

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
answer is mix it up you don't have to be
exclusive<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> use<00:00:24.660> only<00:00:25.019> harbor<00:00:25.740> Barry

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
exclusive and use only harbor Barry

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
exclusive and use only harbor Barry
Harris<00:00:26.400> harmonic<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.170> stuff

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
Harris harmonic you can use this stuff

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.189 
Harris harmonic you can use this stuff
you<00:00:28.500> already<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.340> mix<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.359> match<00:00:30.420> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you already know and mix and match so

here<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.180> worked<00:00:33.180> out<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> little<00:00:33.600> thing

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
here it is I worked out a little thing

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
here it is I worked out a little thing
on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> first<00:00:34.380> eight<00:00:34.530> bars<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:35.180> out<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
on the first eight bars of out of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.080 
on the first eight bars of out of
nowhere<00:00:37.010> I'll<00:00:38.010> play<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.309> once<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
nowhere I'll play it once for you and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
nowhere I'll play it once for you and
explain<00:00:39.210> chord<00:00:39.809> by<00:00:39.960> chord<00:00:39.989> after<00:00:41.149> one<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
explain chord by chord after one two a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:01:04.630 
explain chord by chord after one two a
one<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.160> three<00:00:44.879> four

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.390 

so<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:06.060> court<00:01:06.300> I<00:01:06.390> used<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.920> full<00:01:08.160> bar

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
so first court I used was a one full bar

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.830 
so first court I used was a one full bar
of<00:01:08.520> G<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.840> G<00:01:10.080> six<00:01:12.080> as<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> drop<00:01:13.560> three<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of G here G six as a drop three then the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.180 
of G here G six as a drop three then the
the<00:01:16.260> bar<00:01:16.410> after<00:01:16.800> I<00:01:17.510> played<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:19.080> scale<00:01:19.350> going

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
the bar after I played the scale going

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.080 
the bar after I played the scale going
up<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:21.120> ma<00:01:21.540> diminished<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> first<00:01:23.940> two

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
up that's ma diminished so first two

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.650 
up that's ma diminished so first two
bars<00:01:24.300> one<00:01:24.660> two<00:01:25.140> three<00:01:25.710> four<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.730> two<00:01:27.150> three

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
bars one two three four one two three

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.690 
bars one two three four one two three
four<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.920> two<00:01:29.370> three<00:01:29.700> four<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:32.400> court

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
four one two three four and this court

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.900 
four one two three four and this court
instead<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.120> being<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.200> usual<00:01:34.410> inversion<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:46.190 

changed<00:01:38.910> one<00:01:39.210> note<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:44.690> it's<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.750> beautiful

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
changed one note here it's a beautiful

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.900 
changed one note here it's a beautiful
sound<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> goes<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.510> this<00:01:49.340> two<00:01:50.340> three

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
sound so it goes like this two three

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.770 
sound so it goes like this two three
four<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.960> two<00:01:52.380> three<00:01:52.710> four<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.940> then<00:01:54.510> in

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
four one two three four and then in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
four one two three four and then in
order<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.080> get<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.650> other<00:01:56.460> cord<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> b-flat

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
order to get to the other cord to b-flat

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
order to get to the other cord to b-flat
minor<00:01:57.690> seven<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.740> chord<00:01:59.070> shape

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.800 
minor seven which is a chord shape
everyone<00:01:59.880> knows<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:03.090> decided<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.690> use

Barry<00:02:04.259> Harris<00:02:04.729> diminished<00:02:05.729> thing<00:02:05.910> so<00:02:06.720> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
Barry Harris diminished thing so I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.729 
Barry Harris diminished thing so I
started<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.440> an<00:02:07.560> F<00:02:07.970> minor<00:02:08.970> seven<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.200> C

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
started with an F minor seven with the C

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.150 
started with an F minor seven with the C
in<00:02:10.980> the<00:02:11.100> root<00:02:12.320> play<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.380> diminish<00:02:13.830> passing

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
in the root play the diminish passing

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.850 
in the root play the diminish passing
tongue<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.030> got<00:02:15.269> there<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.900> sounded<00:02:16.830> like

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
tongue and got there so it sounded like

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.979 
tongue and got there so it sounded like
this<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:22.080> first<00:02:22.739> four<00:02:23.459> bars<00:02:23.670> one<00:02:23.970> two<00:02:24.450> three

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
this so first four bars one two three

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.280 
this so first four bars one two three
