00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.600
 VERSION 6: NEW VILLAGE 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 BECAME THE ARCHITECT OF YOUR DANGER 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.800
 MONY DOCHEV - CEO OF IMPERIA ONLINE Each player will have the opportunity to personalize his village in accordance with his perception and taste. 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.500
 Users will have the opportunity to build their medieval villages by choosing from different types of buildings. 

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:28.850
 So they can modify the latest village view, according to their preferences. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.700
 They will feel at home in their empire. 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.850
 In this way we will be able to create the effect of entry 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 not just in a game account, but in a unique virtual space for each player. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600
 EFFECTS WAOW! 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.200
 This will be the most noticeable change for the user to be immediately noticed. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.600
 We have prepared a considerable number of modules that will spur 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.360
 evaluation after a few months of constant playing the game. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 The village is the first thing players encounter in the game 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.570
 and hopefully will provide waow effect! immediately. 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.600
 BLOOD, DJERS AND LOTS 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.100
 PETKO SEYMENAROV - HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT In keeping with the fact that with the naming of the village is connected the entire package of new construction machinery, 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.450
 the ability to make buildings freely on the village map and the user interface, 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 the village in full is in the top 3 of the greatest functionalities in the game. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.760
 From this point of view, it requires hard work to accomplish. 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 Among the most difficult tasks was the development of 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.600
 a new concept of shingles, and the opportunity to settle at will, 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.030
 in the village, the choice of different styles. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 Another very difficult task for us was the shift to the full screen, 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.060
 namely the development of necessary menus and images. 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.600
 LOOKING TO THE TEAM 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.700
 The easiest part is when working with people who have the will and the ability to reach 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
 final results and do their best to do that. 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.500
 That is why teams at Imperia Online Ltd are constantly striving to achieve the goal, 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.660
 exactly what players get the right satisfaction from the game, 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.860
 as we gain, during its development. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 improvisation 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.960
 Programming such a module certainly leaves space 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 for innovation and new initiatives. 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 We had to make certain selections, related to the flash environment - 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.600
 visuals with which players interact 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.700
 and where is the village. We had some minor problems there 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.400
 which we overcame with our solutions. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 GREAT DESIGN 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.600
 TODOR IGNATOV - HEAD OF ART TEAM I dare say it will be, very, very impressive. 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.300
 We have prepared a number of completely new buildings 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.200
 such as castles, governor offices, headquarters, streets, 

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:12.500
 many decorations and monuments (fountains, canals, statues, etc.). 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.450
 The novelty is that the construction phases will be visible. 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.650
 I would like to emphasize here the variations 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.670
 only for the castle are more than 70. This is just for the Castles. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920
 For the strongholds, I mean. 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.940
 The whole department of Art was looking after creation 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.320
 of hundreds of concepts of medieval buildings. We chose the most convenient style. 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.650
 It took more than 2 months hard work. After that we formed teams of 3 members, 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.850
 who should develop the village concept for Version 6. 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.100
 Within a 6-month period we created over 400 different buildings. 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.600
 A NEW WAY OF THOUGHT 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.100
 The main challenge our artists faced was that they should change their way of thinking - 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.400
 because in the isometric graph there is no prospect. 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.500
 The scale of paintings also caused us some difficulties. 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.000
 They should be small but with specific details. 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.660
 This was quite difficult and required much effort. 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.670
 At first the teams did not have the proper knowledge 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.100
 but gradually gained the necessary skills. 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.600
 THE LEADS FOR THE KALORASI 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.250
 HRISTO HRISTOV - COMPOSITOR / AUDIO DESIGN Because Imperia Online is played all over the world 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
 and is an extremely diverse game, provides the dream platform 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.580
 for the performance of each composer's career. 

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:57.600
 First, because his music will be heard all over the planet, and secondly, because he can use all his skills. 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.800
 Music for version 6 will be adaptive. 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.700
 It will change along with the state of the domains 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.700
 and with the realization of important events. 

00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:12.100
 Luckily, I work with people who trust me 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.015
 and the chances to convey different moments and atmospheres are almost infinite. 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.670
 Of course, there are times, for example the preparation of the game trailer, 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.970
 where there are boundaries depending on the length, 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.170
 synchrony and the overall concept of video. Then we have to consider it all. 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.000
 However, when working with a professional team and having good communication, 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.400
 the borders break quickly. 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.200
 Dreams, Realization, Perfectionism and Life 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.240
 We wrote all sorts of music sounds that could describe all the possible situations in the game. 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.200
 The main purpose was to create a pulsating music. 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.760
 The new Imperia Online Village is a dream come true for me. 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.270
 So far, we've achieved everything we wanted. 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.290
 We do not risk damaging the quality. Never. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.900
 NEW VILLAGE WINNERS ON SEPTEMBER 2013.
