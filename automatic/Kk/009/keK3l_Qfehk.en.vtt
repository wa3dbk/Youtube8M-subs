00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.550 

hi<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.880> name<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.089> Laura<00:00:24.390> Alford<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:25.439> I'd

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
hi my name is Laura Alford and now I'd

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.079 
hi my name is Laura Alford and now I'd
like<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> introduce<00:00:26.039> some<00:00:26.400> concepts<00:00:26.910> around

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
like to introduce some concepts around

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.359 
like to introduce some concepts around
damage<00:00:27.810> stability<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.619> we've<00:00:28.800> been<00:00:28.919> talking

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
damage stability so we've been talking

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.210 
damage stability so we've been talking
about<00:00:29.460> stability<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.839> GM<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.320> GZ<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.130> all

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
about stability with GM and GZ and all

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.029 
about stability with GM and GZ and all
these<00:00:32.340> numbers<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.820> letters<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> such<00:00:34.289> that

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
these numbers and letters and such that

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.310 
these numbers and letters and such that
all<00:00:35.160> had<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.579> intech<00:00:36.090> stability<00:00:36.629> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
all had to do with intech stability so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
all had to do with intech stability so
that<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.590> looked<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.760> about<00:00:39.090> how

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that we looked at a little bit about how

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
that we looked at a little bit about how
to<00:00:39.359> some<00:00:39.629> tricky<00:00:39.930> loading<00:00:40.199> conditions<00:00:40.680> now

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
to some tricky loading conditions now

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.590 
to some tricky loading conditions now
what<00:00:41.280> happens<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> ship<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> actually

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
what happens at the ship is actually

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.650 
what happens at the ship is actually
damaged<00:00:43.050> what's<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> happen

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
damaged what's going to happen

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.319 
damaged what's going to happen
so<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:46.199> general<00:00:46.649> ships<00:00:47.309> usually<00:00:47.519> get<00:00:47.940> damaged

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so in general ships usually get damaged

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.349 
so in general ships usually get damaged
because<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> operator<00:00:49.350> errors<00:00:49.969> we<00:00:50.969> don't

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
because of operator errors we don't

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.200 
because of operator errors we don't
maintain<00:00:51.510> them<00:00:51.780> properly<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.640> many

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
maintain them properly we take many

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.299 
maintain them properly we take many
errors<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.230> lead<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> collisions<00:00:56.129> right

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
errors that lead to collisions right

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
errors that lead to collisions right
like<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.609> one<00:00:57.000> ship<00:00:57.239> running<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:57.750> another

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
like it one ship running into another

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
like it one ship running into another
isn't<00:00:58.170> because<00:00:58.620> somebody<00:00:59.219> took<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.640> wrong

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
isn't because somebody took one wrong

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
isn't because somebody took one wrong
turn<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.660> many<00:01:01.199> things<00:01:01.530> went<00:01:01.739> wrong

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
turn it's because many things went wrong

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
turn it's because many things went wrong
all<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> row<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.359> things<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
all in a row and the things that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
all in a row and the things that
compounded<00:01:04.350> though<00:01:05.280> sometimes<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.420> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
compounded though sometimes it just is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.150 
compounded though sometimes it just is
out<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.870> our<00:01:07.080> hands<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.530> ship<00:01:07.770> somehow

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
out of our hands right a ship somehow

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.440 
out of our hands right a ship somehow
gets<00:01:08.340> caught<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:08.730> a<00:01:08.820> storm<00:01:09.120> or<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> hurricane

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
gets caught in a storm or a hurricane

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.640 
gets caught in a storm or a hurricane
and<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.560> does<00:01:10.770> happen<00:01:10.980> so<00:01:11.730> we<00:01:12.000> need<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.650> keep

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and it does happen so we need to keep

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
and it does happen so we need to keep
that<00:01:13.800> in<00:01:13.950> mind<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> design

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that in mind and we need to design

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
that in mind and we need to design
around<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> try<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.260> sure<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> our

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
around it and try and make sure that our

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.540 
around it and try and make sure that our
ships<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.160> as<00:01:17.370> safe<00:01:17.550> as<00:01:17.700> possible<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> when

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
ships can be as safe as possible so when

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.820 
ships can be as safe as possible so when
the<00:01:20.730> ship<00:01:20.940> is<00:01:21.060> damaged<00:01:21.510> what<00:01:21.990> happens<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.680> its

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the ship is damaged what happens to its

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.480 
the ship is damaged what happens to its
stability<00:01:23.370> right<00:01:23.730> um<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:25.350> ways<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.190> it<00:01:26.310> can

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
stability right um some ways that it can

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
stability right um some ways that it can
sink<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> them<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> foundering<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sink one of them is foundering so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
sink one of them is foundering so
foundering<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.970> run<00:01:30.330> over<00:01:30.510> something<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
foundering is you run over something and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.930 
foundering is you run over something and
you<00:01:31.470> damage<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.950> bottom<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> hull<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
you damage the bottom of the hull and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.030 
you damage the bottom of the hull and
the<00:01:33.480> hull<00:01:33.630> starts<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> boat<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.620> ship<00:01:34.800> starts

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the hull starts the boat the ship starts

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
the hull starts the boat the ship starts
to<00:01:35.130> fill<00:01:35.370> with<00:01:35.580> water<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> floods<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.660> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to fill with water and it floods and the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
to fill with water and it floods and the
floods<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.740> floods<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.850> point<00:01:39.090> where

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
floods and the floods to the point where

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.360 
floods and the floods to the point where
weight<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.170> greater<00:01:40.440> than<00:01:40.530> buoyancy<00:01:41.160> and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
weight is now greater than buoyancy and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.490 
weight is now greater than buoyancy and
the<00:01:41.460> ship<00:01:41.790> sinks<00:01:42.180> you'll<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> ship

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the ship sinks you'll see here the ship

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
the ship sinks you'll see here the ship
has<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.710> sunk<00:01:44.130> straight<00:01:44.550> down<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.120> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
has just sunk straight down right so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.670 
has just sunk straight down right so
this<00:01:45.510> is<00:01:45.570> different<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:46.170> some<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> other

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
this is different from some of the other

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.590 
this is different from some of the other
ways<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:47.040> sinking<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.210> healed

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
ways of sinking where it's not healed

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.400 
ways of sinking where it's not healed
over<00:01:49.080> at<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:50.900> capsizing<00:01:51.900> we<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.170> talked

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
over at all capsizing we have talked

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.440 
over at all capsizing we have talked
about<00:01:52.650> before<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.150> initial

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
about before with with the initial

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.260 
about before with with the initial
stability<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.340> capsize<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.640> when<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> ship

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
stability right capsize is when the ship

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 
stability right capsize is when the ship
heels<00:01:57.540> over<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.260> much<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> does<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.370> have

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
heels over so much that it does not have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
heels over so much that it does not have
a<00:01:59.910> righting<00:02:00.300> moment<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:01.020> bring<00:02:01.410> itself<00:02:01.680> back

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
a righting moment to bring itself back

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
a righting moment to bring itself back
up<00:02:01.920> right<00:02:02.220> again<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:02.730> recent<00:02:03.630> example<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.080> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
up right again a recent example of this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
up right again a recent example of this
was<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.530> Costa<00:02:04.830> Concordia<00:02:04.860> which<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> might

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
was the Costa Concordia which you might

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.789 
was the Costa Concordia which you might
remember<00:02:08.030> when<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.329> last<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.679> I'm

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
remember when the last way here that I'm

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.410 
remember when the last way here that I'm
going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> talk<00:02:11.129> about<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.519> plunging<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
going to talk about is plunging so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
going to talk about is plunging so
plunging<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.930> when<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
plunging is when this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
plunging is when this
front<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.220> your<00:02:14.400> ship<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.819> damaged<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> bow

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
front of your ship is damaged the bow

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
front of your ship is damaged the bow
and<00:02:15.870> flooding<00:02:16.860> begins<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> bow<00:02:17.610> it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and flooding begins in the bow it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.280 
and flooding begins in the bow it
spreads<00:02:18.180> from<00:02:18.270> there<00:02:18.569> right<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.170> bow

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
spreads from there right so the bow

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
spreads from there right so the bow
sinks<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.099> sinks<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.060> sinks<00:02:21.450> some<00:02:21.540> more

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
sinks and sinks and sinks some more

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.660 
sinks and sinks and sinks some more
until<00:02:22.020> finally<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.500> plunges<00:02:23.010> below<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
until finally it plunges below the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.460 
until finally it plunges below the
surface<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> water<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.959> sinks<00:02:25.319> very

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
surface of the water and it sinks very

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770 
surface of the water and it sinks very
famous<00:02:26.400> example<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.390> Titanic

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
famous example this is the Titanic

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.510 
famous example this is the Titanic
that's<00:02:28.170> how<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.590> sunk<00:02:30.350> all<00:02:31.350> right<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.800> your

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
that's how it sunk all right so your

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.430 
that's how it sunk all right so your
ship<00:02:32.700> has<00:02:32.819> become<00:02:33.000> damaged<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
ship has become damaged it's going to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
ship has become damaged it's going to
flood<00:02:34.680> what<00:02:35.100> are<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.340> effects<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
flood what are the effects of that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.440 
flood what are the effects of that
flooding<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.650> recall<00:02:37.980> GM<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.090> our<00:02:39.239> measure

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
flooding if you recall GM is our measure

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.449 
flooding if you recall GM is our measure
of<00:02:39.540> initial<00:02:39.989> stability<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:41.040> order<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> get

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
of initial stability and in order to get

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.400 
of initial stability and in order to get
GM<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.850> have<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> calculate<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.840> length<00:02:42.959> BM

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
GM you have to calculate the length BM

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.699 
GM you have to calculate the length BM
BM<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.489> calculated<00:02:45.060> by<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.630> second<00:02:46.319> moment<00:02:46.650> of

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
BM is calculated by the second moment of

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.229 
BM is calculated by the second moment of
the<00:02:46.920> water<00:02:47.130> plane<00:02:47.310> area<00:02:47.370> about<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
the water plane area about the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.330 
the water plane area about the
centerline<00:02:48.660> divided<00:02:49.260> by<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.470> underwater

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
centerline divided by the underwater

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.800 
centerline divided by the underwater
volume<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> ship<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.360> those<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.660> are

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
volume of the ship so those two are

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
volume of the ship so those two are
shown<00:02:52.049> here<00:02:53.330> when<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> ship<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.720> damaged<00:02:55.200> you

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
shown here when the ship is damaged you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.770 
shown here when the ship is damaged you
lose<00:02:56.160> some<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:56.970> original<00:02:57.150> underwater

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
lose some of your original underwater

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.900 
lose some of your original underwater
volume<00:02:58.440> due<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.950> flooding<00:02:59.220> but<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.580> lost

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
volume due to the flooding but it's lost

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.620 
volume due to the flooding but it's lost
buoyancy

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
buoyancy

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.840 
buoyancy
similarly<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.980> lose<00:03:02.190> some<00:03:02.400> water<00:03:02.580> plane<00:03:02.819> area

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
similarly you lose some water plane area

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.590 
similarly you lose some water plane area
also<00:03:03.480> due<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.200> due<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.069> flooding<00:03:05.600> the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
also due to this due to the flooding the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.630 
also due to this due to the flooding the
ship<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> sink<00:03:07.350> which<00:03:08.220> means<00:03:08.489> that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
ship is going to sink which means that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
ship is going to sink which means that
the<00:03:08.790> draft<00:03:09.060> will<00:03:09.239> increase<00:03:09.840> until<00:03:10.080> all<00:03:10.620> of

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
the draft will increase until all of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.190 
the draft will increase until all of
that<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.430> lost<00:03:11.790> underwater<00:03:12.600> volume<00:03:13.110> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
that the lost underwater volume is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.809 
that the lost underwater volume is
regained<00:03:13.650> elsewhere<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:14.459> you've<00:03:14.670> got<00:03:14.700> a

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
regained elsewhere so now you've got a

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.160 
regained elsewhere so now you've got a
higher<00:03:15.030> draft<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.600> you're<00:03:15.750> still<00:03:15.930> missing

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
higher draft but you're still missing

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.780 
higher draft but you're still missing
that<00:03:16.410> buoyancy<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.190> bit<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.580> middle

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
that buoyancy in the bit in the middle

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.500 
that buoyancy in the bit in the middle
there<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.400> have<00:03:20.579> new<00:03:20.940> underwater

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
there so now you have new underwater

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.509 
there so now you have new underwater
volume<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:22.170> equals<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.859> old<00:03:23.040> underwater

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
volume it equals the old underwater

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.250 
volume it equals the old underwater
volume<00:03:23.850> but<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> shape<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.480> very<00:03:24.750> different

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
volume but the shape is very different

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.000 
volume but the shape is very different
right<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:28.140> center<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.500> buoyancy<00:03:28.680> has

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
right so the the center of buoyancy has

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.590 
right so the the center of buoyancy has
increased<00:03:29.549> because<00:03:29.700> draft<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.180> increased

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
increased because draft is increased

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.229 
increased because draft is increased
which<00:03:30.810> means<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.260> KB<00:03:31.739> has<00:03:32.010> increased<00:03:32.459> you

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
which means that KB has increased you

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.410 
which means that KB has increased you
have<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.720> new<00:03:34.350> center<00:03:35.190> line<00:03:35.430> water<00:03:36.150> plane<00:03:36.390> area

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
have a new center line water plane area

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.210 
have a new center line water plane area
that's<00:03:37.049> less<00:03:37.290> than<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.530> old<00:03:37.739> water<00:03:37.980> plane

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
that's less than the old water plane

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400 
that's less than the old water plane
area<00:03:38.250> because<00:03:38.940> assuming<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.989> flooding<00:03:40.290> is

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
area because assuming the flooding is

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.310 
area because assuming the flooding is
contained<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.180> water<00:03:42.600> plane<00:03:42.840> area<00:03:42.870> isn't

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.140 
contained the the water plane area isn't
going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> change<00:03:43.620> radically<00:03:44.070> apart<00:03:44.970> from

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
going to change radically apart from

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.490 
going to change radically apart from

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
that part that's missing due to the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.400 
that part that's missing due to the

flooded section as a result of all that
your<00:03:49.829> draft<00:03:50.160> will<00:03:50.370> change<00:03:50.609> your<00:03:51.000> trim<00:03:51.299> will

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
your draft will change your trim will

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.090 
your draft will change your trim will
change<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.260> transverse<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:52.980> longitudinal

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
change the transverse and longitudinal

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.280 
change the transverse and longitudinal
BM<00:03:53.850> dimensions<00:03:54.510> will<00:03:54.630> change<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.140> also<00:03:55.260> he'll

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
BM dimensions will change and also he'll

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.270 
BM dimensions will change and also he'll
with<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> change<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.859> water<00:03:59.010> plane<00:03:59.250> area

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
with the change in the water plane area

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.569 
with the change in the water plane area
that<00:04:00.060> will<00:04:00.390> decrease<00:04:01.079> your<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:02.250> second

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
that will decrease your the second

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.280 
that will decrease your the second
moment<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.450> about<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.810> centerline

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
moment of it about the centerline

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.710 
moment of it about the centerline
because<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.459> then<00:04:05.760> BM<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:06.269> decrease

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
because of that then BM will decrease

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.470 
because of that then BM will decrease
because<00:04:07.650> BM<00:04:08.579> is<00:04:08.790> decreasing

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
because BM is decreasing

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.930 
because BM is decreasing
uhm<00:04:09.660> KB<00:04:10.109> is<00:04:10.260> like<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.160> mentioned<00:04:11.519> goes<00:04:11.670> up<00:04:11.819> a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
uhm KB is like I mentioned goes up a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.940 
uhm KB is like I mentioned goes up a
little<00:04:12.120> bit<00:04:12.299> but<00:04:12.569> BM<00:04:12.870> decreases<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> lot<00:04:13.680> more

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
little bit but BM decreases a lot more

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.770 
little bit but BM decreases a lot more
and<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.940> end<00:04:15.090> result<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.660> you

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
and so the the end result is that you

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.960 
and so the the end result is that you
have<00:04:15.989> less<00:04:16.139> initial<00:04:16.560> stability<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.669> this

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
have less initial stability so this

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.879 
have less initial stability so this
change<00:04:18.419> in<00:04:18.600> GM<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:19.169> due<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.560> damaged

that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
that

that
at<00:04:28.530> in<00:04:29.530> general<00:04:30.070> at<00:04:30.250> how<00:04:31.060> much<00:04:31.270> space<00:04:31.480> floods

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
at in general at how much space floods

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.930 
at in general at how much space floods
right<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.650> hull<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:32.950> damaged<00:04:33.400> how<00:04:33.580> much<00:04:33.790> is

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
right so the hull is damaged how much is

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.130 
right so the hull is damaged how much is
actually<00:04:34.060> going<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.420> float<00:04:34.570> because<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:34.960> you

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
actually going to float because that you

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.660 
actually going to float because that you
need<00:04:35.350> that<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.710> order<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.950> figure<00:04:36.130> out<00:04:36.400> that

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.570

that new GM calculation the amount
depends<00:04:40.360> on<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.450> permeability<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.380> space

depends on the permeability of the space

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.820 
depends on the permeability of the space
here's<00:04:43.030> what<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.240> mean<00:04:43.270> by<00:04:43.450> that<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:44.680> have<00:04:44.800> a

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
here's what I mean by that you have a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.500 
here's what I mean by that you have a
ship<00:04:45.190> there's<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.460> cross-section<00:04:46.180> right<00:04:46.330> and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
ship there's a cross-section right and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.750 
ship there's a cross-section right and
in<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.960> bottom<00:04:47.110> there<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.590> dry<00:04:48.070> space<00:04:48.430> or<00:04:48.730> a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
in the bottom there is a dry space or a

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.840 
in the bottom there is a dry space or a
dry<00:04:48.970> tank<00:04:49.320> if<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.530> hull<00:04:50.710> is<00:04:50.830> damaged<00:04:51.250> in<00:04:51.460> water

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
dry tank if the hull is damaged in water

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.630 
dry tank if the hull is damaged in water
can<00:04:52.060> enter<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.450> ship<00:04:52.510> then<00:04:53.460> permeability<00:04:54.460> is

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
can enter the ship then permeability is

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.120 
can enter the ship then permeability is
the<00:04:55.030> amount<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.930> given<00:04:56.200> space<00:04:56.440> that's<00:04:56.710> able

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
the amount of a given space that's able

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.700 
the amount of a given space that's able
to<00:04:57.160> be<00:04:57.280> flooded<00:04:57.760> by<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:58.090> water<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.560> if<00:04:59.620> you

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
to be flooded by that water so if you

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.520 
to be flooded by that water so if you
had<00:04:59.890> 100%<00:05:00.790> permeability<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:01.960> means<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.380> a

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
had 100% permeability that means that a

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.140 
had 100% permeability that means that a
hundred<00:05:02.950> percent<00:05:03.040> of<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.460> space<00:05:03.700> can<00:05:04.060> be

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
hundred percent of the space can be

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.760 
hundred percent of the space can be
filled<00:05:04.390> with<00:05:04.450> water<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:04.990> mean<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.440> entire

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
filled with water so I mean the entire

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.220 
filled with water so I mean the entire
thing<00:05:06.130> now<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:06.910> reality<00:05:07.240> that's<00:05:07.780> not<00:05:07.900> going<00:05:08.140> to

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
thing now in reality that's not going to

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.840 
thing now in reality that's not going to
happen<00:05:08.410> because<00:05:08.710> every<00:05:09.250> space<00:05:09.490> will<00:05:09.730> have

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
happen because every space will have

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.240 
happen because every space will have
beams<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.540> stiffeners<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.140> something<00:05:12.100> in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
beams and stiffeners and something in

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.920 
beams and stiffeners and something in
there<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:13.180> most<00:05:13.390> you're<00:05:13.510> going<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.720> see<00:05:13.870> is

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
there so the most you're going to see is

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.030 
there so the most you're going to see is
about<00:05:14.110> 95%<00:05:14.620> permeability<00:05:16.020> if<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.440> had<00:05:17.560> 75%

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
about 95% permeability if you had 75%

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.000 
about 95% permeability if you had 75%
permeability<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.360> means<00:05:19.540> that<00:05:19.720> 25%<00:05:19.950> of<00:05:20.950> that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
permeability that means that 25% of that

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.280 
permeability that means that 25% of that
space<00:05:21.580> is<00:05:21.820> being<00:05:22.000> taken<00:05:22.210> up<00:05:22.450> with<00:05:22.570> machinery

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.690 
concept of permeability in general there
are<00:06:08.200> some<00:06:08.350> guidelines<00:06:08.800> for<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.400> permeability

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700

that is air right so that's why the

want to get an idea of what it looks

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.969 
want to get an idea of what it looks
like<00:06:46.600> on<00:06:46.780> the<00:06:46.900> inside<00:06:47.050> of<00:06:47.229> a<00:06:47.440> ship<00:06:47.650> these<00:06:47.830> were

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
like on the inside of a ship these were

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.070 
like on the inside of a ship these were
just<00:06:48.100> some<00:06:48.310> videos<00:06:48.580> I<00:06:48.699> found<00:06:48.910> on<00:06:49.030> YouTube<00:06:49.150> the

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
just some videos I found on YouTube the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.570 
just some videos I found on YouTube the
roll-on<00:06:50.289> roll-off<00:06:50.620> what<00:06:51.039> I<00:06:51.069> think<00:06:51.280> is<00:06:51.370> kind<00:06:51.550> of

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
roll-on roll-off what I think is kind of

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.460 
roll-on roll-off what I think is kind of
interesting<00:06:51.789> because<00:06:52.150> this<00:06:52.479> is<00:06:52.599> one<00:06:52.750> it<00:06:53.259> shows

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
interesting because this is one it shows

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.499 
interesting because this is one it shows
them<00:06:53.650> loading<00:06:54.009> the<00:06:54.130> cars<00:06:54.370> on<00:06:54.610> it<00:06:54.729> you<00:06:55.240> can<00:06:55.389> see

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
them loading the cars on it you can see

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:57.120 
them loading the cars on it you can see
there's<00:06:55.690> a<00:06:55.750> lot<00:06:55.990> of<00:06:56.199> empty<00:06:56.410> space<00:06:56.470> and<00:06:56.979> that

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
there's a lot of empty space and that

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.570 
there's a lot of empty space and that
the<00:06:58.030> the<00:06:58.419> tours<00:06:58.780> and<00:06:59.110> the<00:06:59.590> submarine<00:07:00.099> and<00:07:00.400> the

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
the the tours and the submarine and the

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.070 
the the tours and the submarine and the
anatomy<00:07:00.789> of<00:07:01.000> a<00:07:01.150> submarine<00:07:01.539> it<00:07:01.690> shows<00:07:01.870> that

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
anatomy of a submarine it shows that

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.290 
anatomy of a submarine it shows that
space<00:07:02.740> is<00:07:02.949> very<00:07:03.160> dear<00:07:03.460> on<00:07:03.639> a<00:07:03.669> submarine<00:07:04.120> so

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
space is very dear on a submarine so

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.879 
space is very dear on a submarine so
they're<00:07:04.449> going<00:07:04.630> to<00:07:04.690> cram<00:07:04.960> stuff<00:07:05.289> in<00:07:05.470> there<00:07:05.680> in

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889 
they're going to cram stuff in there in

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:07.350 
they're going to cram stuff in there in
a<00:07:06.160> much<00:07:06.310> different<00:07:06.669> way<00:07:06.759> than<00:07:06.970> you<00:07:07.000> would<00:07:07.240> if

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
a much different way than you would if

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.730 
a much different way than you would if
you<00:07:07.449> were<00:07:07.509> designing<00:07:07.660> a<00:07:08.080> roll-on/roll-off

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
you were designing a roll-on/roll-off

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.800 
you were designing a roll-on/roll-off
ship<00:07:09.370> or<00:07:09.580> a<00:07:09.610> container<00:07:10.060> ship<00:07:10.210> or<00:07:10.599> something

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
ship or a container ship or something

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.430 
ship or a container ship or something
like<00:07:11.110> that

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
like that

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.659 
like that
so<00:07:11.919> this<00:07:12.400> gage<00:07:12.610> I<00:07:12.729> think<00:07:12.910> a<00:07:13.030> nice<00:07:13.300> idea<00:07:13.720> of<00:07:13.810> okay

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
so this gage I think a nice idea of okay

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.430 
so this gage I think a nice idea of okay
passenger<00:07:15.669> spaces<00:07:16.090> have<00:07:16.270> 90%<00:07:16.690> permeability

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
passenger spaces have 90% permeability

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.140 
passenger spaces have 90% permeability
what<00:07:17.740> does<00:07:17.860> that<00:07:17.979> actually<00:07:18.160> mean<00:07:18.430> in<00:07:18.970> real

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
what does that actually mean in real

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.999 
what does that actually mean in real
life<00:07:19.389> so<00:07:19.900> they<00:07:19.990> take<00:07:20.169> a<00:07:20.229> look<00:07:20.380> at<00:07:20.530> these<00:07:20.650> videos

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.009 
life so they take a look at these videos

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.060 
life so they take a look at these videos
and<00:07:21.280> that'll<00:07:21.669> give<00:07:21.789> you<00:07:21.880> some<00:07:22.060> idea<00:07:22.889> so<00:07:23.889> that's

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070 
and that'll give you some idea so that's

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.480 
and that'll give you some idea so that's
an<00:07:24.190> idea<00:07:24.460> about<00:07:24.550> flooding<00:07:25.419> and<00:07:26.130> the<00:07:27.130> effects

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
an idea about flooding and the effects

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.279 
an idea about flooding and the effects
of<00:07:27.610> it<00:07:27.849> um<00:07:28.030> again<00:07:28.210> I'll<00:07:28.449> try<00:07:28.810> and<00:07:28.930> post<00:07:29.080> a<00:07:29.169> video

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289 
of it um again I'll try and post a video

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.740 
of it um again I'll try and post a video
on<00:07:29.710> how<00:07:30.699> to<00:07:30.759> actually<00:07:30.880> calculate<00:07:31.150> damage

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
on how to actually calculate damage

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.629 
on how to actually calculate damage
stability<00:07:32.289> with<00:07:32.470> the<00:07:32.650> the<00:07:32.979> new<00:07:33.370> GM

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
stability with the the new GM

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.460 
stability with the the new GM
calculation<00:07:34.210> risk<00:07:34.360> it's<00:07:34.599> rather<00:07:34.810> involved<00:07:35.380> so

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470 
calculation risk it's rather involved so

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.360 
calculation risk it's rather involved so
I'm<00:07:35.530> going<00:07:35.680> to<00:07:35.710> stick<00:07:35.889> with<00:07:36.070> just<00:07:36.190> these

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370 
I'm going to stick with just these

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.610 
I'm going to stick with just these
high-level<00:07:36.820> concepts<00:07:37.240> here<00:07:37.509> so<00:07:38.229> thanks<00:07:38.530> again

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
high-level concepts here so thanks again

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.030 
high-level concepts here so thanks again
for<00:07:38.770> watching<00:07:39.009> and<00:07:39.669> see<00:07:39.970> you
