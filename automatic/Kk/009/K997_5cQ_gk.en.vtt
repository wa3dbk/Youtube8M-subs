00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
backwards compatibility he really

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.900 
backwards compatibility he really
couldn't<00:00:18.330> say<00:00:18.630> much<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> he<00:00:19.890> related<00:00:20.340> he

empathized and told people that he

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.740 
empathized and told people that he
understood<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:26.400> when<00:00:27.119> moving<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
understood how it can be when moving to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
understood how it can be when moving to
a<00:00:27.779> next<00:00:28.140> generation<00:00:28.349> system<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.580> sink<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> lot

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
a next generation system you sink a lot

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.540 
a next generation system you sink a lot
of<00:00:30.269> money<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.689> these<00:00:30.929> systems<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:32.279> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
of money into these systems and then you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
of money into these systems and then you
have<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.940> move<00:00:33.120> over<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.660> no<00:00:33.870> backwards

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
have to move over with no backwards

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
have to move over with no backwards
compatibility<00:00:35.160> that's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.850> serious<00:00:36.329> issue<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
compatibility that's a serious issue and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.220 
compatibility that's a serious issue and
I<00:00:37.410> couldn't<00:00:37.680> agree<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.329> however<00:00:39.329> when

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I couldn't agree more however when

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
I couldn't agree more however when
pressed<00:00:40.860> about<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.640> question<00:00:42.120> he<00:00:42.600> stayed

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
pressed about the question he stayed

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.720 
pressed about the question he stayed
that<00:00:43.140> he<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:44.010> couldn't<00:00:44.190> say<00:00:44.430> any<00:00:44.640> more

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that he really couldn't say any more

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750 
that he really couldn't say any more
about<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.329> however<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.620> stay<00:00:47.100> right

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
about it however I do have to stay right

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940 
about it however I do have to stay right
now<00:00:47.820> he<00:00:48.059> didn't<00:00:48.660> outright<00:00:49.110> say<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.800> there

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
now he didn't outright say that there

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
now he didn't outright say that there
was<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.520> backwards<00:00:51.000> compatibility<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
was no backwards compatibility in the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
was no backwards compatibility in the
future<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> xbox<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:54.270> alluded<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
future of the xbox one he alluded to the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
future of the xbox one he alluded to the
possibilities<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> cloud<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.670> how

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
possibilities of the cloud and how

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.930 
possibilities of the cloud and how
things<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
things like that work so I'm going to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
things like that work so I'm going to
take<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> couple<00:01:00.480> educated<00:01:01.199> guesses<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
take a couple educated guesses here and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
take a couple educated guesses here and
you<00:01:02.340> guys<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.789> hop<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> educated<00:01:04.199> guess

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you guys can hop on the educated guess

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.640 
you guys can hop on the educated guess
train<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.670> board<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.200> couple<00:01:07.500> years

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
train to to all board in a couple years

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
train to to all board in a couple years
we're<00:01:07.890> gonna<00:01:07.979> look<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.670> video<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
we're gonna look back on this video and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.170 
we're gonna look back on this video and
be<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.479> oh<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:10.200> god<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.490> no

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
be like oh my god you got it right or no

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.410 
be like oh my god you got it right or no
so<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.500> educated<00:01:14.010> guess<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so my educated guess here is that in the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
so my educated guess here is that in the
future<00:01:15.680> Microsoft<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> implement

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
future Microsoft is going to implement

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.820 
future Microsoft is going to implement
some<00:01:17.790> solution<00:01:18.360> within<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.810> cloud<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.380> allow

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
some solution within the cloud to allow

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
some solution within the cloud to allow
you<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.220> emulate<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> xbox<00:01:21.390> 360<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.110> use

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you to emulate the xbox 360 and use

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
you to emulate the xbox 360 and use
backwards<00:01:23.250> compatibility<00:01:24.119> via<00:01:24.750> their

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
backwards compatibility via their

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.080 
backwards compatibility via their
servers<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.420> for<00:01:27.420> making<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> able<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
servers there for making it able to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
servers there for making it able to
process<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.659> render<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> good

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
process and render and all that good

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
process and render and all that good
stuff<00:01:32.030> basically<00:01:33.030> they'll<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
stuff basically they'll have like you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.060 
stuff basically they'll have like you
know<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.740> room<00:01:35.100> full<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> Xbox<00:01:36.060> 360s<00:01:37.070> enabling

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
like that this new console when it comes

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.509 
like that this new console when it comes
out<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.540> should<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.290> wharf<00:02:17.769> all<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.340> other

out it should just wharf all the other
consoles<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.390> everyone<00:02:19.840> should<00:02:19.989> run<00:02:20.200> on<00:02:20.319> by

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
consoles and everyone should run on by

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
consoles and everyone should run on by
it<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.549> start<00:02:21.879> implementing

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
it so that they can start implementing

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.110

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.360 
and supporting it fully and games won't
be<00:02:25.480> fully<00:02:25.870> supported<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.680> implemented<00:02:27.220> on

be fully supported and implemented on

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.360 
be fully supported and implemented on
them<00:02:27.610> until<00:02:28.019> well<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.500> know<00:02:29.650> everyone<00:02:30.280> in

another<00:02:32.709> couple<00:02:33.099> years<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.640> believe<00:02:33.940> that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
another couple years I believe that

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.069 
another couple years I believe that
console<00:02:35.579> makers<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:37.030> supporters<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.019> those

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
console makers and supporters and those

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.979 
console makers and supporters and those
who<00:02:38.829> develop<00:02:39.040> for<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> consoles<00:02:40.239> they<00:02:40.780> won't

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
who develop for the consoles they won't

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.250 
who develop for the consoles they won't
be<00:02:41.140> all<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.650> until<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.670> know<00:02:42.840> most<00:02:43.840> people

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
be all in until you know most people

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.619 
be all in until you know most people
have<00:02:44.380> decided<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:45.040> stop<00:02:45.310> using<00:02:46.090> their

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
have decided to stop using their

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.740 
have decided to stop using their
previous<00:02:47.260> generation<00:02:47.860> tech<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.459> moved<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.510> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
previous generation tech and moved on to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
previous generation tech and moved on to
the<00:02:49.870> next<00:02:50.079> gen<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.500> that's<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.549> facts

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the next gen and that's just the facts

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.569 
the next gen and that's just the facts
life<00:02:52.120> get<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> new<00:02:52.900> generation<00:02:53.379> you<00:02:53.920> need<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
life get a new generation you need to

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.390 
life get a new generation you need to
support<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.299> fully<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:56.319> get<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.739> most<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:57.340> of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
support it fully to get the most out of

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.460 
support it fully to get the most out of
it<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.420> probably<00:02:58.720> won't<00:02:59.019> be<00:02:59.079> for<00:02:59.170> another

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
it so it probably won't be for another

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.740 
it so it probably won't be for another
couple<00:02:59.829> years<00:03:00.129> until<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.910> start<00:03:01.150> seeing<00:03:01.360> full
