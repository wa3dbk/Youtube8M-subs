00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello today we grill steaks 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.290
 i took two steaks which are the most 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.110
 popular in our stores and on the market 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.130
 this is australian marble beef here 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.179
 this is ribeye 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.460
 but this strip loin marble meat 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.189
 there are two types of grain fed and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.140
 herbal cereal fattening she more 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.179
 fatty and consequently softer 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.060
 herbal is a bit tougher and less greasy 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.740
 you see that there is a difference 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.090
 either more marble why marble 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.000
 because we see interlayers 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.490
 fatty layers inside a piece of meat 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.910
 which resemble a marble strip and 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.760
 less marble but it has a side 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.190
 a layer of fat that gives points 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.350
 taste but in spite of being bonded 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.960
 less marble and slightly tougher than 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.450
 any he has a pronounced taste 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.690
 beef but we fry both today 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.790
 so to fry us steak 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.369
 don't need to pickle him don't need him 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.079
 withstand some kind of marinades if you 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.509
 bought it in vacuum just get it 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.810
 it out of a vacuum and let it breathe 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.439
 so he bought here so pink 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.069
 beautiful color of meat and reached room 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.100
 temperatures 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:24.729
 we use a minimum of spices to us 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.729
 need black pepper add salt 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 on the other hand do the same 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.479
 sprinkle some olive oil 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.509
 right blackboard no need to go anywhere 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.009
 do not put any dishes straight with forceps 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.630
 turn over rolls in olive 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.070
 oil 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.330
 salt heart which fell on your board 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.190
 and send to the pan best 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.159
 use a cast iron pan grill 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.149
 But with such a pre-edge 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.640
 split it 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.550
 but not red of course but on the very 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.170
 heat for about five to seven minutes 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.509
 only the pan is hot we 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.490
 send meat there 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:11.400
 I almost forgot before frying meat 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:15.630
 open the windows of the door turn on the hood 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.630
 because we start to grill meat 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.480
 if you have a thick steak fry it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.450
 one and a half minutes on each side then 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.490
 on a baking tray in the oven if it is thin 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.130
 then it can be up to fry in a pan and 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.360
 again do not add butter to the pan 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.970
 first we 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.340
 sprinkle with olive oil each steak 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.430
 second when it starts to grill fat 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.080
 heats enough oil on 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.430
 frying pan that is by no means 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.800
 additionally do not use mass 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:54.030
 turn steak and what a miracle 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 we got a picture like this 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.870
 be sure to fry the ends of the joint where 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.390
 we have fat because when we 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.190
 it is slightly melted and it is slightly 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.720
 fried then when you eat 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.720
 state will recover delicious 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:20.220
 see what a smoke screen you at home but 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:25.050
 the smell is gorgeous we shift stacks 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.880
 on the parchment turn off the hood and bring 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.950
 them in the oven at about 180 degrees 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.950
 10 minutes before the morning hot saw 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.349
 10 minutes have passed we take the meat out of the oven 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:59.049
 the meat warmed up here is such a beauty 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.049
 we shift the meat on the board 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.790
 put a sprig of rosemary on each 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.620
 a piece for hot meat 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.780
 warmed rosemary and rosemary highlighted 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.750
 in the course of beef and leave the meat 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.760
 rest 45 minutes, what does it do 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.490
 when we fry it the juice rushes in 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.950
 center on temperature then meat slightly 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.700
 cools and juice spreads back 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.650
 all over the piece 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.840
 and it is very important that if you immediately hot 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.050
 a piece of cut juice will flow out 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.260
 and the meat of the rested juice will remain 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.419
 inside then the joint rested can be said 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.020
 I was sent to the Bahamas 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:45.320
 so we look what we did 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.320
 cut ribee 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.060
 see meat ready inside slightly pink 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.319
 juice is a media frying like us and 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.919
 planned to cut a piece lightly 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.919
 dosalivaem 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.900
 either I turned out great 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.400
 be sure to try it at home 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.400
 and cook easy 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.670
 real steak
