25<00:02:14.670> minute<00:02:15.150> bouts<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:16.079> think<00:02:16.590> Bellator<00:02:16.980> who's

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
25 minute bouts I think Bellator who's

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.559 
25 minute bouts I think Bellator who's
got<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.280> rethink<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.790> couple<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.150> things<00:02:18.359> but

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
got to rethink a couple of things but

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.240 
got to rethink a couple of things but
they<00:02:18.659> don't<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.230> rethink<00:02:19.379> whether<00:02:20.069> or

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
they don't have to rethink whether or

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
they don't have to rethink whether or
not<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.579> keep<00:02:20.790> Eddie<00:02:21.090> Alvarez<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.870> whatever

this<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.450> times<00:02:42.750> you're<00:02:42.840> screaming<00:02:43.170> at

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
this other times you're screaming at

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.199 
this other times you're screaming at
your<00:02:43.379> TV<00:02:43.560> set<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.189> really<00:02:44.430> hard<00:02:44.609> to<00:02:44.790> to

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
your TV set and it's really hard to to

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.670 
your TV set and it's really hard to to
follow<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.719> my<00:02:45.900> money<00:02:46.139> the<00:02:46.319> guy<00:02:46.439> who<00:02:46.500> was

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
follow from my money the guy who was

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.229 
follow from my money the guy who was
going<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.920> win<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.489> fifth<00:02:47.730> round<00:02:47.909> was<00:02:48.120> going

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
going to win the fifth round was going

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.000 
going to win the fifth round was going
to<00:02:48.299> win<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> fight<00:02:48.689> I<00:02:48.900> thought<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.590> Chandler

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
to win the fight I thought that Chandler

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.099 
to win the fight I thought that Chandler
13<00:02:50.549> rounds<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:50.970> i<00:02:51.030> think<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.299> second<00:02:51.870> round

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
13 rounds but i think that second round

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.869 
13 rounds but i think that second round
there<00:02:52.530> was<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> combination<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.489> Alvarez

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
there was a combination that Alvarez

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.339 
there was a combination that Alvarez
landed<00:02:54.329> right<00:02:54.569> at<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.750> end<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.109> round

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
landed right at the end of that round

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.009 
landed right at the end of that round
that<00:02:55.620> rocked<00:02:56.250> Chandler<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.659> three

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
that rocked Chandler and all three

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.099 
that rocked Chandler and all three
judges<00:02:58.290> at<00:02:58.709> cageside<00:02:59.040> who<00:02:59.790> saw<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.299> all<00:03:00.750> gave

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
judges at cageside who saw that all gave

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.839 
judges at cageside who saw that all gave
that<00:03:01.319> second<00:03:01.709> round<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:01.980> Alvarez<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> think

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
that second round to Alvarez so I think

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.490 
that second round to Alvarez so I think
that<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.000> second<00:03:03.510> round<00:03:03.720> was<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:04.200> key<00:03:04.379> in

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
that that second round was really key in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.050 
that that second round was really key in
this<00:03:04.590> fight<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.099> don't<00:03:05.250> think<00:03:05.400> anyone

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
this fight and I don't think anyone

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.789 
this fight and I don't think anyone
screaming<00:03:06.419> robbery<00:03:06.900> i<00:03:06.959> think<00:03:07.200> that's<00:03:07.379> insane

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
screaming robbery i think that's insane

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.039 
screaming robbery i think that's insane
but<00:03:08.069> i<00:03:08.220> think<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:08.669> now<00:03:09.359> we<00:03:09.419> get<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.780> third

that they're absolutely dominant but

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.580 
that they're absolutely dominant but
it's<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.120> until<00:03:30.419> they<00:03:30.810> suffer<00:03:31.229> the<00:03:31.349> first

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.860 
inevitable I mean even Alexander Karelin
still<00:04:35.550> lost<00:04:35.789> a<00:04:36.000> match<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.360> he's<00:04:36.479> considered

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
still lost a match and he's considered

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.420 
still lost a match and he's considered
to<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.350> greatest<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.740> all<00:04:37.889> time<00:04:38.130> so

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
to be one of the greatest of all time so

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.830 
to be one of the greatest of all time so
I<00:04:38.610> think<00:04:38.850> Michael<00:04:39.210> Chandler<00:04:39.360> he's<00:04:39.600> so

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
I think Michael Chandler he's so

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.360 
I think Michael Chandler he's so
coachable<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.530> think<00:04:40.919> he'll<00:04:41.039> be<00:04:41.130> able<00:04:41.220> to

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
coachable I think he'll be able to

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.909 
coachable I think he'll be able to
rebound<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.389> think<00:04:42.630> just<00:04:43.050> again<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.620> the

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
rebound and I think just again the the

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.129 
rebound and I think just again the the
idea<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.699> third<00:04:45.060> fight<00:04:45.389> is<00:04:45.600> just<00:04:45.990> so

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
idea of that third fight is just so

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.350 
idea of that third fight is just so
thrilling<00:04:46.560> especially<00:04:47.100> for<00:04:47.639> fans<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.150> may
