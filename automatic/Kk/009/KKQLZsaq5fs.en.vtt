00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.890
 vitesse has been training normally since the week after the training camp in spain 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.230
 papendal and that was good this week but also bad news to report we leave there 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.580
 start worse news 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 the injury of this club being a few weeks has been eliminated 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420
 that was operated on his knee again 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.439
 urcun 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.529
 the meniscus 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.409
 maybe so and so 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.989
 how exact exactly how that we also as a precursor 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.210
 I don't think so, but on my own 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.950
 I'm from 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.240
 that finds it annoying for all of us 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.860
 but it must happen 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.250
 thanks to the good news the arrival of feyenoord kelvin leerdam to vitesse 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.300
 the very talented player will be transferring free after Arnhem this coming summer 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.530
 yes i think it is very positive for this club if you see where this club is 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.160
 that comes from the company in the past 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.350
 was hard to get players and if you now 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.540
 especially in 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.060
 the very talented player who has long been 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 Ukraine also had a lot of experience in last year 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.580
 with feyenoord 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.290
 it is being second 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.940
 to achieve this there is a whole year played between sv participant is also 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.220
 an experience dealing with pressure 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.300
 and I think it still has a lot of growth potential 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.470
 So 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.230
 chapeau de this club can bring in games such as learning dam 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.030
 and what do such a talented young person say 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.150
 opt for vitesse 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.230
 well I say that says he was the one in the first half year 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.420
 show 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.560
 regarding the development of talent 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.940
 yes this club 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.510
 you still hear hammam 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.670
 Yes then the club belonged to very much on loan 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.870
 the dish 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.360
 he is being worked with those young players and 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 and that is also one of his and motivation to go to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.800
 this vitesse the vitesse kick off Saturday night for the second half 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 of the season 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.010
 8 a series of fantastic matches against ajax and psv 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.549
 and psv how does the trainer actually look at this beautiful football month 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.070
 exactly as you say I think it is super beautiful and that is how you should experience it 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 you hear that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.910
 yes nice series of competitions anything can happen there that we all know and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.290
 I am going to the markets with my confidence where Italy became later this week 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.379
 Clear that it is not natural 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.789
 So 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.129
 the winter break is behind us and the late set for intel's was there anyway 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.219
 so thought we would really like to start a course 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.889
 and that is actually the case 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.889
 this season it is exciting in the dutch league the top five in the 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.669
 winter break one on minute differences from each other 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.760
 it therefore promises to be a nice second half of the competition after 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.529
 he the position upwards after placement that is not that big a we 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.439
 have it all have all had to pay to play 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.159
 and on the key given his leg at the end of June the champion candidate number one 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.369
 if you of course 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:53.389
 Ajax 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:59.359
 large selection collective group red spot sick twente psv when I am young 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.169
 pick up the player 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.409
 Yes then 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.919
 then that is the objective view that the top candidates and 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.609
 but good at it i never exclude anything and 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.579
 because the distances are marzok line, the differences are not that bad 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.799
 big then 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.599
 yes why should know if feijenoord cannot provide a surprise 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.809
 the opponent next Saturday is up 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.889
 the alkmaarders are currently in twelfth place in the top league but the 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.589
 but with a top player in their ranks 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.939
 vitesse na simon cowell took place a few years ago and that 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.289
 remains the warm memories of his stay in North Holland a lot 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.039
 There is so that I sometimes have mature player 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.309
 it is the turn of the dutch team for club Brugge coach 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.909
 and but a fantastic time i have a fight that can also take my family there 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.109
 and get to know a little bit and get to know my wife and many friends or 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.469
 just still good contacts with the club and very nice warm club 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.469
 they are too low there 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.909
 I am sure the quality of the team is good too 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:00.689
 late 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.009
 I got it a bit 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.049
 had the misfortune of the first half year 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.399
 I think I have more quality than couples show 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.589
 from the defensive point of view 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.679
 not this competition but the NATO to win us for many competitions
