00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
 hi girls again with you today 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.469
 we come to teach you a nice project 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 like this is a flower that you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.830
 they can make a and color like that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.500
 here we can make the colors 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 flowers separately as 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.720
 we have here or we are going to teach 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 where we have qualified all the all 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.189
 important is knowing what the technique is like 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 we will also teach them quickly 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 how these flowers are already the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 we have taught but we want to renew 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.960
 again today so that you what 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.140
 can do the project once in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.560
 their homes cut 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.810
 strips here we have 1.5-wide tape 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.260
 and what we're going to do right now has a 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.360
 centimeter wide this has 20 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.370
 centimeters long we have several 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.550
 cut strips 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.129
 let's start is a very simple thing 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.590
 very easy that you are going to talk all 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:11.109
 the tapes in half 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.109
 here it is marked what will mark 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 so they have laghi they fit 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 what are the carts of each 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.370
 florecita when they already have the marks 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.060
 you are going to talk like this 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.060
 forming 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.659
 the number 8 has to give them everything 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 A) Yes 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.030
 we recommend that you place them 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.040
 on a pin 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.040
 while they are folding the others 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 to bend the tape 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 to fit them correctly 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.750
 they are introduced inside the pin 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.490
 and they are going to fix it so that they 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.490
 the form is left 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.510
 we have already introduced then 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.850
 you start to organize 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.640
 what are the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.640
 petals of this little flower or this monkey 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.740
 are going to be several are going to be several 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.500
 little flowers like this in 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.380
 different pins and they are passing them 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.310
 a stitch with needle and thread as I already 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.349
 we did in this one 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.349
 they are going together 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.780
 ready as already here we have will be armed 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.090
 they simply take out the pin what 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.090
 introduce in the one we have here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.430
 and you are getting a very nice you 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.370
 they can make the layers they want if they 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.650
 they want the biggest they can do 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.020
 from below smaller larger and smaller 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.290
 it is the pleasure of you here we are 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.040
 teaching how they can do it is a 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.630
 Very nice bun very easy to make them 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.630
 I recommend for them to do it 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.220
 here we are going to let it stop like this 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.170
 a matter of time but in their cases 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.650
 you can do the design that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 want 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.070
 We already told you what you can do in 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.580
 sitting of 1.5 or 1 centimeter of 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.480
 width 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.520
 this one has 20 centimeters long 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 several stitches pass 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.920
 to avoid being released 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 ready here we are going to leave this 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.080
 shape 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.090
 let's quickly teach them how to 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.580
 do these little flowers 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.670
 with the same strip of the same length as 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.629
 we have cut them they start make a 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.810
 fold to start making the center 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:16.700
 They make several turns dating 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.220
 you can do it with needles 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.190
 or simply here we are going to do it with 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.410
 silicone are sticking 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.510
 when you already have the center part 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.270
 you are going to bend a little 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.270
 tape and start rolling it 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.270
 when they have finished what they have 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.950
 bent place silicone still bending 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.330
 they come back and they do 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.470
 everything is in the cleaning tape 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.470
 to stick it 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.480
 and they are applying silicone 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.960
 they go rolling 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.620
 and that's how the little flower will 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.470
 last part quotes the sentences towards 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.970
 back and here they have already been short in 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.970
 this part quotes with the scissors 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.560
 seal with the candle stick well in the 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.440
 part of back so they will be 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.740
 little flowers 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.260
 and if you wish, you can decorate it 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.870
 with these flowers or with any 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.540
 another accessory that you have got here 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.480
 we have some nice buttons in wood 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.360
 this time with some beautiful flowers 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.900
 so that if you want you can paste it or 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.560
 simply place the little flowers that 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.560
 we just did 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:19.300
 It is a very cute bun very easy to them 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.300
 I recommend trying to do it 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.520
 and here we have it totally 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.430
 finished we hope you liked it 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.080
 this new idea we hope your 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.560
 comments until next 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.560
 opportunity
