00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
can do those things here that we got to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
can do those things here that we got to
go<00:00:49.860> across<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.550> try<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.790> find<00:00:51.149> people<00:00:51.420> who<00:00:51.630> can

do them we're not developing skills here
one<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.290> reasons<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.309> okay<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.020> much

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
one of the reasons is okay we are much
