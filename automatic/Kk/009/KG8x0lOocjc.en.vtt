 I recently launched on my channel 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.820
 crowdfunding campaign to collect 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.889
 funds to buy a laptop for the channel 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.619
 so that I could render the video in more 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.699
 better quality from more over 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.580
 order to tell you in principle 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.350
 ended this whole company succeeded or 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 I could not collect on a laptop in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 Interesting or I failed 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.329
 raise money to buy a laptop before 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.640
 managed even much more than me 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.989
 assumed initially I assumed 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 somewhere 800 dollars, well, with a stretch so but 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.739
 I counted more on 700 true in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.930
 end up at the moment I have a little 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.030
 more than nine hundred so up laptop 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.399

 this is a paul from a parcel from china 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.900
 tablets and phones 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.569
 This is Sergey Nasedkin 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.459
 called anyone and hopefully did not forget if 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.130
 that the description will be a complete list of those 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.870
 people who somehow helped me 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.360
 if you want to get on this list 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.610
 write me I will finish you if you suddenly 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.750
 forgot of course as promised to everyone 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.569
 those who throw off 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.230
 from 10 to 20 dollars I promised to give 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.540
 syma x5c quadcopter on the radio 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.880
 and so it happened that im a bar of 10 dollars 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.920
 Unfortunately no one was first mastered 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.910
 many applicants I think that the ruble 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.769
 40 to 60 is therefore of the odd 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.769
 list almost all fell out 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.130
 and to those people who threw from 20 to 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.180
 30 and above dollars so I promised a smartphone 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.790
 zt and about retirement and it happened that from 20 and 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.310
 more than a dollar not throwing too no one 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.010
 there are two people this pavlyuchenko 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.019
 Alexander and from Mukhambetov Rinat so 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.630
 it turned out that they threw the most money 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.090
 and their sum is approximately equal however 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.470
 rinat threw a little more so i 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.769
 distributed the places as follows 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.900
 i send alexander to syma x5c 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.150
 White Mukhambetova Renata I will send 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.040
 smartphone zt and about retirement and since so 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.470
 it turned out that he threw the most 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.930
 automatically he becomes a member 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.609
 exclusive prize which includes 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.590

 Chinese gadgets and hope for 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.459
 next week this issue will see 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.799
 light but that seems to be all 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.280
 if for some reason you disagree 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.780
 with the distribution of places or God forbid I 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.730
 forgot to somehow turn you into 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.500
