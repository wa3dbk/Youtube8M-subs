which came from here straight down to
the<00:02:13.660> transom<00:02:14.110> area<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:16.180> know<00:02:16.299> if<00:02:17.019> you<00:02:17.170> were

leaning on the into the canvas and it

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.479 
leaning on the into the canvas and it
was<00:02:23.049> just<00:02:23.230> dark<00:02:23.440> because<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.160> was<00:02:24.280> mostly

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
was just dark because it was mostly

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.819 
was just dark because it was mostly
canvas<00:02:25.269> material<00:02:25.480> o'clock<00:02:26.170> material<00:02:26.680> was

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
canvas material o'clock material was

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.979 
canvas material o'clock material was
just<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.130> tiny<00:02:27.280> little<00:02:27.519> window<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.750> dark

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
just a tiny little window in it so dark

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.510 
just a tiny little window in it so dark
and<00:02:29.110> dingy<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.560> look<00:02:29.709> online<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.310> any

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
and dingy if you look online and see any

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.280 
and dingy if you look online and see any
of<00:02:30.670> these

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
of these

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.130 
of these
these<00:02:31.620> foreign<00:02:32.129> sand<00:02:32.489> bridges<00:02:32.909> with<00:02:33.840> those

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
these foreign sand bridges with those

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.160 
these foreign sand bridges with those
with<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.709> pictures<00:02:35.010> taken<00:02:35.159> inside<00:02:35.549> they<00:02:35.760> look

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
with the pictures taken inside they look

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.420 
with the pictures taken inside they look
not<00:02:37.170> very<00:02:37.230> appealing<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.379> why<00:02:40.829> we<00:02:41.219> like

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
not very appealing so that's why we like
