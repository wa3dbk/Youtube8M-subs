think to tomorrow's game against

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.439 
think to tomorrow's game against
complexity<00:05:49.610> have<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.150> guys<00:05:50.240> thought<00:05:50.300> about

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
complexity have you guys thought about

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.209 
complexity have you guys thought about
that<00:05:50.690> yet<00:05:50.870> or<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.199> going<00:05:51.319> to<00:05:51.380> be<00:05:51.530> you<00:05:52.099> know

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
that yet or is it going to be you know

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.920 
that yet or is it going to be you know
bounce<00:05:52.460> from<00:05:52.580> this<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:52.940> go<00:05:53.030> well<00:05:53.479> I<00:05:53.690> want<00:05:53.870> to
