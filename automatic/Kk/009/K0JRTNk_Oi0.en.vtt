00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 the profit is not thin today 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 for thibaut pinot who remakes half 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.520
 its delay on the current second of the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 overall classification alejandro valverde 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.630
 more than 30 seconds maybe for 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.130
 seize the third or the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.080
 second because we must not forget no 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.720
 plus the current wearer of the white jersey 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 Roman bardet and yet yet this 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.509
 was not won at the start of this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.960
 step from the first slopes of the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.550
 lautaret the lautaret I think it's 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.350
 the hard legs of the eve in turn the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.610
 efforts of the day so more important 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.020
 today it was especially not the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.910
 waste time because 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 it was really in my worst 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 tour day so I was a little to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 the economy anyway in the final I 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.040
 not do my job I'm going to do 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.489
 to distance valverde 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.590
 these nerdy arenas bards are 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.120
 discover that I have to look at I have to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 monitor or more and a descent that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 know by heart they come 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.400
 often an internship here so you know 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 i said arnold watch out for the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.610
 descent they will do the descent 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 it was safe and that's pretty good sign 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.119
 for me ie they have who 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.080
 know that you are in the climbs 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.930
 they will not take me long one 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.479
 slid to make lose 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.550
 time on I was happy to be in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.470
 group so 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.640
 so I think I also showed that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.380
 I had chances to reject throwing 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.729
 not a pincer of mali does what he wants 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 in this dance tour de france 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.590
 yeah that's its limits if had 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 CDJA believers recreated part I like 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 not here it may be good for too 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.540
 for the gutter round where Ben regimes 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.340
 ali is quite homogeneous otherwise we 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.460
 would be bored I think so so that's 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 well and 5 6 of the same level press so 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.759
 so there is a nice battle for the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.490
 podium and that's it the balance sheet is good 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.659
 he's almost almost perfect better than 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.329
 I liked better than I hoped it was safe 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.640
 So here we are, but tomorrow there is a day 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.249
 on nîmes after the rest rest 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.869
 think if thibaut pinot was not in 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.210
 a big day today well he has 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.039
 could count on his teammates at all 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.689
 rungs of the race it's tonight that 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.939
 either jeremy roy or mathieu 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.189
 each one has the sensation of 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.359
 well done 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.399
 I tried to follow it up 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.569
 placed him at the foot well placed he was 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.670
 in the first 15 at goal so that's 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.200
 been fine and after I tried to 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.390
 to hang on to the gb theater maxims to 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.620
 four corners of the top yeah yeah after 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.470
 he often says that your good leg 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.730
 so if we tell him I know he 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.400
 was not so much today but 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.019
 that's okay anyway 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.560
 so it's okay yeah that's okay 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.470
 finally 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.489
 yeah that's okay it's after that it's gipa 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.440
 climber it's true it's not 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.299
 obvious I cling to the maximum and 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.420
 it's not obvious what is it but good 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.300
 the alps are finished yeah that's for sure 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.880
 tomorrow it's dangerous we arrive 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.190
 there are risks of borders towards Nîmes 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.430
 long step so be careful danger it's 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.780
 sure to be vigilant we would have 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.250
 loved that he takes up time all over the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 world is good it's already he saw he 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.160
 have no great legs he already has it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.380
 done 4 of the step it's still already 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.150
 super good we will not complain 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610
 yes tomorrow we have a big one he'll have to 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.590
 be careful the border and I think 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.120
 there may be some var so we will 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.560
 to protect as much as possible a little gourmet 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.380
 those who are falling and now that he 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 wants to run in front so that's it for 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.330
 we are fine because they would have 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.280
 tendency to stay behind 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.550
 now is to run ahead and that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.440
 it is leaving the alpine massif well 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.630
 sure the team fdj point fr is going to look at 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.280
 preserve this achievement from its leader 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.930
 thibaut pinot but it will also take 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.980
 think about this arrival that can 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.080
 perfectly suit 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.030
 arnaud demare if however the champion 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.710
 de France has recovered health since 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.540
 you may have seen it today 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.500
 some gastric problems are going 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.500
 prevent a good day
