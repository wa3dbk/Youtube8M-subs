00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 disgusting conditions in hostels

 finally forced to beg for 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.040
 food i quote we worked 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.900
 12 hours with an empty stomach then we 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.049
 Stayed the night without eating anything a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.090
 declared ram marmara 27 years and he 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.430
 continues when I complained my 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 manager assaulted me drove me out of the camp

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.619
 of deaths continues to increase 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 as is currently the case we can 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.259
 predict that in the end it will be 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.820
 no less than 4000 dead 4000 dead for 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.750
