of unveiling of this iphone although
we're<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.869> talking<00:02:01.110> about<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:01.560> two

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
we're all talking about it now two

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.139 
we're all talking about it now two
months<00:02:02.070> before<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> even<00:02:02.399> comes<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
months before it even comes out so in

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
months before it even comes out so in
the<00:02:03.240> end<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.719> might<00:02:03.899> actually<00:02:04.049> end<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.350> being

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the end it might actually end up being

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.569 
the end it might actually end up being
really<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.189> what<00:02:05.340> did<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.460> learn

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
really good for so what did we learn

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
really good for so what did we learn
about<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> prototype<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> 4g<00:02:07.590> phone<00:02:07.799> at

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
about the prototype or the 4g phone at

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.320 
about the prototype or the 4g phone at
least<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.280> version<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> their<00:02:08.940> plan<00:02:09.090> we

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
least this version that their plan we

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.650 
least this version that their plan we
learned<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> has<00:02:09.720> two<00:02:09.929> cameras<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
learned it has two cameras one of the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.820 
learned it has two cameras one of the
front<00:02:10.870> one<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.170> back<00:02:11.320> which<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.620> great<00:02:11.800> for

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
front one on the back which is great for

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.110 
front one on the back which is great for
sort<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.160> holding<00:02:12.430> up<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.640> phone<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:12.820> doing

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
sort of holding up the phone and doing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.970 
sort of holding up the phone and doing
face-to-face<00:02:13.630> video<00:02:13.840> calls<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.860> would

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
face-to-face video calls and that would

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.770 
face-to-face video calls and that would
be<00:02:15.010> really<00:02:15.250> cool<00:02:15.460> application<00:02:16.060> seems<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.660> have

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
be really cool application seems to have

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.480 
be really cool application seems to have
a<00:02:16.810> ceramic<00:02:17.380> back<00:02:17.620> instead<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.160> metal<00:02:18.430> or

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
a ceramic back instead of a metal or

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
a ceramic back instead of a metal or
plastic<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:19.000> which<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.270> better<00:02:19.420> for

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
plastic one which is better for

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.390 
plastic one which is better for
retention<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.260> bit<00:02:20.530> different<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.220> shape

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
retention a bit different to the shape

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.710 
retention a bit different to the shape
looks<00:02:21.430> different<00:02:21.910> I'm<00:02:22.090> I'm<00:02:22.420> inclined<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
looks different I'm I'm inclined to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.120 
looks different I'm I'm inclined to
think<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.080> that's<00:02:23.290> kind<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.590> prototype

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
think that that's kind of a prototype

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.740 
think that that's kind of a prototype
shaped<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.610> sort<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.880> new<00:02:25.000> guns<00:02:25.240> in<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.570> in

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
shaped just sort of the new guns in a in

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.360 
shaped just sort of the new guns in a in
a<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.170> fake<00:02:26.380> shell<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.010> actual<00:02:27.160> thing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
a in a fake shell and the actual thing

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.190 
a in a fake shell and the actual thing
will<00:02:27.550> look<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.730> lot<00:02:27.850> slicker<00:02:28.150> how<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> mean<00:02:29.020> how

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
will look a lot slicker how I mean how

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.320 
will look a lot slicker how I mean how
many<00:02:29.260> prototypes<00:02:29.680> do<00:02:30.160> they<00:02:30.310> make<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.240> is

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
many prototypes do they make and it is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.430 
many prototypes do they make and it is
that<00:02:31.480> typical<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.020> they<00:02:32.110> would<00:02:32.230> give<00:02:32.350> an

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that typical that they would give an

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.690 
that typical that they would give an
employee<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.890> phone<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.070> guess<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.490> walk

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
employee the phone I guess to walk

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.980 
employee the phone I guess to walk
around<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.030> test<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.750> think<00:02:34.840> they

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
around and test it out well I think they

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.660 
around and test it out well I think they
give<00:02:35.230> an<00:02:35.560> employee<00:02:35.800> like<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.160> maybe<00:02:36.370> not<00:02:36.550> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
give an employee like this maybe not the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.160 
give an employee like this maybe not the
final<00:02:37.000> look<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.390> feel<00:02:37.570> phone<00:02:37.780> he<00:02:37.930> might<00:02:38.080> be

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
final look and feel phone he might be

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.690 
final look and feel phone he might be
testing<00:02:38.530> out<00:02:38.560> some<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.920> hardware<00:02:39.250> inside

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
testing out some of the hardware inside

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.130 
testing out some of the hardware inside
it<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.060> that's<00:02:40.390> why<00:02:40.540> he'd<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:40.810> kind<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.020> an

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
it and that's why he'd have kind of an

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.320 
it and that's why he'd have kind of an
ugly<00:02:41.290> shell<00:02:41.680> around<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.160> new<00:02:42.400> inside<00:02:42.820> what's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
ugly shell around the new inside what's
