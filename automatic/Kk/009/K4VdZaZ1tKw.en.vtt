00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.680
 simple and direct argument but that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.080
 encompasses a complex text macro that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.330
 it evolves and diversifies as it 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.580
 the time advances both based on the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.460
 extravagance his realism and the absurd 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.440
 continuous 3 it is worth noting that the series 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 seems to happen in a world of magic and 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.880
 fantasy but it happens in the future 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.950

 images from a time similar to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.010

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.730
 it's an alternative world in another 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.879
 dimension 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.099

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.810
 see the ruined building and a 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.150
 military helicopter burned down and the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.220
 movie 'eat signature is set 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.659
 think that they were transforming into 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.970
 inhuman beings even when starting the 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.579
 chapter you see a movie billboard and 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.709
 a city in ruins in the background one of the 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.169
 strongest elements happens in the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.299

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.970
 and having lost half of the hemisphere 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.699
 south in what is guessed by its appearance 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.580
 it could be an explosion or the impact of 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.949
 a space body 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.289
 so far the series has not explained if 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.870
 it's about the earth without humans but 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.150
 if his disappearance his mutation and death 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.830
 for the great war of the mushrooms to 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.319
 the same has not been said if in this war 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.599
 humans fought among themselves or with 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.909
 someone else and it is something that has not been 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.270
 said about the true parents of 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.389
 finish 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.340
 in the foley mortal chapter when fini 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.349
 since they persecute the lecce he takes them 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.509
 to what look like the ruins of a 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.240
 city and it gets into a station 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.039
 underground full of human skeletons 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.250
 probably dead waiting for his 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.250
 train 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.110
 well I tell you the truth or theories 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.040
 found in articles found in 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.500
 internet one 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.750
 the truth about the series is that the end 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.910
 human fell into a very strong coma of 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.460
 that the doctors said that never 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.280
 could wake up and all his adventures and 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.770
 your friends even as they are just a 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.140
 product of your child imagination other 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.390
 theory they tell is that end was never 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.790
 very sociable and never had many friends 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.250
 and almost never left his house and 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.950
 he liked being alone one day his mother 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.320
 I buy a dog check but in order not to 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.810
 I import and one day when I went to school 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.060
 He was hit by a car but he did not die alone 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.430
 he was in a deep coma then all 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.470
 his adventures are a scenario of what 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.110
 he thought how his life could have been 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.360
 if it had been more sociable last 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.030
 theory that I have also heard is that 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.770
 order was born sick and the doctors said 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.990
 that he could never be cured and 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.390
 they asked the end mother if she 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.280
 she wanted to be sacrificed but she 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.770
 opposed and preferred that he live in 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.870
 plant state and all his adventures are 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.380
 as he thought it was life and that 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.320
 it could be if he were healthy 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.360
 as I told you those are theories I do not know if 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.310
 be true but no more wanted to do 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.250

 subscribe channel x be commented if 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.150
