00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
figure has it melted away and as I've

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.640 
figure has it melted away and as I've
mentioned<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> couple<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.170> times<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.620> past

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
mentioned a couple of times in the past

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.880 
mentioned a couple of times in the past
I<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.520> will<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.120> buy<00:03:03.390> repaints<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.260> remould

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
I I will not buy repaints and remould

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.790 
I I will not buy repaints and remould
unless<00:03:05.370> they're<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:07.020> know<00:03:07.050> they're<00:03:07.410> they're

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
unless they're you know they're they're

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.460 
unless they're you know they're they're
accurate<00:03:08.010> figures<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.090> show<00:03:09.540> or<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.350> know

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
accurate figures to the show or you know

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.980 
accurate figures to the show or you know
the<00:03:10.650> repaint<00:03:11.370> or<00:03:11.550> remould<00:03:12.090> makes<00:03:12.390> sense<00:03:12.750> in

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
the repaint or remould makes sense in

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.930 
the repaint or remould makes sense in
this<00:03:13.440> case<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.890> think<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.190> makes<00:03:14.370> perfect<00:03:14.610> sense

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
this case I think it makes perfect sense

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.010 
this case I think it makes perfect sense
because<00:03:15.920> while<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.130> as<00:03:17.370> cool<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.360> mr.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
because while it's as cool to have a mr.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.490 
because while it's as cool to have a mr.

the<00:03:50.310> fact<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.820> actually<00:03:51.000> get<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.900> a

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
the fact that you actually get that in a

the fact that you actually get that in a
figure<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.380> mean<00:03:52.560> really<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:52.950> didn't<00:03:53.190> involve

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
figure I mean really it didn't involve

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.690 
figure I mean really it didn't involve
really<00:03:53.850> any<00:03:54.180> effort<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.489> toy

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
really any effort on the on the toy

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.400 
really any effort on the on the toy
companies<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.570> produce<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:58.110> figure

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
companies and to produce this figure

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.920 
companies and to produce this figure
it's<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.620> exact<00:03:58.950> same<00:03:59.070> figure<00:03:59.519> all<00:04:00.180> around<00:04:00.750> I

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
it's the exact same figure all around I

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.449 
it's the exact same figure all around I
mean<00:04:01.050> there's<00:04:01.350> nothing<00:04:01.769> different<00:04:01.980> about<00:04:02.280> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
mean there's nothing different about the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.640 
mean there's nothing different about the
figure<00:04:02.760> aside<00:04:03.420> from<00:04:03.600> his<00:04:03.780> dome<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.500> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
figure aside from his dome and and the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.340 
figure aside from his dome and and the
dome<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.610> rubbery<00:04:06.000> addition<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.230> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
dome is just a rubbery addition so the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.720 
dome is just a rubbery addition so the
fact<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.620> they<00:04:07.769> were<00:04:07.830> just<00:04:08.010> able<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.430> change

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
fact that they were just able to change

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.540 
fact that they were just able to change
it<00:04:08.910> out<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.209> put<00:04:09.390> another<00:04:09.510> one<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.550> is

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
it out and put another one in is is

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.759 
it out and put another one in is is
smart<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.570> mean<00:04:12.750> that's<00:04:12.900> smart<00:04:13.200> marketing<00:04:13.590> guys

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769

smart I mean that's smart marketing guys
that's<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.640> way<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.820> should<00:04:15.480> put<00:04:15.780> out<00:04:15.870> a

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
that's the way you should put out a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.810 
that's the way you should put out a
remould<00:04:16.410> figure<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> one<00:04:17.400> on<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.640> other

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
remould figure and the one on the other

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.699 
remould figure and the one on the other
interesting<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.480> point<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:18.870> thing<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.530> point

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
interesting to point out thing to point

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.580 
interesting to point out thing to point
out<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.700> fact<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.419> figure<00:04:21.780> you

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
out is the fact that on this figure you

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.440 
out is the fact that on this figure you
can<00:04:22.620> actually<00:04:22.919> make<00:04:23.340> out<00:04:23.550> well<00:04:24.090> he's<00:04:24.180> got<00:04:24.330> his

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
can actually make out well he's got his

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.180 
can actually make out well he's got his
eyes<00:04:24.570> he's<00:04:24.900> got<00:04:25.050> his<00:04:25.140> nose<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.650> he's<00:04:25.770> also<00:04:25.950> got

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
eyes he's got his nose and he's also got

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.990 
eyes he's got his nose and he's also got
a<00:04:26.220> mouth<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:27.930> not<00:04:28.080> quite<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.770> ream<00:04:29.220> old<00:04:29.610> a

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
a mouth so it's not quite a ream old a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.050 
a mouth so it's not quite a ream old a
reissue<00:04:30.930> figure<00:04:31.650> because<00:04:32.280> on<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.640> mr.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
reissue figure because on this mr.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.860 
reissue figure because on this mr.
freeze<00:04:33.380> he<00:04:34.380> actually<00:04:34.680> has<00:04:34.830> no<00:04:35.130> nose<00:04:35.600> no<00:04:36.600> mouth

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
freeze he actually has no nose no mouth

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.050 
freeze he actually has no nose no mouth
and<00:04:37.310> his<00:04:38.310> face<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.790> little<00:04:39.030> more<00:04:39.770> simplistic

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
and his face is a little more simplistic

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.159 
and his face is a little more simplistic
obviously<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.150> don't<00:04:42.300> need<00:04:42.450> much<00:04:42.660> being<00:04:42.930> that

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
obviously you don't need much being that

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.490 
obviously you don't need much being that
he's<00:04:43.350> got<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.040> shield<00:04:44.340> here<00:04:44.669> or<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.090> dome<00:04:45.500> so

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
he's got the shield here or the dome so

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.460 
he's got the shield here or the dome so
I<00:04:46.530> mean<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.850> figure<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.960> figure<00:04:49.140> has

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
I mean that that figure this figure has

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.640 
I mean that that figure this figure has
the<00:04:49.770> additional

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
the additional

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.439 
the additional
remoulded<00:04:51.160> head<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.610> think<00:04:51.850> that's<00:04:52.030> all

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
remoulded head and I think that's all

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.850 
remoulded head and I think that's all
the<00:04:52.660> more<00:04:52.810> reason<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.229> want<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.470> pick<00:04:53.620> up<00:04:53.710> this

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
the more reason I want to pick up this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.110 
the more reason I want to pick up this
figure<00:04:54.220> his<00:04:54.880> one<00:04:55.090> accessory<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:56.070> his<00:04:57.810> his<00:04:58.810> ice

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
figure his one accessory is his his ice

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.050 
figure his one accessory is his his ice
would<00:05:01.120> his<00:05:01.300> ice<00:05:01.479> zapping<00:05:02.610> hand<00:05:03.610> or<00:05:03.820> whatever

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
would his ice zapping hand or whatever

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.170 
would his ice zapping hand or whatever
and<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:05.080> think<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.680> idea<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:07.030> can

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
and I think the idea is that you can

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.409 
and I think the idea is that you can
just<00:05:07.360> slide<00:05:07.690> it<00:05:07.900> into<00:05:08.220> his<00:05:09.220> whoops<00:05:09.729> to<00:05:10.300> his

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
just slide it into his whoops to his

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.640 
just slide it into his whoops to his
hand<00:05:10.660> here<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:12.449> that's<00:05:13.449> basically<00:05:13.960> then<00:05:14.560> you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
hand here and that's basically then you

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.969 
hand here and that's basically then you
got<00:05:14.800> mr.<00:05:15.100> freeze<00:05:15.370> with<00:05:15.580> his<00:05:16.410> his<00:05:17.410> ice<00:05:17.620> hand

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
got mr. freeze with his his ice hand

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.520 
got mr. freeze with his his ice hand
he's<00:05:18.970> using<00:05:19.300> his<00:05:19.449> ability<00:05:19.570> because<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.289> mean<00:05:20.440> he

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
he's using his ability because I mean he

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.290 
he's using his ability because I mean he
didn't<00:05:20.710> have<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.860> gun<00:05:21.160> in<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.460> Batman<00:05:22.030> cartoon

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
didn't have a gun in the Batman cartoon

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.950 
didn't have a gun in the Batman cartoon
he<00:05:22.810> just<00:05:23.050> shot<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.940> freeze<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.630> chill

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
he just shot the the freeze the chill

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.670 
he just shot the the freeze the chill
out<00:05:26.229> of<00:05:26.260> his<00:05:26.470> hand<00:05:26.830> so<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:28.360> think<00:05:29.199> that<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.620> think

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
out of his hand so I think that I think

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.020 
out of his hand so I think that I think
that's<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.979> pretty<00:05:30.130> neat<00:05:30.400> addition<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.850> fact

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
that's a pretty neat addition the fact

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.140 
that's a pretty neat addition the fact
that<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:31.240> got<00:05:31.419> this<00:05:32.610> one<00:05:33.610> would<00:05:33.970> almost

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
that you got this one would almost

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.000 
that you got this one would almost
suspect<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.080> I<00:05:35.110> won't<00:05:35.500> do<00:05:35.680> this<00:05:35.830> because

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
suspect and I I won't do this because

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.460 
suspect and I I won't do this because
I'm<00:05:36.220> not<00:05:36.370> that<00:05:36.550> crazy<00:05:37.210> but<00:05:37.630> one<00:05:38.080> would<00:05:38.289> won't

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
I'm not that crazy but one would won't

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.110 
I'm not that crazy but one would won't
want<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:38.830> almost<00:05:38.979> get<00:05:39.280> two<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.580> these<00:05:39.760> figures

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
want to almost get two of these figures

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.879 
want to almost get two of these figures
just<00:05:40.330> so<00:05:40.419> you<00:05:40.510> can<00:05:40.630> get<00:05:40.780> two<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.110> these<00:05:41.229> these

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
just so you can get two of these these

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.300 
just so you can get two of these these
hands<00:05:42.520> I<00:05:43.180> don't<00:05:43.720> think<00:05:43.810> though<00:05:44.349> it<00:05:44.590> fits<00:05:44.860> well

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
hands I don't think though it fits well

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.879 
hands I don't think though it fits well
on<00:05:45.340> his<00:05:45.789> other<00:05:46.000> hand<00:05:46.330> well<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.349> guess<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.680> could

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
on his other hand well I guess it could

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.219 
on his other hand well I guess it could
I<00:05:47.919> mean<00:05:48.070> you<00:05:48.340> could<00:05:48.520> get<00:05:48.699> on<00:05:48.729> both<00:05:49.060> hands<00:05:49.360> if

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
I mean you could get on both hands if

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.469 
I mean you could get on both hands if
you<00:05:50.380> ask<00:05:50.500> me<00:05:50.770> though<00:05:51.009> this<00:05:51.340> hand<00:05:51.849> I<00:05:52.150> think

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
you ask me though this hand I think

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.270 
you ask me though this hand I think
probably<00:05:52.900> makes<00:05:53.050> more<00:05:53.139> sense<00:05:53.530> on<00:05:53.680> this<00:05:53.919> mr.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
probably makes more sense on this mr.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.379 
probably makes more sense on this mr.
freeze<00:05:54.580> just<00:05:55.360> because<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.949> know<00:05:57.070> he<00:05:57.849> still

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
freeze just because you know he still

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.900 
freeze just because you know he still
has<00:05:58.510> his<00:05:58.630> ice<00:05:58.810> dome<00:05:59.160> so<00:06:00.160> it<00:06:00.370> makes<00:06:00.550> sense<00:06:00.639> that

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
has his ice dome so it makes sense that

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.230 
has his ice dome so it makes sense that
he<00:06:01.240> has<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:01.990> he<00:06:02.919> has<00:06:03.099> that<00:06:03.250> ability<00:06:03.400> by<00:06:03.880> this

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
he has that he has that ability by this

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.420 
he has that he has that ability by this
point<00:06:04.690> you<00:06:05.650> know<00:06:05.740> I<00:06:05.770> don't<00:06:06.010> think<00:06:06.070> he's<00:06:06.280> gonna

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
point you know I don't think he's gonna

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.540 
point you know I don't think he's gonna
be<00:06:07.060> much<00:06:07.330> help<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.690> anybody<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:09.250> fact<00:06:09.460> that

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
be much help to anybody the fact that

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.129 
be much help to anybody the fact that
this<00:06:09.699> has<00:06:09.849> already<00:06:10.000> melted<00:06:10.240> off<00:06:10.539> so<00:06:11.110> I

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
this has already melted off so I

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.659 
this has already melted off so I
probably<00:06:11.349> will<00:06:11.590> display<00:06:11.979> it<00:06:12.070> with<00:06:12.190> this<00:06:12.340> mr.

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
probably will display it with this mr.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.129 
probably will display it with this mr.
freeze<00:06:12.940> I'll<00:06:13.120> put<00:06:13.300> this<00:06:13.389> mr.<00:06:13.690> freeze<00:06:13.900> out<00:06:14.050> of

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
freeze I'll put this mr. freeze out of

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.950 
freeze I'll put this mr. freeze out of
the<00:06:14.229> way<00:06:14.380> though<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:15.780> definitely<00:06:16.780> would<00:06:16.930> say

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
the way though and definitely would say

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.379 
the way though and definitely would say
though<00:06:17.409> if<00:06:17.560> you're<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:17.800> big<00:06:17.979> fan<00:06:18.610> of<00:06:18.639> mr.<00:06:19.090> freeze

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
though if you're a big fan of mr. freeze

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.240 
though if you're a big fan of mr. freeze
especially<00:06:20.139> the<00:06:20.289> Batman's<00:06:20.710> mr.<00:06:21.039> freeze

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
especially the Batman's mr. freeze

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.950 
especially the Batman's mr. freeze
because<00:06:21.430> I<00:06:21.520> think<00:06:21.580> this<00:06:22.240> mr.<00:06:22.659> freeze<00:06:22.930> is

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
because I think this mr. freeze is

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.839 
because I think this mr. freeze is
probably<00:06:23.500> one<00:06:23.650> of<00:06:23.680> the<00:06:23.860> best<00:06:24.070> mr.<00:06:24.310> freezes

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
probably one of the best mr. freezes

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.060 
probably one of the best mr. freezes
I've<00:06:24.970> ever<00:06:25.150> seen<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.990> fact<00:06:26.289> that<00:06:26.409> they<00:06:26.590> they

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
I've ever seen the fact that they they

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.740 
I've ever seen the fact that they they
got<00:06:27.280> rid<00:06:27.460> of<00:06:27.520> his<00:06:27.639> glass<00:06:27.909> dome<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.510> they<00:06:28.570> put

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
got rid of his glass dome and they put

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.409 
got rid of his glass dome and they put
this<00:06:28.930> ice<00:06:29.139> dome<00:06:29.440> on<00:06:30.159> instead<00:06:30.580> I<00:06:30.789> think<00:06:30.849> makes

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
this ice dome on instead I think makes

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.320 
this ice dome on instead I think makes
perfect<00:06:31.960> sense<00:06:32.169> and<00:06:32.789> though<00:06:33.789> it<00:06:33.970> probably

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
perfect sense and though it probably

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.080 
perfect sense and though it probably
wouldn't<00:06:34.539> have<00:06:34.659> helped<00:06:34.930> Batman<00:06:35.349> and<00:06:35.500> Robin

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
wouldn't have helped Batman and Robin

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.820 
wouldn't have helped Batman and Robin
perhaps<00:06:37.090> if<00:06:37.449> they<00:06:37.690> had<00:06:37.840> put<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.199> ice<00:06:38.349> dome<00:06:38.650> on

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
perhaps if they had put the ice dome on

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.860 
perhaps if they had put the ice dome on
on<00:06:39.090> Schwarzenegger<00:06:40.090> instead<00:06:40.630> of<00:06:40.720> that

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
on Schwarzenegger instead of that

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.409 
on Schwarzenegger instead of that
horrible<00:06:41.349> outfit<00:06:41.740> he<00:06:41.889> was<00:06:42.010> wearing<00:06:42.430> maybe<00:06:43.120> the

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
horrible outfit he was wearing maybe the

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.040 
horrible outfit he was wearing maybe the
movie<00:06:43.780> wouldn't<00:06:44.050> have<00:06:44.199> sucked<00:06:44.639> as<00:06:45.639> much<00:06:46.050> but

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
movie wouldn't have sucked as much but

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.129 
movie wouldn't have sucked as much but
there<00:06:47.530> you<00:06:47.620> have<00:06:47.770> a<00:06:47.800> toy<00:06:48.280> spot<00:06:48.699> on<00:06:48.970> the<00:06:49.780> very

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
there you have a toy spot on the very

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.279 
there you have a toy spot on the very
cool<00:06:50.500> mr.<00:06:51.070> freeze<00:06:51.400> from<00:06:51.880> the<00:06:52.060> extreme<00:06:52.990> power

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
cool mr. freeze from the extreme power

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.500 
cool mr. freeze from the extreme power
line<00:06:53.680> that<00:06:53.949> was<00:06:54.310> the<00:06:54.460> ice<00:06:54.580> blast<00:06:54.940> Mr<00:06:55.300> Freeze

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
line that was the ice blast Mr Freeze

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.899 
line that was the ice blast Mr Freeze
