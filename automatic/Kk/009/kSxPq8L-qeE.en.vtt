some leather and some sneakers so I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:11.170 
some leather and some sneakers so I

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.370 
one is definitely the most daring but
when<00:02:13.970> would<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.300> better<00:02:14.570> time<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.989> wear<00:02:15.170> this

when would be a better time to wear this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.350 
when would be a better time to wear this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.220 
mean seriously there is no way your
outfit<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.940> crazier<00:02:20.540> than<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.840> person

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
outfit is crazier than the person

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:46.410 
outfit is crazier than the person
actually<00:02:21.440> performing<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.730> go<00:02:23.150> for<00:02:23.420> it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.850 

so<00:02:47.420> we're<00:02:47.690> racking<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.140> up<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.410> something<00:02:48.620> I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
so we're racking it up with something I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.130 
so we're racking it up with something I
thought<00:02:49.100> would<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.310> good<00:02:49.700> for<00:02:50.000> an<00:02:50.210> R&amp;B<00:02:50.780> sort<00:02:51.080> of

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
thought would be good for an R&amp;B sort of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.650 
thought would be good for an R&amp;B sort of
style<00:02:51.410> concert<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.850> was<00:02:53.060> specifically
