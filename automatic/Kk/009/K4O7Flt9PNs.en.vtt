00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:22.250
 so for nate and I need a father 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:26.150
 this little elastic that are provided for this 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.330
 camping effect like these small ones 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.270
 gestures like that of the little bags and 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.530
 scissors to cut the passage of 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.660
 headpiece here we are with this elastic 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.100
 there I take my ping like that I 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.159
 am going to do a measurement that will 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.030
 match exactly the width of 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:53.479
 the mat like that all the notes are 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 the same good I 'll start by cutting 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.519
 the headstand with my little ones 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.519
 scissors 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.160
 look at this mane which is a small 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.580
 a little bit a little bit a little bit 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.840
 short sawtooth so I'm going to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.460
 to upgrade so I take some 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.750
 caskets that surpasses I pushed back the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.710
 other trains to the base 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.240
 jean tour the longest case on my 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.240
 comb and I pull down 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.970
 I start again I take the hairs 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.729
 the longest screen i pull on the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:42.360
 peg and I equalize my mane 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.700
 here is a small cushion in the right direction 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.750
 but I can start an atheist like the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.910
 mane and well equalized not too long 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.869
 and dense enough to make pretty 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.800
 pawns so here I take the measure that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.070
 I had prepared I laid the foundation of the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.580
 mane and I just take the fears 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.230
 I need to make the note 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.320
 I divide into three pieces 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:17.370
 I put the case so that they 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.560
 do not cross too tight at the base 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.290
 and then I mate and there I serve 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.610
 to the end and I close my mat 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.610
 with a rubber band 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.810
 the first step is over 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.970
 we will go to the pawn stage 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.550
 now a pawn I take the mat to 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.440
 tip level of the elastic 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.870
 I put my elastic and I'm going 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.240
 wrapped my mat around the elastic 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.180
 to the base 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:58.390
 22nd elastic and I serve I do the most 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.870
 of turns possible so as to obtain a 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.060
 pawn that is tight to my base is fine 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.490
 lasts when I made it 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.230
 some like that I check they 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.680
 are all in the same alignment 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.909
 purpose of the game is that 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.840
 everything is well right we will go to the 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:22.609
 third step the elop toupee mat 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.739
 a little bit of a different technique 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.439
 I'll take just about fears 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.870
 side that I will come across and at each 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:34.459
 once I will make you my mat in 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.639
 starting by taking a small wick 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.120
 just on the basis of the right forelock and 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.629
 from the left 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.909
 once I get to the end the base 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.870
 of the night toupet where fears that me 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:52.139
 rest I know to make three strands of 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:58.590
 way to continue my mat exactly 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:04:03.719
 as on the lan call is there the wolf 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.209
 red not the same but it is not necessary that they 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.310
 stand up as on the slow as 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.219
 place he has to be in the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.840
 extension of the toupee mat so 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:17.400
 down 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:22.310
 and here our horse is ready to go 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.310
 in competition by being all noted
