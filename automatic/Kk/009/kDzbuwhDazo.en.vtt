from<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:50.269> guys<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.780> since<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.409> support<00:00:51.799> was

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890

from you guys and since the support was
so<00:00:52.040> well<00:00:52.250> I'm<00:00:52.369> definitely<00:00:52.760> gonna<00:00:52.820> be

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
so well I'm definitely gonna be

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.939 
so well I'm definitely gonna be
implementing<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.750> face<00:00:54.019> cam<00:00:54.320> in<00:00:54.500> more<00:00:54.680> videos

implementing the face cam in more videos
I'll<00:00:55.159> most<00:00:55.489> likely<00:00:55.580> be<00:00:55.879> putting<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:56.570> the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
I'll most likely be putting it in the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.960 
I'll most likely be putting it in the

the<00:01:05.059> support<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.570> video<00:01:05.780> was<00:01:05.900> really

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the support on that video was really

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.270 
the support on that video was really
well<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.409> think<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.710> was<00:01:06.770> more<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:07.250> just

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
well but I think it was more so just

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.010 
well but I think it was more so just
because<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:07.700> was<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> face<00:01:08.090> cam<00:01:08.330> rather<00:01:08.630> than<00:01:08.869> it

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
because it was a face cam rather than it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.810 
because it was a face cam rather than it
was<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.530> Supply<00:01:09.860> Drop<00:01:09.920> opening<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:10.610> let<00:01:10.759> me
