00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:11.510
 total henke feet very much 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:22.430
 have now moved to the west 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:24.949
 I think our guest possibilities 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.260
 Well recorded again so that there in 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.970
 It was then up to 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:35.090
 six minutes in a situation or 4 1 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.680
 leadership and behavior 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 have lost if players say 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.649
 have not covered so intensely 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.140
 also named after was better 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:50.200
 the first 30 minutes treated their 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.200
 koran school situations 4243 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.780
 possibility to have been reluctant to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.300
 In addition, the last 30 have 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.470
 minutes again not satisfied for me 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.540
 then we put anthology right and 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.590
 Two could be happy though 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.750
 that is not long to work off 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.240
 need three out of standard situations 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.810
 and then of course not 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.329
 happen 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 the situation but slightly pure 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.530
 is just too much 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.390
 Overall , the audience saw a game 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.189
 seen and I was there too 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.020
 from the forest crews and now have 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.610
 we play this game abroad against the rope 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.850
 Of course, that's a great thing for us 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:47.829
 but ultimately against gc starts again from 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:50.360
 have been up front yesterday 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.090
 illustrative lessons for customers 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.689
 Team looks at the whole beats 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.740
 up here before you see how to do it 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:05.869
 does not do and then we were 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.819
 to the errors of follow were not 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.190
 more are orphaned in side 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.640
 Bad passes and unnecessary bad passes 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.180
 played the opponent a lot of space left 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.450
 every shot felt was for me 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.450
 climb percent I want me 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.720
 opportunities to achieve interest and 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.319
 then I would fast 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.730
 standard situation the hit 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 I've done of course in 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.159
 told clear words found and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.040
 the player, of course, constantly went up 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:47.390
 to keep the fair raw and fair 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.299
 to raise that into the pressure if so if 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.420
 I naturally looked forward also because 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.450
 between the publishers tear very well 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.489
 rehearsed free shot to hit 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.489
 brought 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.190
 that made 43 then of course was a lot 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.180
 possible through the interruption and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.310
 also sent very much calm old 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.280
 does not even have the time heartily 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.239
 something together and then I think 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.730
 also as the game went today 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.170
 It does not deserve the point 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.940
 actually one of the moral holds 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.940
 currently on your feet too
