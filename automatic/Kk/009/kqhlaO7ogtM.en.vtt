as a top up product the last time I used
reload<00:01:07.000> was<00:01:07.270> probably<00:01:07.930> over<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:09.010> month<00:01:09.280> ago<00:01:09.430> so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
reload was probably over a month ago so

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.820 
reload was probably over a month ago so
there<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.510> going<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:10.810> some<00:01:11.049> reload<00:01:11.440> on<00:01:11.619> it

this<00:03:44.510> in<00:03:45.510> Ohio<00:03:45.900> here<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.439> is<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> expect

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
this in Ohio here this is what I expect

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.940 
this in Ohio here this is what I expect
the<00:03:48.299> side<00:03:48.510> panels<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:49.079> cling<00:03:49.439> to<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.709> water

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
the side panels just cling to that water

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.280 
the side panels just cling to that water
now<00:03:50.129> which<00:03:50.579> means<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.269> me<00:03:51.420> we're

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
now which means that to me we're

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.039 
now which means that to me we're
basically<00:03:52.650> going<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:54.180> spring<00:03:54.510> here<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.750> will

to sea courts very interested in maybe
trying<00:04:06.629> to<00:04:06.840> see<00:04:07.680> courts<00:04:07.950> finest<00:04:08.370> or<00:04:08.810> because

this<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.109> daily<00:04:10.409> driver<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.950> gets<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.370> lot

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
this is a daily driver that gets a lot

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.990 
this is a daily driver that gets a lot
of<00:04:12.090> miles<00:04:12.299> we're<00:04:13.079> talking<00:04:13.500> 15<00:04:14.129> to<00:04:14.220> 20,000<00:04:14.940> a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.469 
of miles we're talking 15 to 20,000 a
year<00:04:16.010> probably<00:04:17.010> might<00:04:17.820> even<00:04:17.850> be<00:04:18.120> looking<00:04:18.269> to

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
year probably might even be looking to

year probably might even be looking to
go<00:04:18.570> with<00:04:18.750> off<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.109> guard

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:38.809 

so<00:04:29.560> here's<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.740> roof

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.219 

and<00:04:39.819> that's<00:04:40.060> what<00:04:40.330> I'm<00:04:40.389> talking<00:04:40.750> about<00:04:40.960> there

and that's what I'm talking about there

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.640 
and that's what I'm talking about there
I<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:43.210> looks<00:04:43.449> good<00:04:43.780> it's<00:04:44.410> still

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
I like that that looks good it's still

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.529 
I like that that looks good it's still
protected<00:04:45.250> beating<00:04:45.940> well<00:04:47.340> honestly<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:49.330> hood

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
protected beating well honestly the hood

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.029 
protected beating well honestly the hood
roof<00:04:50.759> divert<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:52.000> horizontal<00:04:52.569> panels<00:04:53.039> very

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
roof divert the horizontal panels very

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.719 
roof divert the horizontal panels very
easy<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.550> clean<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:55.000> very<00:04:55.210> easy<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.569> wash<00:04:56.729> can

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
easy to clean it very easy to wash can

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.820 
easy to clean it very easy to wash can
you<00:04:57.789> use<00:04:57.909> my<00:04:58.150> master<00:04:58.539> blaster<00:04:58.990> or<00:04:59.169> blower<00:04:59.440> just

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
you use my master blaster or blower just

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.730 
you use my master blaster or blower just
to<00:04:59.919> blow<00:05:00.099> them<00:05:00.250> off<00:05:01.319> horizontals<00:05:02.319> I<00:05:02.440> can<00:05:02.590> do

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
to blow them off horizontals I can do

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.800 
to blow them off horizontals I can do
that<00:05:02.889> with<00:05:03.159> but<00:05:03.460> obviously<00:05:03.970> it's<00:05:04.180> clings<00:05:04.599> to

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
that with but obviously it's clings to

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.659 
that with but obviously it's clings to
the<00:05:04.840> water<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.229> little<00:05:05.349> bit<00:05:05.470> more<00:05:05.770> than

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
the water a little bit more than

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:17.719 
the water a little bit more than
everything<00:05:07.569> else<00:05:08.639> so<00:05:14.789> still<00:05:15.789> looks<00:05:16.000> good

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
everything else so still looks good

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.270 
everything else so still looks good
beating<00:05:18.729> still<00:05:19.150> they're<00:05:19.919> just<00:05:20.919> not<00:05:21.009> what<00:05:21.190> it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
beating still they're just not what it

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.450 
beating still they're just not what it
used<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.550> be<00:05:21.990> but<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.470> project<00:05:23.889> says<00:05:24.159> that<00:05:24.370> it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
used to be but the project says that it

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.100 
used to be but the project says that it
will<00:05:24.550> last<00:05:24.759> two<00:05:25.090> years<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:27.720> fairly<00:05:28.720> close<00:05:28.930> to

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
will last two years and fairly close to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.260 
will last two years and fairly close to
the<00:05:29.199> two<00:05:29.349> year<00:05:29.560> mark<00:05:29.590> here<00:05:30.009> I<00:05:30.190> have<00:05:30.849> no<00:05:31.030> doubts

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
the two year mark here I have no doubts

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270 
the two year mark here I have no doubts
that<00:05:31.419> it'll<00:05:31.750> last<00:05:32.289> two<00:05:32.650> years<00:05:32.919> here<00:05:33.099> on<00:05:33.190> the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
that it'll last two years here on the

that it'll last two years here on the
horizontal<00:05:33.430> surfaces<00:05:34.240> for<00:05:34.389> sure<00:05:35.729> that's<00:05:36.729> part

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
horizontal surfaces for sure that's part

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.279 
horizontal surfaces for sure that's part
of<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.300> reason<00:05:37.569> why<00:05:37.719> I'm<00:05:37.840> seriously

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289

the way it makes a car look reload on
top<00:05:45.009> of<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.280> is<00:05:45.400> phenomenal<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:46.289> haven't<00:05:47.289> tried

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
top of it is phenomenal I haven't tried

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.659 
top of it is phenomenal I haven't tried
hydro<00:05:48.039> two<00:05:48.219> yet<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:50.219> will<00:05:51.219> probably<00:05:51.430> be

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
hydro two yet and will probably be

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.730 
hydro two yet and will probably be
getting<00:05:52.330> some<00:05:52.659> of<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.810> hydro<00:05:53.199> two<00:05:53.380> here<00:05:53.650> in
