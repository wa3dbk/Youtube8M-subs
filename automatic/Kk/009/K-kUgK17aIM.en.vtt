00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 dai and bronze championships 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.230
 africa 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.940
 two years ago and who left 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.790
 the training of some a challenge 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.200
 alamos then the 1000 meters is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.540
 especially for all these runners of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.680
 800 who are used to leave in 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.439
 hallway there you see it's directly 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.000
 in the bend a special little taste 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.099
 which you have a lot of trouble starting his 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.429
 much slower than 800 meters 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.840
 classic and saw both polish 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.289
 two pussies and lewandowski all from 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.870
 following behind 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.800
 here and brahms in May at the same time 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.030
 the two hares left very quickly 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.070
 to tell you that there the riders of huy 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.390
 are a little bit scared he attention he 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.500
 there are 100 meters more and it can 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.500
 to be that can make the difference 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 obviously we left more cautiously 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 chuck who is able to pull out a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 big race and monoski also a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.329
 pioneering and a little bit disappointed at his 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 last exit on 800 m and lewandowski 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.180
 him who is the dock at the best 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.680
 performance of all the best 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.260
 performance over 1000 m of all and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.049
 all participants for a couple and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.580
 who made big time on 400 m I 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.920
 think in particular of his indoor record at 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.090
 3.37 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 see the lips that serve it not to 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.080
 great thing if the poles are done 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.080
 resume by is a stretched peloton 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.450
 for relatively fast in flight passage to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.550
 506 for the bunch you calculate 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.750
 1.6 pool if it's 2 12 we're looking 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.250
 in catching a girl of perdition on 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.880
 1000 meters far less than on 800 m 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.620
 but still one comes as meaning 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.570
 it is very good very good time of 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.010
 passage 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.400
 go we're in the last round at the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.800
 Bell 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.570
 adam scott martin lewandowski and in the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.110
 evening before on the lookout in the fourth 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.190
 position 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.630
 that's where it's going to be complicated for 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.120
 all runners 800 meters because 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.070
 that it's going to start pitifully between 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.070
 quotes the last 200 meters 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.170
 are very difficult regulars of the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.460
 lotto tracks and that's his part 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.870
 watch the fight between the two 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.520
 Polish hurts behind who will believe 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.520
 that he will go back to amman as very 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.280
 often by very far adam scott and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.530
 in front of Martin lewandowski the cons 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.170
 mohammed amman's attack if he's 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.490
 able to return to his greenhouse 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.490
 teeth pull on the arms 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.840
 a cat looks good amman for 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.400
 acceleration the final sprint 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.960
 - but damon for an attempt to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.180
 back take us to man unless that 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.010
 or marc simons who shocks alain petit 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.410
 pot it's going to be played to cat finally 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.410
 for the victory in 2 15 71
