00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.600 
weight wise compared to the defiance I
think<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.320> defiance<00:01:47.800> is<00:01:47.979> either<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.340> same<00:01:48.550> or

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
think the defiance is either the same or

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.140 
think the defiance is either the same or
possibly<00:01:49.270> less<00:01:49.570> Wow<00:01:50.320> unbelievable<00:01:51.150> because

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
possibly less Wow unbelievable because

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.600 
possibly less Wow unbelievable because
this<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.080> just<00:01:53.110> we<00:01:53.590> tell<00:01:53.830> people<00:01:54.190> at<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.369> store
