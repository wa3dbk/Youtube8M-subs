00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
of compile a list of players who I guess

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.529 
of compile a list of players who I guess
I<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.710> don't<00:00:29.279> exactly<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.269> come

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
I I don't exactly know how they come

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.720 
I I don't exactly know how they come
about<00:00:30.810> determining<00:00:31.679> exactly<00:00:31.830> who<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.550> going

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
about determining exactly who is going

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
about determining exactly who is going
to<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> list<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.680> basically<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to be on the list but it's basically a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.630 
to be on the list but it's basically a
combination<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.840> understand<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
combination as I understand it of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.299 
combination as I understand it of
players<00:00:38.640> who<00:00:39.000> had<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.510> great<00:00:39.809> season<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:41.010> maybe

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
players who had a great season but maybe

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.479 
players who had a great season but maybe
don't<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.510> best<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> cards<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.710> far<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
don't have the best of cards so far so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.060 
don't have the best of cards so far so
some<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> these<00:00:45.239> players<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.170> would<00:00:46.530> probably

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
some of these players you would probably

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
some of these players you would probably
think<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.520> might<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.149> player<00:00:48.660> who<00:00:48.960> might

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
think there might be a player who might

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.810 
think there might be a player who might
deserve<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> little<00:00:49.920> bit<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:50.340> than<00:00:50.640> them

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
deserve it a little bit more than them

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
deserve it a little bit more than them
but<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> same<00:00:52.230> time<00:00:52.440> though<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
but at the same time though you have to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.470 
but at the same time though you have to
also<00:00:53.160> consider<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> those<00:00:54.210> players

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
also consider that some of those players

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.020 
also consider that some of those players
might<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.170> higher<00:00:55.530> overall<00:00:56.010> items<00:00:56.550> than

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
might have higher overall items than

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.639 
might have higher overall items than
what<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> team<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> year<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.559> to

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
but maybe this one will be a little bit

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.199 
but maybe this one will be a little bit
more<00:03:16.959> attainable<00:03:17.430> possibly<00:03:18.430> i'm<00:03:18.790> not<00:03:18.940> exactly

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
more attainable possibly i'm not exactly

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.849 
more attainable possibly i'm not exactly
sure<00:03:19.389> how<00:03:19.720> these<00:03:19.930> cards<00:03:20.230> are<00:03:20.349> actually<00:03:20.709> going

to<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.099> divvied<00:03:21.340> out<00:03:21.549> but<00:03:22.329> yeah<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.169> is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
to be divvied out but yeah this is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.659 
to be divvied out but yeah this is
probably<00:03:23.620> going<00:03:23.949> to<00:03:24.010> be<00:03:24.069> one<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.430> funner

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.520 
probably going to be one of the funner
cards<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.239> user<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.139> middle<00:03:26.379> linebacker

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
cards to user at the middle linebacker

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.339 
cards to user at the middle linebacker
position<00:03:27.370> looky<00:03:27.730> cleese<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> beast<00:03:28.419> then<00:03:29.199> we've

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
position looky cleese a beast then we've

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.140 
position looky cleese a beast then we've
got<00:03:29.409> von<00:03:29.799> miller<00:03:30.099> as<00:03:30.340> your<00:03:30.639> left<00:03:30.909> outside

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
got von miller as your left outside

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.569 
got von miller as your left outside
linebacker<00:03:31.959> kind<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.739> interesting<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.459> they

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
linebacker kind of interesting that they

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.069 
linebacker kind of interesting that they
went<00:03:33.730> with<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:34.060> pass<00:03:34.299> rushers<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
went with to pass rushers for the

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.470 
went with to pass rushers for the
outside<00:03:35.440> linebacker<00:03:35.709> positions<00:03:36.489> but<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.299> guess

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
outside linebacker positions but I guess

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.479 
outside linebacker positions but I guess
it<00:03:37.629> kind<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:37.959> makes<00:03:38.109> sense<00:03:38.440> if<00:03:39.099> they're<00:03:39.340> going

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
it kind of makes sense if they're going

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.819 
it kind of makes sense if they're going
off<00:03:39.669> of<00:03:39.699> football<00:03:40.209> outsiders<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:41.019> lot<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.620> times

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
off of football outsiders a lot of times

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.729 
off of football outsiders a lot of times
you're<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.220> see<00:03:42.459> some<00:03:42.940> interesting

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.140 
you're going to see some interesting
analysis<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:44.919> exactly<00:03:45.400> how<00:03:45.489> they<00:03:45.669> rank<00:03:45.909> these

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
analysis on exactly how they rank these

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.330 
analysis on exactly how they rank these
players<00:03:46.479> because<00:03:46.930> pass-rushing<00:03:47.859> comes<00:03:48.129> into

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
players because pass-rushing comes into

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.979

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
play tackling comes into play even

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.409 
play tackling comes into play even
coverage<00:03:50.500> comes<00:03:50.739> into<00:03:50.979> play<00:03:51.159> so<00:03:51.729> you<00:03:52.329> know

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
coverage comes into play so you know

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.000 
coverage comes into play so you know
it's<00:03:52.599> hard<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.199> determine<00:03:53.409> who<00:03:53.979> should

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
it's hard to really determine who should

it's hard to really determine who should
be<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.790> outside<00:03:55.359> linebackers<00:03:56.049> but<00:03:56.349> it's<00:03:56.739> hard

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
be the outside linebackers but it's hard

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:57.990 
be the outside linebackers but it's hard
to<00:03:57.040> really<00:03:57.159> argue<00:03:57.549> against<00:03:57.760> guys<00:03:57.970> like

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
to really argue against guys like
