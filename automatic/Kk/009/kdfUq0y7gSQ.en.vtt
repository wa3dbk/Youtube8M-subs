is to you know use your first kill to
get<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.069> stature<00:02:29.459> or<00:02:30.000> two<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.250> user<00:02:32.880> aue

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
get a stature or two and then a user aue

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500 
get a stature or two and then a user aue
when<00:02:34.260> you're<00:02:34.970> when<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> lot<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
when you're when you have a lot of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.650 
when you're when you have a lot of
enemies<00:02:37.140> close<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.630> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
enemies close to you and so you have a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.770 
enemies close to you and so you have a
lot<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.099> stages<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.430> explode<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.569> your

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
lot of stages to explode with your

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.699 
lot of stages to explode with your
second<00:02:43.170> skill<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:44.340> thing<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.569> that<00:02:45.870> this

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
second skill the thing is that this

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.199 
second skill the thing is that this
second<00:02:47.220> skillet<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.790> think<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.120> only<00:02:48.299> has<00:02:48.769> an

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
second skillet I think it's only has an

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.199 
second skillet I think it's only has an
AoE<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.480> 2.5<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.560> cannot<00:02:53.099> explode<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.849> lot

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
AoE of 2.5 so you cannot explode a lot

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.309 
AoE of 2.5 so you cannot explode a lot
of<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.920> statues<00:02:55.920> um<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:57.390> saw<00:02:57.599> me<00:02:57.780> go<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.200> AB

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
of a statues um you saw me go for AB

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.020 
of a statues um you saw me go for AB
after<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.069> know<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.549> am<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:01.200> died<00:03:01.500> before

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
before I konradin way it wasn't probably

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.470 
before I konradin way it wasn't probably
the<00:03:04.590> smartest<00:03:05.459> thing<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.819> do<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> just

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the smartest thing to do but I just

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.089 
the smartest thing to do but I just

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.150 
enemies and this you really she's image
but<00:04:54.449> I<00:04:54.690> don't<00:04:55.080> think<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.380> would<00:04:55.560> go<00:04:55.590> for<00:04:55.800> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
but I don't think I would go for the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.659 
but I don't think I would go for the
ring

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
ring

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.510 
ring
because<00:04:57.270> if<00:04:57.930> her<00:04:58.289> first<00:04:58.560> two<00:04:58.770> skills<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.490> a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
because if her first two skills have a

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.430 
because if her first two skills have a
power<00:04:59.789> multiply<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.510> 20<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.320> know

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
power multiply of 20 this you know

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.939 
power multiply of 20 this you know
that's<00:05:02.190> really<00:05:02.630> low<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:04.530> when<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.430> have<00:05:06.949> 150

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
that's really low and when you have 150

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.629 
that's really low and when you have 150
and<00:05:08.550> power<00:05:09.449> from<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.169> fur<00:05:10.380> level<00:05:11.160> free<00:05:11.370> rink

and power from the fur level free rink

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.870 
and power from the fur level free rink
you<00:05:11.820> only<00:05:12.090> gonna<00:05:12.270> get<00:05:12.570> 30<00:05:13.380> damage<00:05:13.620> more<00:05:14.160> you

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
you only gonna get 30 damage more you

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.760 
you only gonna get 30 damage more you
know<00:05:16.789> 150<00:05:17.789> damage<00:05:18.180> or<00:05:18.389> 180<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.320> not<00:05:19.500> there<00:05:19.680> is

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
know 150 damage or 180 it's not there is

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.230 
know 150 damage or 180 it's not there is
such<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.010> big<00:05:20.280> difference<00:05:20.490> I<00:05:20.789> think<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:21.150> know

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
such a big difference I think you know

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.020 
such a big difference I think you know
getting<00:05:21.630> 20%<00:05:21.990> resistance<00:05:22.889> and<00:05:23.130> armor<00:05:23.669> F<00:05:23.789> is

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
getting 20% resistance and armor F is

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.420 
getting 20% resistance and armor F is
way<00:05:24.360> more<00:05:24.539> important<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:25.860> know<00:05:26.250> but

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
way more important and you know but

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.850 
way more important and you know but
that's<00:05:26.789> right<00:05:27.120> my<00:05:27.360> opinion<00:05:27.900> right<00:05:28.410> now<00:05:28.470> just

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:54.989 
three times so we managed to when I have

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:57.199 
three times so we managed to when I have
played<00:06:55.259> only<00:06:55.289> a<00:06:55.589> few<00:06:55.860> games<00:06:56.069> ranked<00:06:56.669> and<00:06:56.849> only

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.209 
played only a few games ranked and only

00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:01.159 
played only a few games ranked and only
with<00:06:57.389> trace<00:06:57.719> so<00:06:58.469> and<00:06:59.449> mmm<00:07:00.449> I<00:07:00.599> haven't<00:07:00.989> flossed

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
with trace so and mmm I haven't flossed

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.049 
with trace so and mmm I haven't flossed
yet<00:07:01.469> but<00:07:01.769> probably<00:07:02.219> that<00:07:02.459> probably<00:07:02.879> gonna

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.059 
yet but probably that probably gonna

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.619 
yet but probably that probably gonna
come<00:07:03.360> because<00:07:03.629> I<00:07:03.959> don't<00:07:04.529> think<00:07:04.829> Tris<00:07:05.669> is<00:07:05.909> the

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:06.629 
come because I don't think Tris is the

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:08.389 
come because I don't think Tris is the
most<00:07:06.839> powerful<00:07:07.079> I<00:07:07.379> think<00:07:07.409> there<00:07:07.739> are<00:07:07.919> stronger

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:08.399 
most powerful I think there are stronger

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.999 
most powerful I think there are stronger
heroes<00:07:08.969> than<00:07:09.239> her<00:07:09.569> but<00:07:10.229> you<00:07:10.499> know<00:07:10.619> this<00:07:10.860> is

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009 
heroes than her but you know this is
