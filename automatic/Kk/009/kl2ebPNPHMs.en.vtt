too much the last time I'm gonna finish
up<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.600> little<00:00:06.779> bit<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.140> PVCs

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
up the video a little bit on PVCs

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.850 
up the video a little bit on PVCs
in<00:00:08.820> China<00:00:09.179> bradycardia<00:00:09.870> tachycardia<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
in China bradycardia tachycardia and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430 
in China bradycardia tachycardia and
stuff<00:00:10.980> like<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.330> so<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.840> discuss<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
stuff like that so we discuss the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.799 
stuff like that so we discuss the
toxification<00:00:13.950> triggers<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> PVCs<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
toxification triggers for the PVCs and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.420 
toxification triggers for the PVCs and
arrhythmia<00:00:16.199> fibrillation<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.100> something

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
arrhythmia fibrillation is something

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240 
arrhythmia fibrillation is something
that<00:00:17.840> fibrillation<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.050> being<00:00:19.289> those<00:00:20.039> things

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
that fibrillation is being those things

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.330 
that fibrillation is being those things
that<00:00:20.369> cause<00:00:20.550> sudden<00:00:20.939> death<00:00:20.970> which<00:00:21.449> I'm<00:00:21.600> very

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
that cause sudden death which I'm very

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.590 
that cause sudden death which I'm very
familiar

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
familiar

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.630 
familiar
how<00:00:25.290> many<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.620> passed<00:00:25.920> away<00:00:26.190> and<00:00:26.430> why<00:00:26.610> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
how many of them passed away and why I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.930 
how many of them passed away and why I
have<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> defibrillator<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:28.610> anyway<00:00:29.610> now

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
have a defibrillator but anyway now

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.390 
have a defibrillator but anyway now
we'll<00:00:30.120> get<00:00:30.270> back<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.400> nutritional

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
we'll get back to the nutritional

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.930 
we'll get back to the nutritional
deficiencies<00:00:33.080> that<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.460> critical<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
deficiencies that that are critical that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490 
deficiencies that that are critical that
a<00:00:36.000> lot<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> people<00:00:36.450> don't<00:00:36.690> even<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:37.110> and

a lot of people don't even know and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
a lot of people don't even know and
again<00:00:37.739> I'll<00:00:37.920> say<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.310> because<00:00:38.640> I've<00:00:38.820> had

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
again I'll say this because I've had

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.990 
again I'll say this because I've had
plenty<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.660> experience<00:00:39.780> over<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.470> years<00:00:40.500> with

doctors that not one of them mentioned
to<00:00:44.400> me<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:45.800> potassium<00:00:46.800> magnesium<00:00:46.920> calcium

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to me about potassium magnesium calcium

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.600 
to me about potassium magnesium calcium
or<00:00:47.910> sodium<00:00:48.140> which<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.350> obviously<00:00:50.160> critical

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
or sodium which are obviously critical

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
or sodium which are obviously critical

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
one of the things too is far as it when

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
one of the things too is far as it when
somebody<00:01:00.449> thinks<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.230> sodium<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.830> think

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
somebody thinks about sodium you think

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
somebody thinks about sodium you think
about<00:01:02.190> table<00:01:02.519> salt<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.089> when<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> discuss

it's garbage real sea salt is a gift is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.430 
it's garbage real sea salt is a gift is
something<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> body<00:01:18.210> needs<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
something that the body needs and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.219 
something that the body needs and
requires<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.700> you'll<00:01:21.270> find<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.110> can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
requires and you'll find that it can

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.430 
requires and you'll find that it can
change<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.120> actually<00:01:24.299> regulate<00:01:25.290> your

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
change you can actually regulate your

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.800 
change you can actually regulate your
blood<00:01:25.710> pressure<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.450> things<00:01:27.690> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
blood pressure and do the things that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
blood pressure and do the things that
people<00:01:28.470> say<00:01:28.829> otherwise<00:01:29.490> we're<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.600> just

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
people say otherwise we're not it's just

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.590 
people say otherwise we're not it's just
the<00:01:30.960> opposite<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600

medicine because they're referring to
chemical<00:01:37.370> are<00:01:37.940> gonna<00:01:38.270> result<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.890> not

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
chemical are gonna result that is not

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.440 
chemical are gonna result that is not
the<00:01:40.250> same<00:01:40.430> thing<00:01:40.640> absolutely<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.240> same
