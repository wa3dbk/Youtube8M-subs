figured out there's like a new record
like<00:04:19.340> not<00:04:19.580> really<00:04:19.850> new<00:04:20.060> but<00:04:20.090> i<00:04:20.690> figured<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.200> way

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
like not really new but i figured a way

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.230 
like not really new but i figured a way
to<00:04:21.380> record<00:04:21.799> out<00:04:22.010> with<00:04:22.310> your<00:04:22.520> dazzle<00:04:23.000> that's

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
to record out with your dazzle that's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.120 
to record out with your dazzle that's
easy<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.830> can<00:04:24.860> use<00:04:25.100> microphone<00:04:25.669> it's

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
easy and you can use microphone it's

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.540 
easy and you can use microphone it's
using<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.630> record<00:04:29.630> system<00:04:30.560> once<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.070> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
using the record system once that the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.070 
using the record system once that the
record<00:04:31.880> system<00:04:32.300> off<00:04:32.419> youtube<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.740> then<00:04:35.050> go<00:04:36.050> to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
record system off youtube and then go to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.350 
record system off youtube and then go to
upload<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.710> then<00:04:36.800> record<00:04:37.370> from<00:04:37.640> webcam<00:04:37.700> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
upload and then record from webcam and

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.230 
upload and then record from webcam and
it<00:04:38.480> will<00:04:38.600> find<00:04:39.020> your<00:04:39.200> dazzle<00:04:39.710> little<00:04:40.070> PVR<00:04:40.820> or
