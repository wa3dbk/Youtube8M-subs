00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.239
 Message from luciano rodrigues is good 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.340
 right of luciano has a doubt that 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.130
 always walked with me and I'm sure 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.739
 Can you help me market the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.180
 confidence is easy slippers by the process 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.769
 donation, but when I make the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.670
 paperwork is a good 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.410
 amount of ink 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.359
 The sheet does not get very clean. 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.739
 may be some problem with the ink or the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.510
 paper type 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.239
 the ink that uses good quality then 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.210
 will already heat up the ink issue for 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.019
 on paper I do not know if this is probably 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.760
 is the problem 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.250
 which would be the best weight for 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.170
 process of sublimation of people when 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.570
 Speech information does not speak of grammage 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.700
 in Brazil that this idea of ​​the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.700
 recording everything because it comes from the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.620
 sublimation is in studio which is where you 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.280
 works with paint and canvas there you have it 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.190
 any issue with weight but not 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.210
 digital process the weight created yes 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.570
 but I think we have to stay 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.310
 attentive to the quality of paper 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.200
 resin in the fabric resin for three 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.090
 rivers good proper role 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.540
 it's probably your problem if you 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.180
 Are you seeing there with hair slippers? 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.860
 fabric or finished or with an end 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.990
 to the reign will be attentive in relation to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.970
 to traffic but certainly its 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.100
 problem is related to trafficking 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.170
 remembering that a little paint goes 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.030
 staying on paper will have a little bit of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:58.760
 absorption and climatic conditions is 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.840
 and talking more by adding more 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.730
