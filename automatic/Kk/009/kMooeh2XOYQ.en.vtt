styler<00:00:51.790> but<00:00:52.239> unfortunately<00:00:52.989> I<00:00:53.020> think<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.530> did

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
styler but unfortunately I think I did

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
rocky here for the day and then think of

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.260 
rocky here for the day and then think of
what<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.690> do<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.080> next<00:01:32.110> day<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.850> are<00:01:34.120> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
what to do the next day these are the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.750 
what to do the next day these are the
finished<00:01:34.780> twists<00:01:35.680> after<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.250> was<00:01:36.549> done

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
finished twists after I was done

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.789 
finished twists after I was done
twisting<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.780> they<00:01:37.930> look<00:01:38.140> pretty<00:01:38.350> good<00:01:38.470> from

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
twisting and they look pretty good from

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.980 
twisting and they look pretty good from
the<00:01:38.950> beginning<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.240> no<00:01:40.450> idea<00:01:40.780> what

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
the beginning but I have no idea what

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.900 
the beginning but I have no idea what
happened<00:01:41.380> along<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.740> way

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.050 

so<00:01:48.910> this<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.270> few<00:01:49.660> days<00:01:49.870> after<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:51.070> somehow

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
so this is a few days after and somehow

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.020 
so this is a few days after and somehow
I<00:01:52.240> feel<00:01:52.630> as<00:01:52.810> though<00:01:52.990> my<00:01:53.020> hair<00:01:53.560> felt<00:01:54.490> kind<00:01:54.970> of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
I feel as though my hair felt kind of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.720 
I feel as though my hair felt kind of
dry<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:56.220> probably<00:01:57.220> needed<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.610> be

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
dry and probably needed to be

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.120 
dry and probably needed to be
moisturized<00:01:58.330> within<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.080> few<00:01:59.320> days<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.860> think

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
moisturized within the few days I think

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.280 
moisturized within the few days I think
to<00:02:00.280> was<00:02:00.520> two<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:01.000> three<00:02:01.240> days<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:01.660> i<00:02:01.720> left<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
to was two to three days so i left the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.460 
to was two to three days so i left the
twist<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.730> definitely<00:02:04.570> feel<00:02:04.840> my<00:02:05.080> fav

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
twist in so I definitely feel my fav

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.219 
twist in so I definitely feel my fav
needed<00:02:05.980> more<00:02:06.220> moisture<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.020> can<00:02:08.200> see

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
needed more moisture and as you can see

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.580 
needed more moisture and as you can see
as<00:02:08.770> I'm<00:02:09.130> untwisting<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:10.030> twists<00:02:10.510> they<00:02:11.290> kind

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
as I'm untwisting the twists they kind

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.430 
as I'm untwisting the twists they kind
of<00:02:11.650> dry<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.460> wispy<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.660> yeah<00:02:14.200> that's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
of dry and wispy and yeah that's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.560 
of dry and wispy and yeah that's
definitely<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.190> red<00:02:15.370> flag<00:02:15.640> right<00:02:15.940> there<00:02:16.000> so

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.990 
definitely the red flag right there so
keep<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.020> mind<00:02:17.350> make<00:02:17.650> sure<00:02:17.890> your<00:02:18.550> twists

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
keep that in mind make sure your twists

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.950 
keep that in mind make sure your twists
are<00:02:19.090> nice<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.480> juicy<00:02:19.690> before<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:22.120> allow<00:02:22.780> them

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
are nice and juicy before you allow them

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.650 
are nice and juicy before you allow them
to<00:02:23.170> dry<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.800> then<00:02:23.860> untwist<00:02:24.670> them<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
to dry and then untwist them that's the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.420 
to dry and then untwist them that's the
key<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:27.040> better<00:02:27.310> twist<00:02:27.910> down<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.220> was

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
key to a better twist down so this was

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.720 
key to a better twist down so this was
basically<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.210> end<00:02:31.390> result<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.710> was<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> twist

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
basically the end result it was a twist

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.500 
basically the end result it was a twist
out<00:02:33.940> as<00:02:34.500> normal<00:02:35.500> as<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.860> could<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.610> felt<00:02:37.180> dry

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
out as normal as it could be I felt dry

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.380 
out as normal as it could be I felt dry
it<00:02:37.840> looked<00:02:38.080> dry<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.190> all<00:02:39.460> good<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.030> know

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
it looked dry but it's all good I know

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.660 
it looked dry but it's all good I know
better<00:02:40.720> for<00:02:40.840> next<00:02:41.020> time<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.890> I'm<00:02:42.190> definitely

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
better for next time so I'm definitely

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
better for next time so I'm definitely
going<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.560> proceed<00:02:44.910> tomorrow<00:02:45.910> with<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> very

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
going to proceed tomorrow with a very

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.330 
going to proceed tomorrow with a very
good<00:02:46.750> deep<00:02:47.080> conditioning<00:02:47.530> treatment<00:02:48.100> and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
good deep conditioning treatment and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.450

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
then yeah hopefully my twist out next

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.060 
then yeah hopefully my twist out next
time<00:02:51.580> would<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:52.500> pass<00:02:53.500> or<00:02:54.840> success<00:02:56.070> that's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070
