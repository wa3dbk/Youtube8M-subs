defensive<00:02:48.250> workrate<00:02:48.430> would<00:02:48.820> suggest<00:02:49.000> which

defensive workrate would suggest which

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.260 
defensive workrate would suggest which
is<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:50.110> exactly<00:02:50.260> ideal<00:02:50.740> for<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.580> scent<00:02:51.970> Ford

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190

no<00:02:57.190> defensive<00:02:57.640> he<00:02:58.180> still<00:02:58.780> got<00:02:59.620> back<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.130> defend

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430

a lot more than I would have wanted

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.060 
a lot more than I would have wanted
because<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.290> wanted<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.590> play<00:03:02.739> mass<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
because I wanted to play mass and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.680 
because I wanted to play mass and
sacking<00:03:03.340> player<00:03:03.520> but<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.209> guess<00:03:04.390> these<00:03:04.540> were

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
sacking player but I guess these were

sacking player but I guess these were
crates<00:03:04.900> are<00:03:05.110> ideal<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.709> wanted<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.070> play

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
crates are ideal if you wanted to play

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.060 
crates are ideal if you wanted to play
like<00:03:06.820> someone<00:03:07.300> like<00:03:07.480> yaya<00:03:08.140> toure<00:03:08.440> who<00:03:08.830> can

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
like someone like yaya toure who can

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.830 
like someone like yaya toure who can
defend<00:03:09.370> an<00:03:09.700> attack<00:03:10.030> although<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.570> guy<00:03:10.780> is

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
defend an attack although this guy is

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.930 
defend an attack although this guy is
definitely<00:03:11.530> not<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.890> solid<00:03:12.280> defensively<00:03:12.670> as

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
definitely not a solid defensively as

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.650 
definitely not a solid defensively as
Tory<00:03:13.300> he<00:03:13.780> has<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> nice<00:03:14.170> shot<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.590> him<00:03:14.709> nothing

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.210 
Tory he has a nice shot on him nothing
spectacular<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:17.200> score<00:03:17.530> some<00:03:17.560> nice<00:03:17.950> goals

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
spectacular can score some nice goals

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.120 
spectacular can score some nice goals
but<00:03:19.320> sometimes<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.440> just<00:03:20.560> feels<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.980> his

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
but sometimes it just feels like his

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.699 
but sometimes it just feels like his
shop<00:03:21.340> hours<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.850> too<00:03:22.030> much<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.390> him<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.810> he

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
shop hours just too much for him and he

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.770 
shop hours just too much for him and he
does<00:03:23.920> blaze<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.370> over<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> fair<00:03:24.940> bit<00:03:25.090> his<00:03:25.450> finish

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
does blaze it over a fair bit his finish

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.050 
does blaze it over a fair bit his finish
shot<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:26.140> quite<00:03:26.860> nice<00:03:27.070> he<00:03:27.370> scored<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.700> couple<00:03:27.850> of

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
shot is quite nice he scored a couple of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.660 
shot is quite nice he scored a couple of
good<00:03:28.870> finesse<00:03:29.200> shots<00:03:29.440> for<00:03:29.620> me<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.739> got<00:03:30.520> some

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
good finesse shots for me and got some

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.190 
good finesse shots for me and got some
nice<00:03:30.820> curve<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.239> them<00:03:31.360> as<00:03:31.510> well<00:03:31.690> around<00:03:32.020> the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
nice curve on them as well around the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.020 
nice curve on them as well around the
goalkeeper<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:33.190> overall<00:03:33.459> his<00:03:33.730> shooting

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
goalkeeper but overall his shooting

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.199 
goalkeeper but overall his shooting
isn't<00:03:34.350> particularly<00:03:35.430> spectacular<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.880> would

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
isn't particularly spectacular I would

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.000 
isn't particularly spectacular I would
have<00:03:37.299> said<00:03:37.540> Farfan<00:03:38.260> shooting<00:03:38.650> was<00:03:38.769> better

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
have said Farfan shooting was better

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.220 
have said Farfan shooting was better
even<00:03:39.430> though<00:03:39.580> yes<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:40.480> ready<00:03:40.720> like<00:03:40.989> eight

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
even though yes it is ready like eight

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.729 
even though yes it is ready like eight
points<00:03:41.709> lower<00:03:41.890> his<00:03:42.580> pace<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.470> actually<00:03:44.470> I

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
points lower his pace is actually I

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.770 
points lower his pace is actually I
think<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.310> bit<00:03:45.489> underrated<00:03:45.940> he<00:03:46.269> does<00:03:46.450> feel

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
think a bit underrated he does feel

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.390 
think a bit underrated he does feel
pretty<00:03:46.810> quick<00:03:47.320> might<00:03:47.799> just<00:03:47.920> because<00:03:48.250> he's

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
pretty quick might just because he's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.130 
pretty quick might just because he's
small<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.239> don't<00:03:49.480> know<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.690> looks<00:03:49.840> like<00:03:49.930> he's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
small so I don't know it looks like he's

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.690 
small so I don't know it looks like he's
going<00:03:50.320> fast<00:03:50.530> or<00:03:50.739> something<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.250> he

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
going fast or something but he

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.550 
going fast or something but he
definitely<00:03:51.910> feels<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.510> bit<00:03:52.630> quicker<00:03:52.870> than<00:03:53.080> 85

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
definitely feels a bit quicker than 85

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.229 
definitely feels a bit quicker than 85
face<00:03:53.830> or<00:03:54.160> maybe<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.459> was<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:54.640> playing<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.120> slow

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
face or maybe I was just playing in slow

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.210 
face or maybe I was just playing in slow
defenders<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.350> he's<00:03:56.620> definitely<00:03:56.799> got<00:03:57.070> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
defenders but he's definitely got the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.250 
defenders but he's definitely got the
pace<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.700> play<00:03:57.910> as<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> centre-forward<00:03:58.690> or

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
pace to play as a centre-forward or

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.330 
pace to play as a centre-forward or
