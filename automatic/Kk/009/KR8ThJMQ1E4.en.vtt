00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
so how do they start out compared to a

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.940 
so how do they start out compared to a
buzz<00:01:54.420> though<00:01:54.630> they're<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.530> similar

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
buzz though they're like pretty similar

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
buzz though they're like pretty similar
actually<00:01:56.100> yeah<00:01:56.490> pretty<00:01:56.789> true<00:01:57.479> straight<00:01:57.959> line

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
actually yeah pretty true straight line

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually yeah pretty true straight line
like<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.709> straight<00:01:59.099> a<00:01:59.280> straight<00:01:59.700> mid-range<00:02:00.149> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
like a straight a straight mid-range it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.459 
like a straight a straight mid-range it
doesn't<00:02:01.579> there<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.090> thought<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> probably
