your washing machine pumps water out of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
your washing machine pumps water out of
it<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.150> where<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> go

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it this is where it go

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.259 
it this is where it go
the<00:02:13.470> reason<00:02:13.830> there's<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.099> p-trap<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.849> here<00:02:15.090> is

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
the reason there's a p-trap in here is

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.890 
the reason there's a p-trap in here is
that<00:02:15.510> water<00:02:15.900> will<00:02:16.470> always<00:02:16.860> sit<00:02:17.220> here<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.300> here

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
that water will always sit here and here

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.330 
that water will always sit here and here
and<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.200> part<00:02:19.470> will<00:02:19.500> always<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:20.010> full<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and this part will always be full of

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.330 
and this part will always be full of
water<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.330> keeps<00:02:21.690> any<00:02:21.930> gases<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:23.069> might

the street it keeps those gases from
coming<00:02:28.769> up<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.720> having<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> smell<00:02:31.080> of

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
installed behind me the 3-inch vent we

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.069 
installed behind me the 3-inch vent we
originally<00:03:23.489> planned<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:24.000> using<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.420> 2-inch<00:03:24.630> fan

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
originally planned on using a 2-inch fan

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.319 
originally planned on using a 2-inch fan
and<00:03:25.319> as<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.980> reviewed<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.489> code<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.760> found<00:03:27.180> that

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
and as I reviewed the code I found that

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.849 
and as I reviewed the code I found that
we<00:03:27.420> had<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.810> three<00:03:28.109> inch<00:03:28.290> vent<00:03:28.590> it's

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
we had to have a three inch vent it's

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.740 
we had to have a three inch vent it's
it's<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.549> code<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> building<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.599> what

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
it's the code for the building of what

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.080 
it's the code for the building of what
we're<00:03:30.900> doing<00:03:31.019> here<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:32.940> a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
we're doing here so this this is a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.270 
we're doing here so this this is a
3-inch<00:03:33.709> abs<00:03:35.420> sewer<00:03:36.420> pipe<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:37.769> runs<00:03:38.040> all<00:03:38.250> the

way up the inside of the wall we cut a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.620 
way up the inside of the wall we cut a
hole<00:03:40.410> through<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> ceiling<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.760> continues<00:03:42.480> to
