00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.759 
me see if I can put it on I heard the
hoods<00:04:07.299> were<00:04:07.949> small<00:04:08.949> but<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:10.049> think<00:04:11.049> I<00:04:11.409> can<00:04:11.590> slip

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
hoods were small but I think I can slip

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.509 
hoods were small but I think I can slip
my<00:04:11.919> head<00:04:12.129> in<00:04:12.250> there<00:04:12.400> without<00:04:12.549> ruining<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.540> I

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
my head in there without ruining it I

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:25.659 
my head in there without ruining it I
don't<00:04:15.519> think<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.819> will<00:04:15.879> hurt<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.349> home

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:42.640 

get<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.689> strap<00:04:27.020> out

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.220 

so<00:04:43.650> here<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:43.980> is<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:45.300> hoods<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.660> little<00:04:45.900> small

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
so here it is the hoods a little small

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.659 
so here it is the hoods a little small
but<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.620> still<00:04:46.949> fits<00:04:47.130> my<00:04:47.340> head<00:04:47.550> pretty<00:04:47.790> good

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
but it still fits my head pretty good

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.900 
but it still fits my head pretty good
I'm<00:04:50.669> definitely<00:04:51.300> gonna<00:04:51.419> keep<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.870> tag<00:04:52.820> if<00:04:53.820> I
