 specially progression for strength 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.070
 glass 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.230
 the watch has a quartz movement 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.270
 chronograph pro new in this stopwatch 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.330
 see here the hand is worth by the second 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.020
 the chronograph hand then starts 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.350
 top right click you see she 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350
 went 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.490
 same button set the bottom 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.160
 we have left small glade 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.280
 this minute division of the chronograph is old 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 the second hand will circle here in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.510
 this room the streaks of the arrow will move on 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 one division 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.410
 it will mean that we have detected giving 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.630
 the air was this time of day that is to 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.470
 determine the day now or return on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.670
 In this example, we have 7 hours 26 minutes 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.990
 we see it is 19 pm they are 7 am 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.810
 because the arrow is between 18-24 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.750
 scriptures if it were seven in the morning 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.240
 the arrow would be right here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.369
 opposite side of the dial 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.509
 to set the time you just need 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.509
 move the crown away from the case and 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.530
 twist it so that the arrows move 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.330
 clockwise in the opposite direction 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.200
 you can't twist otherwise 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.160
 mechanism 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.380
 This will not be a warranty case. 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.729

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.850

 the current date is set again in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.630
 the crown only needs to be set 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.020
 in an intermediate position between 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.980
 fully and completely 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.130
