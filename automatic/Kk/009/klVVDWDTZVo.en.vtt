00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
if I really want to but I didn't even

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.680 
if I really want to but I didn't even
spawn<00:00:54.399> these<00:00:54.640> these<00:00:54.790> were<00:00:55.000> just<00:00:55.210> out<00:00:55.629> and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
spawn these these were just out and

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.750 
spawn these these were just out and
around<00:00:56.020> and<00:00:56.290> there's<00:00:56.680> uh<00:00:56.739> there's<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.579> decent

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
around and there's uh there's a decent

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.520 
around and there's uh there's a decent
amount<00:00:58.030> of<00:00:58.300> them<00:00:58.450> all<00:00:58.600> around<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.290> think

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
amount of them all around and I think

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.740 
amount of them all around and I think
that<00:00:59.680> it's<00:00:59.800> it's<00:01:00.250> not<00:01:00.399> too<00:01:00.670> much<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:01.210> not<00:01:01.420> too

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
that it's it's not too much it's not too

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.020 
that it's it's not too much it's not too
little<00:01:01.930> it's<00:01:02.620> just<00:01:02.950> like<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.250> perfect<00:01:03.550> amount

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
little it's just like the perfect amount

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.800 
little it's just like the perfect amount
that<00:01:04.300> are<00:01:04.420> around<00:01:04.660> here<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:06.009> I'd<00:01:06.670> say<00:01:07.000> i<00:01:07.300> see

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
that are around here and I I'd say i see

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.800 
that are around here and I I'd say i see
about<00:01:07.930> five<00:01:08.110> of<00:01:08.619> them<00:01:08.740> every<00:01:09.070> time<00:01:09.810> probably

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810
