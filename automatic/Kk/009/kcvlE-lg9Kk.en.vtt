 that can take away that medal and that 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.340
 can approach can also hurt 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.530
 also to berta ferreras anamaría 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.309
 alexandre and 17 years a physicist 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.470
 spectacular about 70 in height very 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.960
 thin a very large personality 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.960
 sack personality 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.700
 a spectacular figure score 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.790
 76 400 was the only one that broke the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.059
 Russian domain of the figures and very large 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.950
 candidate for her second medal returns to 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.990
 to opt 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.990
 a classic cut in his last 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.030
 one 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780
 and if I 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.920
 no no 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.590
 well the voice of placid Sunday has 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.760
 sounded to the pool music in Spanish s 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.760
 'Alfonsina and the sea' 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.790
 that caused the preliminary a failure 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.620
 technician instead of sounding this music sounded 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.380
 the owl's music is the lake of the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.650
 swans' was caused the bewilderment of 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.110
 Anamaría was finally able to perform 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.390
 perfectly your routine a routine like 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.260
 we have seen wonderful has a lot 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.610
 personality a lot of class is very much 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.610
 This full swimmer control fills the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.870
 water fills the pool and captures the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.819
 attention has that magic 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.879
 that very few are lists 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.700
 they can not get the attention of a 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.750
 pool so big about what it is 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.630
 doing in the water 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.060
 has not stopped we have seen that all the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.190
 routine was full of difficulty of 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.900
 execution d 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.090
 in short, I like it a lot, I think 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.810
 It would be fair to be a medalist too 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.810
 in this alone 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:27.450
 and let's see what happens with respect to 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.610
 Ukraine is first placed 86 points 86 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.060
 points has returned to be group do very 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.460
 above so you have attention for 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.860
 have an expert problem with this 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.920
 score will have to make a 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.780
 wonderful routine to overcome these 86 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.960
 points in the preliminary 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.949
 Berta had 86,600 but 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.250
 this woman was ahead of her in four 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.460
 hundredths to the figures and there goes to 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.460
 to be
