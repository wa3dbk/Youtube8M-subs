00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.029 
4's a couple leaves 1 by 2 hinge plates
the<00:00:27.050> opposite<00:00:28.050> directions<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.680> each<00:00:28.830> one

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the opposite directions on each one

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.179 
the opposite directions on each one
there<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.750> used<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.590> light<00:00:31.890> gray

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
there and then I just used a light gray

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.400 
there and then I just used a light gray
but<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> could<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:33.000> probably<00:00:33.870> black<00:00:34.170> or

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
but you could use probably black or

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.000 
but you could use probably black or
whatever<00:00:34.710> dark<00:00:35.430> grey<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> 1<00:00:36.239> by<00:00:36.360> 2<00:00:36.420> jumper<00:00:37.020> plate

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
whatever dark grey a 1 by 2 jumper plate

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.200 
whatever dark grey a 1 by 2 jumper plate
a<00:00:38.329> couple<00:00:39.329> studs<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.960> couple<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.379> by<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.770> plate

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
a couple studs a couple one by one plate

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.750 
a couple studs a couple one by one plate
1<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.600> 2<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:42.989> 3<00:00:43.260> plate<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.910> used<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
1 or 2 by 3 plate and I just used a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
1 or 2 by 3 plate and I just used a
cheese<00:00:47.760> slope<00:00:48.120> 1<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.510> 2<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> sticker<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
cheese slope 1 by 2 with a sticker on it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
cheese slope 1 by 2 with a sticker on it
there<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.399> could<00:00:50.670> use<00:00:50.910> whatever<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
there you could use whatever if you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.930 
there you could use whatever if you
might<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> piece<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:55.940> printed

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
might have a piece like that printed

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
might have a piece like that printed
tile<00:00:57.210> whatever<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> control<00:00:58.739> panel

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
tile whatever just for the control panel

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
tile whatever just for the control panel
and<00:00:59.309> then<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.660> these<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.199> guess<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and then one of these I guess that's a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
and then one of these I guess that's a
modified<00:01:02.399> plate<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.239> studs<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
modified plate with the studs on the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
modified plate with the studs on the
side<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.489> let's<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.900> first

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
side so let's get right into it so first

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
side so let's get right into it so first
off<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> put<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.189> hinge<00:01:08.490> plate

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
off you want to put your hinge plate

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
off you want to put your hinge plate
together<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.330> won't<00:01:09.450> put<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.860> backwards<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
together you won't put this backwards so

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
together you won't put this backwards so
that<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> studs<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.360> opposite<00:01:12.780> direction

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
that the studs are opposite direction

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.100 
that the studs are opposite direction
that<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.460> hinge<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.299> part<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that way you can hinge this part up and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
that way you can hinge this part up and
you<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:16.890> put<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.159> jumper<00:01:17.520> plate<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.060> there

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you will put your jumper plate on there

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
you will put your jumper plate on there
and<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.040> 1<00:01:20.490> by<00:01:20.640> 2<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.420> 1<00:01:21.689> by<00:01:21.840> 4<00:01:22.369> tiles

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and take your 1 by 2 or 1 by 4 tiles

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.520 
and take your 1 by 2 or 1 by 4 tiles
those<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> part<00:01:25.020> standing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
those are going to be the part standing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.999 
those are going to be the part standing
up<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> front<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.290> like<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> then

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
up in the front just like that and then

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.200 
up in the front just like that and then
take<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.509> modified<00:01:30.860> plate<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> studs

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
take your modified plate with the studs

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
take your modified plate with the studs
on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> side<00:01:33.659> pop<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.520> then

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
on the side pop that in there and then

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.600 
on the side pop that in there and then
take<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.299> slope<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.619> maybe<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:38.070> printed

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
take your slope or maybe your printed

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.060 
take your slope or maybe your printed
tile<00:01:39.360> whatever<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.890> right

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
tile whatever you have put that right

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.230 
tile whatever you have put that right
here<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:42.869> control<00:01:43.530> panel

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
here it's going to be your control panel

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.560 
here it's going to be your control panel
so<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.479> got<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.020> far<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.759> then<00:01:47.759> I'm

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
1 by 3 plate just kind of put them where

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.340 
1 by 3 plate just kind of put them where
one<00:01:57.899> stud<00:01:58.549> forward<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> there

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.560 

let<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.420> hook
