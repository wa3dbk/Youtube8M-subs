00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.399 
and just rode like aggressive in some
bits<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.510> was<00:03:53.629> really<00:03:53.810> happy<00:03:54.049> with<00:03:54.260> that

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
bits and I was really happy with that

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.140 
bits and I was really happy with that
but<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.709> messy<00:03:55.310> like<00:03:55.489> getting<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.790> bit<00:03:55.939> loose

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
but just messy like getting a bit loose

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.479 
but just messy like getting a bit loose
and<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.659> mean<00:03:57.319> that's<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:57.920> what<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.069> want<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.340> do

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
and I mean that's just what I want to do

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.759 
and I mean that's just what I want to do
i'm<00:03:58.640> pretty<00:03:58.819> happy<00:03:59.000> like<00:03:59.599> where<00:04:00.230> i<00:04:00.260> finished

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
i'm pretty happy like where i finished

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.069 
i'm pretty happy like where i finished
considering<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.519> run<00:04:01.700> ahead<00:04:01.849> but<00:04:02.299> diff<00:04:02.870> is

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
considering the run ahead but diff is

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:44.749 
considering the run ahead but diff is
room<00:04:03.409> for<00:04:03.590> improvement

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.909 

I'm<00:04:45.759> pretty<00:04:46.150> surprising<00:04:46.449> it<00:04:46.750> felt<00:04:47.440> good<00:04:47.650> but<00:04:47.800> I

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
I'm pretty surprising it felt good but I

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.050 
I'm pretty surprising it felt good but I
just<00:04:48.100> thought<00:04:48.220> without<00:04:48.400> many<00:04:48.550> mistakes<00:04:48.850> on

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
just thought without many mistakes on

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.219 
just thought without many mistakes on
such<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.270> short<00:04:49.419> track<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.840> wouldn't<00:04:50.050> be<00:04:50.139> good

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
such a short track it wouldn't be good

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.980 
such a short track it wouldn't be good
enough<00:04:50.440> but<00:04:50.759> Stokes<00:04:51.759> that's<00:04:52.090> exactly<00:04:52.720> wanting

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
enough but Stokes that's exactly wanting

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:49.940 
enough but Stokes that's exactly wanting
to<00:04:53.050> do<00:04:53.139> this<00:04:53.259> weekend<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.880> I'm<00:04:54.880> happy
