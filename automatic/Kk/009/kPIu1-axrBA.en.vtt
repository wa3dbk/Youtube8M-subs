hey<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.410> name<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.740> Gary<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.220> I'm<00:00:02.580> here<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.090> just

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey my name is Gary and I'm here to just

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.320 
hey my name is Gary and I'm here to just
show<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:04.190> to<00:00:05.190> demonstrate<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.819> little<00:00:06.089> bit

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
show you to demonstrate a little bit

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.140 
show you to demonstrate a little bit
about<00:00:06.660> computer<00:00:07.410> monitors<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.160> radiation<00:00:08.940> I

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
about computer monitors and radiation I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.980 
about computer monitors and radiation I
have<00:00:09.900> here<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> simple<00:00:10.710> radiation<00:00:11.990> monitor

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
have here a simple radiation monitor

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680 
have here a simple radiation monitor
this<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.410> measures<00:00:13.980> both<00:00:14.759> electric<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this one measures both electric and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.220 
this one measures both electric and
magnetic<00:00:16.490> radiation<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.990> set<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
magnetic radiation and I have it set to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.340 
magnetic radiation and I have it set to
the<00:00:19.880> zero<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.970> three<00:00:21.449> range<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.990> magnetic<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
the zero to three range on magnetic and

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.320 
the zero to three range on magnetic and
there<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.500> studies<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.730> there<00:00:27.119> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
there are studies out here out there you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.689 
there are studies out here out there you
can<00:00:27.510> read<00:00:27.660> lots<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.019> books<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
can read lots of books about them that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.850 
can read lots of books about them that
talk<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.500> effects<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:33.860> long-term

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
talk about the effects of long-term

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.229 
talk about the effects of long-term
exposure<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.670> magnetic<00:00:36.660> radiation<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:38.239> they

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
exposure to magnetic radiation and they

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.040 
exposure to magnetic radiation and they
seem<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.040> milligauss<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
seem to say that about one milligauss is

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
seem to say that about one milligauss is
about<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.770> amount<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> don't<00:00:44.489> want<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
about the amount that you don't want to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930 
about the amount that you don't want to
go<00:00:44.879> over<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:46.469> terms<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.950> being<00:00:47.190> exposed<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
go over in terms of being exposed to it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
go over in terms of being exposed to it
for<00:00:48.120> long<00:00:48.329> periods<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.780> time<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.110> short

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
for long periods of time for short

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
for long periods of time for short
periods<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.680> time<00:00:49.789> no<00:00:50.789> big<00:00:50.969> deal<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.329> if

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
periods of time no big deal but if

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.369 
periods of time no big deal but if
you're<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> sit<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.079> front<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> your

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you're going to sit in front of your

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're going to sit in front of your
monitor<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:53.039> eight<00:00:53.190> hours<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.550> day<00:00:54.620> then<00:00:55.620> it's

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
monitor for eight hours a day then it's

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
monitor for eight hours a day then it's
something<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.520> don't<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.239> over<00:00:57.660> one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
something you don't want to be over one

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.000 
something you don't want to be over one
milligauss<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> scale<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
milligauss so here is the scale you can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
milligauss so here is the scale you can
see<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.850> middle<00:01:03.059> band<00:01:05.420> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
see it's actually the middle band that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
see it's actually the middle band that
is<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> read<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> magnetic<00:01:07.260> 0<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> 3

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
is going to read the magnetic 0 to 3

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.330 
is going to read the magnetic 0 to 3
range<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.200> I'm<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.530> using<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> these

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
range and I'm here using one of these

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.289 
range and I'm here using one of these
new<00:01:12.330> LCD<00:01:12.930> monitors<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
new LCD monitors and we're just going to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
new LCD monitors and we're just going to
move<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.420> meter<00:01:19.020> closer<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> closer<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
move the meter closer and closer and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.200 
move the meter closer and closer and
watch<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.650> watch<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.159> peg<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> little

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
watch the watch the peg go up a little

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.719 
watch the watch the peg go up a little
bit<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.950> hit<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bit and they are just hit the one so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
bit and they are just hit the one so
that's<00:01:26.909> where<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.600> wouldn't<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.140> any

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that's where I really wouldn't be on any

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440 
that's where I really wouldn't be on any
closer<00:01:28.710> than<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.880> long<00:01:30.060> periods<00:01:30.420> of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
closer than that for long periods of

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
closer than that for long periods of
time<00:01:30.540> I'm<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> back<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.100> see

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
time I'm going to back up you can see

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980 
time I'm going to back up you can see
that's<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.790> close<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.450> less<00:01:33.750> than<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that's pretty close so I'm less than a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.940 
that's pretty close so I'm less than a
foot<00:01:34.229> away<00:01:34.320> from<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> monitor<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.920> way<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
foot away from the monitor and the way I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.280 
foot away from the monitor and the way I
have<00:01:38.340> mine<00:01:38.610> set<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.500> I'm<00:01:40.500> pretty<00:01:41.189> far<00:01:41.460> away<00:01:41.610> so

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
have mine set up I'm pretty far away so

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.569 
have mine set up I'm pretty far away so
that's<00:01:43.290> pretty<00:01:43.619> good<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:43.979> pretty<00:01:44.130> safe

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that's pretty good that's pretty safe

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.030 
that's pretty good that's pretty safe
now<00:01:45.110> we're<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> move<00:01:46.439> over<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
now we're going to move over just to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760 
now we're going to move over just to
show<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> comparison<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:49.110> old<00:01:49.320> type<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
show a comparison of the old type of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.319 
show a comparison of the old type of
monitor<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.490> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> people<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:51.090> still

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
monitor which a lot of people are still

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.700 
monitor which a lot of people are still
using<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:54.079> have<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.170> monitor<00:01:55.560> just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
using and I have this monitor just

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.740 
using and I have this monitor just
plugged<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> wall<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.509> even

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
plugged in to the wall it's not even

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.609 
plugged in to the wall it's not even
connected<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> computer<00:01:58.530> and<00:02:00.500> here<00:02:01.500> we're

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
connected to a computer and here we're

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.830 
connected to a computer and here we're
going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> look<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> monitor<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
going to look at the monitor here at the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.280 
going to look at the monitor here at the
meter<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.840> maybe

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
meter and right now I'm about maybe

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.080 
meter and right now I'm about maybe
three<00:02:07.710> feet<00:02:07.950> away<00:02:09.530> I'm<00:02:10.530> getting<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.090> well

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
three feet away I'm getting to be well

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.640 
three feet away I'm getting to be well
I'm<00:02:12.209> still<00:02:12.510> probably

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I'm still probably

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.520 
I'm still probably
over<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:15.540> close<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.989> three<00:02:16.200> feet<00:02:16.379> away

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
over probably close to three feet away

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.580 
over probably close to three feet away
here<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.260> see

here and it's on the one as you can see

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.640 
here and it's on the one as you can see
now<00:02:19.739> watch<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.129> happens<00:02:20.400> when<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> get<00:02:20.790> closer

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
now watch what happens when I get closer

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.339 
now watch what happens when I get closer
whoa<00:02:22.680> we're<00:02:23.340> over<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.640> three<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.480> we're

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
whoa we're over the three and we're

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.550 
whoa we're over the three and we're
still<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:25.920> far<00:02:26.220> away<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:27.410> we're<00:02:28.410> at<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
still pretty far away and we're at a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.970 
still pretty far away and we're at a
distance<00:02:28.980> where<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> lot<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.519> people<00:02:29.760> actually

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
distance where a lot of people actually

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.699 
distance where a lot of people actually
are<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.760> their<00:02:32.910> heads<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.450> their<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
are and have their heads and their and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.680 
are and have their heads and their and
long-term<00:02:35.220> exposure<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.879> especially<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.569> you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
long-term exposure if especially if you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.300 
long-term exposure if especially if you
work<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.920> computer<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:40.129> something<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.250> be

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
work on a computer so something to be

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.080 
work on a computer so something to be
aware<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> choice<00:02:44.190> use<00:02:44.879> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
aware of if you have a choice use the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.900 
aware of if you have a choice use the
newer<00:02:45.299> LCD<00:02:46.019> monitors<00:02:46.470> because<00:02:46.799> they<00:02:47.459> emit<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
newer LCD monitors because they emit a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.150 
newer LCD monitors because they emit a
lot<00:02:48.120> less<00:02:48.390> radiation<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.829> library

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
lot less radiation and go to the library

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.000 
lot less radiation and go to the library
check<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.610> book<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> effects<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
check out a book on the effects of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.800 
check out a book on the effects of
electromagnetic<00:02:56.010> radiation<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.910> human

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
electromagnetic radiation on the human

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.530 
electromagnetic radiation on the human
body<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.790> you'll<00:02:59.790> probably<00:02:59.940> get<00:03:00.269> one<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
body and you'll probably get one of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.420 
body and you'll probably get one of
those<00:03:00.629> LCD<00:03:01.349> monitors<00:03:01.829> if<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.099> don't<00:03:02.280> already

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
those LCD monitors if you don't already

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.509 
those LCD monitors if you don't already
have<00:03:02.549> one<00:03:02.730> after<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.269> read<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.569> book<00:03:04.190> bye<00:03:05.190> for

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
have one after you read the book bye for

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.740 
have one after you read the book bye for
now

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750
