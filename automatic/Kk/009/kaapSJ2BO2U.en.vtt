this<00:04:20.400> car<00:04:20.670> has<00:04:21.000> an<00:04:21.420> ly<00:04:21.989> six<00:04:22.470> which<00:04:23.160> is

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
this car has an ly six which is

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.620 
this car has an ly six which is
equivalent<00:04:23.580> some<00:04:23.940> people<00:04:24.180> think<00:04:24.420> is

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
equivalent some people think is

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.990 
equivalent some people think is
equivalent<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.440> an<00:04:25.560> ls2<00:04:25.890> with<00:04:26.310> ls3<00:04:26.760> heads

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
equivalent to an ls2 with ls3 heads

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.030 
equivalent to an ls2 with ls3 heads
anywho<00:04:28.550> all<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.610> did<00:04:30.000> was<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.110> Texas<00:04:31.500> speed<00:04:31.800> and
