 Good people, I'll show you how it is. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:12.480
 the scheme of the end panel is cd 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.030
 it is but first and if this panel 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 here o 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 I researched this image on google. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.609
 panels of cars but it is not a detail 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 pro to be very detailed to light 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.939
 It's these numbers are zinho here. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.099
 the speedometer and everything in this background 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.309
 all behind and has to be black 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.890
 there is not that I'm here in the car okay 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.610
 seeing that the whole bottom panel of it is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.370
 all black only numbers that are from other 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 red white colors understood is when 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 you already know that light does not go through 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.230
 black part 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.719
 there is no light in the tray that neither the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.190
 outline that the little paper here you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.909
 other colors they are with the light and the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.490
 black can not you see that light does not 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.060

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.400

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:32.369
