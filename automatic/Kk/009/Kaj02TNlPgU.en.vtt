 Today we make really delicious 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 Creamy soup with wild rice 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.730
 wanted to look like the recipe 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 Just prepare it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.970
 while here I'm tearing myself 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 130 grams of normal wholemeal rice 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.219
 and diana would cook 530 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 minutes for this travels that will 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.879
 In any case, the soup is enough 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.629
 make 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.610
 and I have been here for three years 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 relatively old you see it here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.700
 which must also away and therefore will 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.160
 I once utilize therefore a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.600
 fast uneven chop and at 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.100
 the ties here we go 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 and because not nice pieces off and then 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 Let's take a carrot cut in half 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.460
 the and the quarter and then cut 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.729
 then have the down in small dice 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.430
 I'm here half an onion here 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.439
 I'll use it now 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.340
 onion here I will one now 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.869
 small and then on a down 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.130
 cut and then you do have a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.659
 pot on the stove hot because we are the same 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.000
 sweat year with the carrots and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.869
 Knobler will be cutting in the loo goal 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.860
 I have here the pearls once and for 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.490
 just as finely chop 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.770
 the onion but we start is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.460
 right from the brick mountain onion if you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:56.659
 partly cut and vertically 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.420
 just snowing down 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.969
 March take us once a pot 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.079
 get so heated give shot 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.560
 olive oil pure 1 tablespoon approximately 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:14.040
 and then there's more to this 23 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.980
 minutes later we go to the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.670
 Add carrots and garlic 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:27.000
 let everything with two minutes 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:34.830
 stew and give then touched a22 for 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.019
 this recipe here chicken stock looked then 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.530
 let's go 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.530
 Let's take water 300 grams approximately 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.890
 and then give this nation then can 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.230
 to get the water in earlier that 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.060
 Chicken broth to and easy 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.290
 all through that against a bit too 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.150
 little white house I enter me 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:06.530
 a little more on that 500 grams are that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.730
 Now let's give ours 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.000
 chicken station this is one 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.680
 Single piece is synonymous me right me 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 I 'm in the mood for meat that is then 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.050
 was washed as frozen and it 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.790
 is just so into the water that will 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.590
 immediately shows up and then which one 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.130
 few times turn the poorly even 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.560
 The like now 15 minutes away 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.580
 also 15 minutes and that will now 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.290
 we still give everything 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.790
 rosemary with contents four spoons 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.000
 rosemary in half a teaspoon full 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.210
 motivate and a quarter teaspoon 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.120
 at half a teaspoon marjoram very much 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.220
 beautiful flavors everything fits today 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.030
 hungry from soot possibility lineup 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 in the half time 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.400
 but analyze that a bit through 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.860
 say yes summery rom 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.960
 that fits anyway and then we will 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.090
 give the old herd again and 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.340
 so it happens cooked and we want it 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.590
 now it will be out soon 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.870
 cut and who breaks it too 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.030
 finished in the tires not just there 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.500
 in and now let's see if we are 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.030
 have to go a little bit more 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.600
 which is very likely because you 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.760
 See is at the erwin stew but we give 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.370
 now no more than then 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.510
 maybe another one would have to 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.210
 to prepare liquid 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.690
 so that we can go in here right now 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.280
 can 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.760
 and we do it here with one 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.340
 chicken breast go down and cut 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.020
 The once in stripes and you 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.350
 See is not completely cooked in the 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.720
 but I smile to give it to you 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.919
 other pieces by not easy 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.870
 just not at that time because i did not care 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.420
 yes, have taken the bus 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.400
 an officer is the pot of the industry 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.840
 and then I will become my second 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.060
 sauce for that we prepare his art 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.480
 books be more so next to us in 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.840
 butter and cut us first 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.820
 piece off look I'll take 75 grams that 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.010
 the good will melt once 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.710
 can you see here that hurts already 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.930
 and then I'll add some flour 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.170
 so then you already have the mother gm 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.010
 once the flour to that and 30 grams 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.180
 rather a happy one and then 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.880
 which once again now on 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.040
 Give the stove a bit of scaffolding and 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.200
 then I agree, I am 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.800
 closed again but 30 grams to 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.350
 to go 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:47.280
 So we now have 60 540 grams of butter 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:52.380
 look too little the classic bitter 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.970
 several but it also tastes very good 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.710
 if we get it right we'll do it 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.490
 right at the end, that's all 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:04.010
 Burn a bit and then come 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.010
 you then give me here now 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.410
 we have moved through it once 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.440
 also change the hearing aid with the 400th 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.130
 milk and we give for the 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.310
 taste half a cup 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.800
 Add designer and jena now 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.080
 that old on the stove and beat one 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.050
 until the mass so until the non 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.510
 is completely created by the through 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:40.500
 The flour is already applied as constant 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:43.350
 there you can see through the slow movement 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.590
 the whisk and, of course, still 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.090
 we also have salt pepper 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.750
 a superb also not made 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.710
 so spice as always there before only 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.640
 Maybe then maybe a bit 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.200
 liquid must give way to brotherly 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.190
 but let's go have it here 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:05.180
 Naturally 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.680
 once our chicken and me clicked 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.120
 the simple sauce so in there 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:14.860
 it is very unusual but more so 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.940
 the really mega give me a tasteless 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.880
 that just went through everything 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.830
 fold in and you already look like creamy 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.840
 and this is the way it is so I am now 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.520
 finished I will not show now 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.650
 I'll serve you to the plate 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.000
 take a picture and you can do it 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.200
 give it now what he wants 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.460
 with me is finished now but you can 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.840
 you gave her peas now 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.510
 Other things can be done in summer 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.690
 pursue it is a free elections 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.340
 can modify as he wants and young 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.540
 I'm out of town, hopefully 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.540
 in the next video again
