as<00:00:18.090> well<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.960> wonder<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.740> collect<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500 
as well so I wonder when you collect a
monograph<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.880> put<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.210> images

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
monograph and put all these images

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.470 
monograph and put all these images
together<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.859> differences<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:24.150> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
takes on a nostalgia element so you look

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
takes on a nostalgia element so you look
at<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:13.770> ten<00:01:14.610> years<00:01:14.640> later<00:01:15.030> 20<00:01:15.810> years

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
at something ten years later 20 years

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
at something ten years later 20 years
later<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.590> enough<00:01:16.860> 30<00:01:17.460> 40<00:01:17.970> years

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
later that's not enough 30 40 years

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
later that's not enough 30 40 years
later<00:01:18.299> things<00:01:18.930> begin<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> change<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
later things begin to change so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.380 
later things begin to change so
therefore<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> look<00:01:20.549> back<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> 50s

it<00:03:12.730> not<00:03:12.849> analyzing<00:03:13.359> and<00:03:13.659> say<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> am<00:03:13.930> having

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
it not analyzing and say I am having

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.039 
it not analyzing and say I am having
trouble<00:03:14.409> with<00:03:14.859> this<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:16.239> difficulty<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.780> began

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
trouble with this the difficulty I began

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.140 
trouble with this the difficulty I began
to<00:03:17.200> have<00:03:17.319> with<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.590> was<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.609> my<00:03:18.880> work

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
to have with it was that my work

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.000 
to have with it was that my work
actually<00:03:19.389> was<00:03:19.959> getting<00:03:20.290> stronger<00:03:20.739> and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
actually was getting stronger and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.280 
actually was getting stronger and
stronger<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.609> when<00:03:22.569> I<00:03:22.599> say<00:03:22.810> stronger<00:03:23.169> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
stronger and when I say stronger and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.280 
stronger and when I say stronger and
stronger<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.750> doesn't<00:03:26.139> necessarily

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
stronger the that doesn't necessarily

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.319 
stronger the that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:03:26.680> better<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.250> better<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.669> know<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.090> term

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
mean better and better you know the term

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.330 
mean better and better you know the term
the<00:03:28.720> word<00:03:28.900> stronger<00:03:29.410> normally<00:03:29.950> means<00:03:30.099> better

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the word stronger normally means better

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.770 
the word stronger normally means better
the<00:03:30.549> work<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.879> stronger<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.450> therefore<00:03:31.690> it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the work is stronger so therefore it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.770 
the work is stronger so therefore it
must<00:03:31.900> be<00:03:32.079> better<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.400> term<00:03:33.609> stronger<00:03:34.209> doesn't

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
must be better the term stronger doesn't

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.289 
must be better the term stronger doesn't
necessarily<00:03:35.290> work<00:03:35.470> well<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.950> magazine

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
necessarily work well in a magazine

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.580 
necessarily work well in a magazine
context<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.690> might<00:03:37.959> be<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:38.169> the<00:03:38.410> shop

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
context it might be that the shop

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.860 
context it might be that the shop
becomes<00:03:38.889> too<00:03:39.099> heavy<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.910> sometimes<00:03:40.150> heavies<00:03:40.840> a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
becomes too heavy so sometimes heavies a

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.509 
becomes too heavy so sometimes heavies a
better<00:03:41.139> word<00:03:41.319> than<00:03:41.470> stronger<00:03:41.859> right<00:03:42.099> but<00:03:42.370> my

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
better word than stronger right but my

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.309 
better word than stronger right but my
work<00:03:42.669> became<00:03:42.910> heavier<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:43.989> therefore

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
work became heavier so therefore

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.750 
work became heavier so therefore
sometimes<00:03:44.620> magazines<00:03:45.280> were<00:03:45.400> looking<00:03:45.609> for

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
sometimes magazines were looking for

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.849 
sometimes magazines were looking for
something<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:46.180> little<00:03:46.239> bit<00:03:46.599> light<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.290> frothy

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
something a little bit light and frothy

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.990 
something a little bit light and frothy
and<00:03:48.280> poppy<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.569> in<00:03:50.440> fact<00:03:50.799> my<00:03:51.579> work<00:03:51.790> was

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and poppy and in fact my work was

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.030 
and poppy and in fact my work was
becoming<00:03:52.299> more<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.690> more<00:03:52.810> iconic<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.560> maybe

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
becoming more and more iconic and maybe

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.199 
becoming more and more iconic and maybe
I<00:03:54.099> was<00:03:54.250> going<00:03:54.430> back<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:54.579> my<00:03:54.790> roots<00:03:54.970> and

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
I was going back to my roots and

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.789 
I was going back to my roots and
graphics<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.870> shots<00:03:56.349> were<00:03:56.530> simply

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
graphics and the shots were simply

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.390 
graphics and the shots were simply
becoming<00:03:57.069> heavier<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.620> nice<00:04:00.370> thing

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
becoming heavier and the nice thing

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.270 
becoming heavier and the nice thing
about<00:04:00.639> that<00:04:00.970> period<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.449> time<00:04:01.660> from<00:04:01.870> about<00:04:02.280> 86

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
about that period of time from about 86

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.479 
about that period of time from about 86
to<00:04:03.519> 92<00:04:04.169> which<00:04:05.169> I<00:04:05.440> did<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> huge<00:04:05.889> amount<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.280> work

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
to 92 which I did a huge amount of work

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.720 
to 92 which I did a huge amount of work
that<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:08.019> nice<00:04:08.230> thing<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.980> has<00:04:09.250> happened

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
that the nice thing that has happened

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.110 
that the nice thing that has happened
about<00:04:09.849> that<00:04:10.090> these<00:04:10.690> shots<00:04:11.049> which<00:04:11.620> were<00:04:11.889> at<00:04:12.879> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
about that these shots which were at the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.000 
about that these shots which were at the
time<00:04:13.329> seemed<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.810> bit<00:04:13.840> heavy<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.530> magazines

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
time seemed a bit heavy in the magazines

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.129 
time seemed a bit heavy in the magazines
now<00:04:15.699> you<00:04:15.760> remove<00:04:16.239> them<00:04:16.479> because<00:04:16.930> they're<00:04:17.019> all

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
now you remove them because they're all

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.560 
now you remove them because they're all
large<00:04:17.349> format<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:18.310> remove<00:04:18.609> them<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:18.940> then

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
large format you remove them and then

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.699 
large format you remove them and then
you<00:04:19.690> begin<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:19.989> put<00:04:20.199> them<00:04:20.320> in<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.440> book

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
you begin to put them in a book

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
you begin to put them in a book
and<00:04:20.979> then<00:04:21.100> you're<00:04:21.220> going<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> put<00:04:21.519> them<00:04:21.579> on<00:04:21.699> a

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
and then you're going to put them on a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.460 
and then you're going to put them on a
wall<00:04:21.940> they<00:04:22.660> actually<00:04:22.960> look<00:04:23.110> better<00:04:23.139> than<00:04:23.410> all

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
wall they actually look better than all

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.170 
wall they actually look better than all
then<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:23.979> magazine<00:04:24.130> right<00:04:24.729> not

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
then it in the magazine right not

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.400 
then it in the magazine right not
because<00:04:25.360> I'm<00:04:25.479> saying<00:04:25.690> they're<00:04:25.840> great<00:04:26.020> charts

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
because I'm saying they're great charts

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.570 
because I'm saying they're great charts
I'm<00:04:26.530> not<00:04:26.680> say<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:26.949> they<00:04:27.100> just<00:04:27.190> look<00:04:27.370> better

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
I'm not say that they just look better

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.510 
I'm not say that they just look better
it's<00:04:28.300> it's<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.410> way<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.620> shot<00:04:30.039> if<00:04:30.280> their

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's it's it's the way I shot if their

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.600 
it's it's it's the way I shot if their
shots<00:04:30.759> were<00:04:30.970> becoming<00:04:31.300> heavier<00:04:32.229> more<00:04:33.009> iconic

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
shots were becoming heavier more iconic

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.089 
shots were becoming heavier more iconic
mm-hmm<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.660> then<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.229> get<00:04:35.349> to<00:04:35.410> isolate<00:04:35.889> them

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
mm-hmm and then you get to isolate them

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.469 
mm-hmm and then you get to isolate them
you<00:04:36.340> don't<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.639> have<00:04:36.669> text<00:04:37.090> around<00:04:37.270> there

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
you don't have to have text around there

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.610 
you don't have to have text around there
you<00:04:37.599> know<00:04:37.690> what<00:04:37.810> they're<00:04:37.900> doing<00:04:38.289> you<00:04:38.470> know

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
you know what they're doing you know

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.740 
you know what they're doing you know
it's<00:04:38.919> sure<00:04:39.039> by<00:04:39.370> itself<00:04:39.669> it's<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.270> by<00:04:40.449> itself

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
it's sure by itself it's just by itself

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.499 
it's sure by itself it's just by itself
but<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.440> style<00:04:42.310> was<00:04:42.610> more<00:04:42.910> appropriate<00:04:43.030> for

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
but the style was more appropriate for

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.870 
but the style was more appropriate for
something<00:04:43.990> iconic<00:04:44.169> on<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.680> wall<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.759> know

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
something iconic on a wall you know

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.600 
something iconic on a wall you know
where<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.419> maybe<00:04:46.810> a<00:04:46.900> better<00:04:47.620> fashion<00:04:47.979> shot<00:04:48.370> is

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
where is maybe a better fashion shot is

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.540 
where is maybe a better fashion shot is
a<00:04:48.849> spontaneous<00:04:49.449> shot<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.280> girl<00:04:51.280> running

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
a spontaneous shot of a girl running

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.680 
a spontaneous shot of a girl running
down<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:51.849> street<00:04:51.970> looking<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.360> her<00:04:52.449> handbag

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
down the street looking in her handbag

the head the hip can prevent the blood
getting<00:05:45.009> for<00:05:45.219> the<00:05:45.280> brain<00:05:45.460> for<00:05:45.699> a<00:05:45.729> brief<00:05:46.000> moment

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210
