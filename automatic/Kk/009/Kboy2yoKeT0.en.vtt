so<00:00:00.480> today<00:00:00.840> we're<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> talk<00:00:01.350> about<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:02.040> Z

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so today we're going to talk about the Z

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.570 
so today we're going to talk about the Z
health<00:00:02.550> RFA's<00:00:03.389> manual<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.230> DVD<00:00:04.620> set<00:00:04.950> which

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
health RFA's manual and DVD set which

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.990 
health RFA's manual and DVD set which
I'm<00:00:06.299> not<00:00:06.450> exaggerating<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:07.350> think<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.670> most

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
I'm not exaggerating I think is the most

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.680 
I'm not exaggerating I think is the most
important<00:00:10.280> foundational<00:00:11.280> piece<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:12.240> your

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
important foundational piece of your

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.430 
important foundational piece of your
whole<00:00:13.110> movement<00:00:13.679> training<00:00:14.250> program<00:00:14.759> okay<00:00:15.660> no

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
whole movement training program okay no

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.620 
whole movement training program okay no
I<00:00:16.470> /<00:00:16.619> Billy<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.150> let<00:00:18.150> me<00:00:18.300> explain<00:00:18.690> why

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
I / Billy here let me explain why

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
I / Billy here let me explain why
basically<00:00:21.630> right<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.859> fundamental<00:00:23.490> issue

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
basically right the fundamental issue

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.359 
basically right the fundamental issue
that<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.359> solves<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.769> if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.220> an

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that it solves is that if you have an

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.099 
that it solves is that if you have an
old<00:00:26.550> injury<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.720> pain<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
old injury or you have pain and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.200 
old injury or you have pain and
discomfort<00:00:28.470> when<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.070> moving<00:00:29.220> that's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
discomfort when you're moving that's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.080 
discomfort when you're moving that's
what<00:00:30.420> you're<00:00:30.570> feeling<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.250> but<00:00:32.250> 99<00:00:32.610> percent

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
what you're feeling right but 99 percent

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.760 
what you're feeling right but 99 percent
of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> time<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.079> thing<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> you're

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
of the time the thing that you're

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
of the time the thing that you're
feeling<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.940> source<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> problem

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
feeling is not the source of the problem

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.000 
feeling is not the source of the problem
it's<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.550> stuff<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.090> can't<00:00:39.450> feel

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's the stuff that you can't feel

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.580 
it's the stuff that you can't feel
that's<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.340> moving<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> are

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that's not moving and so what you are

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
that's not moving and so what you are
feeling<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.579> parts<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> body<00:00:45.329> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
feeling are the parts of the body that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
feeling are the parts of the body that
are<00:00:45.989> compensating<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> parts<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
are compensating for the parts that you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.260 
are compensating for the parts that you
can't<00:00:47.700> feel<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> RFA's<00:00:50.579> manual<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
can't feel so in the RFA's manual and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.860 
can't feel so in the RFA's manual and
DVD<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.320> basically<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> method<00:00:53.579> for

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
DVD you basically have a method for

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.330 
DVD you basically have a method for
sorting<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> issue<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.160> let<00:00:56.309> me

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
sorting out that issue all right let me

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.889 
sorting out that issue all right let me
explain<00:00:56.730> what's<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> i'll<00:00:57.660> tell<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
explain what's in here and i'll tell you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.240 
explain what's in here and i'll tell you
a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.289> more<00:00:58.500> about<00:00:58.680> how<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> works

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
a little bit more about how that works

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.349 
a little bit more about how that works
as<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.850> basic<00:01:02.850> rationale<00:01:03.300> for

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
as you go so just basic rationale for

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.440 
as you go so just basic rationale for
RFA's<00:01:03.899> why<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.320> called<00:01:04.500> our<00:01:04.710> phase<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
RFA's why it's called our phase is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.700 
RFA's why it's called our phase is
because<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.320> terms<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
because we think about it in terms of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.039 
because we think about it in terms of
three<00:01:08.010> RS<00:01:09.020> mobility<00:01:10.020> Restoration<00:01:10.770> Movement

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
three RS mobility Restoration Movement

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.640 
three RS mobility Restoration Movement
re-education<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.760> injury<00:01:14.760> rehabilitation

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
re-education and injury rehabilitation

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
re-education and injury rehabilitation
so<00:01:16.650> by<00:01:16.799> reeducation<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.729> body<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> restoring

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so by reeducation the body and restoring

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
so by reeducation the body and restoring
full<00:01:19.409> ranges<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.009> motion<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.520> each<00:01:20.670> joint

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
full ranges of motion to each joint

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.749 
full ranges of motion to each joint
right<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> resolve<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.220> lot<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
right you're going to resolve a lot of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
right you're going to resolve a lot of
those<00:01:23.970> old<00:01:24.600> injuries<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.409> nagging<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
those old injuries that are nagging and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
those old injuries that are nagging and
a<00:01:26.280> lot<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> movement<00:01:27.030> problems<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.540> know

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
a lot of the movement problems you know

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
a lot of the movement problems you know
take<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.229> step<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:28.950> injury<00:01:29.310> you're

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
take it one step back from injury you're

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.219 
take it one step back from injury you're
going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> start<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> solve<00:01:30.689> movement

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
going to start to solve movement

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
going to start to solve movement
problems<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.460> naturally<00:01:33.180> leads<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
problems and that naturally leads to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.890 
problems and that naturally leads to
stronger<00:01:34.829> movement<00:01:35.280> faster<00:01:35.909> movement<00:01:36.360> more

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
stronger movement faster movement more

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.410 
stronger movement faster movement more
graceful<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.680> powerful<00:01:38.189> movement<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.119> if

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
graceful more powerful movement so if

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
graceful more powerful movement so if
you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.259> everything<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.979> terms

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you can think about everything in terms

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can think about everything in terms
of<00:01:41.520> solving<00:01:42.119> movement<00:01:42.720> problems<00:01:43.130> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
of solving movement problems this is the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
of solving movement problems this is the
fundamental<00:01:44.939> step<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.990> take

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
fundamental step that's going to take

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
fundamental step that's going to take
you<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> direction<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.220> that's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you in that direction and that's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
you in that direction and that's
especially<00:01:48.329> true<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
especially true if you don't have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
especially true if you don't have
somebody<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.159> give<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> direct<00:01:51.329> feedback<00:01:51.600> all

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
somebody to give you direct feedback all

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170 
somebody to give you direct feedback all
the<00:01:52.110> time<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.590> movement<00:01:52.950> practice<00:01:53.340> right

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the time on your movement practice right

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.340 
the time on your movement practice right
you<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.420> an<00:01:54.540> outside<00:01:54.869> set<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> eyes<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you have an outside set of eyes that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.440 
you have an outside set of eyes that
looks<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> says<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.460> they're<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.240> good

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
looks and says if they're really good

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
looks and says if they're really good
they<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> look<00:01:57.960> analytically<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> say<00:01:58.979> well

that<00:02:26.099> breaks<00:02:26.430> down<00:02:26.580> every<00:02:27.180> exercise<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that breaks down every exercise so a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.470 
that breaks down every exercise so a
model<00:02:28.830> shows<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.849> do<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> drill

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480

model shows you how to do the drill
points<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.410> key<00:02:32.160> do's<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.640> don'ts<00:02:32.970> right<00:02:33.629> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
points out key do's and don'ts right and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.690 
points out key do's and don'ts right and
so<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.260> exercises<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.099> take<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.459> head

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
so you get exercises that take you head

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.870 
so you get exercises that take you head
to<00:02:35.910> toe<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.510> move<00:02:37.319> every<00:02:37.860> single<00:02:38.250> part<00:02:38.549> that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
to toe and move every single part that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.350 
to toe and move every single part that
should<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.209> moving<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> body<00:02:40.370> right<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:42.120> do

that as part of your practice only takes

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.759 
that as part of your practice only takes
about<00:02:44.340> 10<00:02:44.760> or<00:02:44.910> 15<00:02:45.000> minutes<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:46.440> what<00:02:46.590> you're

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
about 10 or 15 minutes but what you're

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.520 
about 10 or 15 minutes but what you're
doing<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.400> taking<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.970> 10-15<00:02:48.930> minute<00:02:48.959> warm-up

good instructor who can say this is what

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.110 
good instructor who can say this is what
you<00:02:58.890> need<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> target<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.760> need<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
you need to target and you need to

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.660 
you need to target and you need to
pinpoint<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.160> think<00:03:02.340> about<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
one private lesson with a good

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.259 
one private lesson with a good
instructor<00:03:10.260> you're<00:03:11.190> getting<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:12.000> about

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
instructor you're getting actually about

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.319 
instructor you're getting actually about
six<00:03:12.959> months<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.620> training<00:03:13.889> materials<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.819> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
six months of training materials so the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.360 
six months of training materials so the
cost<00:03:15.630> per<00:03:15.989> training<00:03:16.350> such<00:03:16.530> are<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.859> value<00:03:17.190> per

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
cost per training such are the value per

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.120 
cost per training such are the value per
training<00:03:17.730> session<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.209> HUGE<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.859> pennies<00:03:19.859> for

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
training session is HUGE if pennies for

training session is HUGE if pennies for
every<00:03:20.370> training<00:03:20.609> session<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.120> you're<00:03:21.209> going

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
every training session that you're going

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.539 
every training session that you're going
to<00:03:21.389> do<00:03:21.480> over<00:03:21.720> six<00:03:21.930> months<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.190> manual

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
to do over six months and in the manual

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.400 
to do over six months and in the manual
is<00:03:23.639> actually<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> blueprint<00:03:24.569> for<00:03:24.720> how<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.079> take

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
is actually a blueprint for how you take

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.259 
is actually a blueprint for how you take
this<00:03:25.620> through<00:03:26.250> six<00:03:26.489> months<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.849> training<00:03:27.000> to

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
this through six months of training to

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.629 
this through six months of training to
master<00:03:27.480> every<00:03:27.959> drill<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.530> incorporate<00:03:29.459> these

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
master every drill and incorporate these

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.819 
master every drill and incorporate these
full<00:03:29.910> body<00:03:30.120> training<00:03:30.510> sessions<00:03:31.019> right<00:03:31.590> from

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
full body training sessions right from

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.520 
full body training sessions right from
the<00:03:31.920> beginning<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.450> you've<00:03:33.989> got<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.230> huge

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
the beginning so you've got a huge

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.339 
the beginning so you've got a huge
training<00:03:35.040> plan<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:36.109> foundational<00:03:37.109> piece

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
training plan a foundational piece

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.870 
training plan a foundational piece
because<00:03:37.739> you're<00:03:37.889> moving<00:03:38.160> everything<00:03:38.489> through

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
because you're moving everything through

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.949 
because you're moving everything through
the<00:03:38.970> body<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.510> then<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:41.190> dvds<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:42.180> will

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
the body and then the dvds here will

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.539 
the body and then the dvds here will
actually<00:03:42.989> take<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.590> through<00:03:43.889> again<00:03:44.190> there's

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
actually take you through again there's

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.520 
actually take you through again there's
one<00:03:44.609> instructional<00:03:45.389> and<00:03:46.019> then<00:03:46.169> there's<00:03:46.349> one

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
one instructional and then there's one

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.580 
one instructional and then there's one
follow<00:03:46.829> along<00:03:47.160> practice<00:03:47.669> so<00:03:48.510> basically<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> few

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
follow along practice so basically a few

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.349 
follow along practice so basically a few
minutes<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:50.010> day<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.669> can<00:03:50.790> be<00:03:50.849> going<00:03:51.209> through

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
minutes a day you can be going through

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.379
