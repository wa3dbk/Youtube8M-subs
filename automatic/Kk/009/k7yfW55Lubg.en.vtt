so maybe they won't kill him off we need

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.740 
so maybe they won't kill him off we need
to<00:01:56.320> wait<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.770> see<00:01:57.250> what<00:01:57.850> happens<00:01:58.030> next<00:01:58.390> of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
to wait and see what happens next of

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.500 
to wait and see what happens next of
course<00:01:58.930> something<00:01:59.500> else<00:02:00.190> like<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> reboot<00:02:01.240> and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
course something else like a reboot and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.930 
course something else like a reboot and
I<00:02:02.140> don't<00:02:02.200> think<00:02:02.530> we're<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.250> see<00:02:03.580> reboot

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
I don't think we're going to see reboot

film<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.010> here's<00:02:25.940> something

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
film but here's something

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.930 
film but here's something
the<00:02:27.230> amazing<00:02:27.590> experiment<00:02:27.980> -<00:02:28.070> it's<00:02:28.340> Andrews

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the amazing experiment - it's Andrews

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.290 
the amazing experiment - it's Andrews
second<00:02:29.660> film<00:02:29.900> experiment<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:31.610> while

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
second film experiment so really while

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.810 
second film experiment so really while
this<00:02:32.570> ideas<00:02:33.340> sounds<00:02:34.340> great

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
this ideas sounds great

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.330 
this ideas sounds great
it's<00:02:35.300> too<00:02:35.600> early<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.170> mean<00:02:36.380> Andrew<00:02:36.830> should<00:02:37.130> do

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
it's too early I mean Andrew should do

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.310 
it's too early I mean Andrew should do
the<00:02:37.460> amazing<00:02:37.760> spider-man<00:02:38.060> 3<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.540> then<00:02:38.810> he

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the amazing spider-man 3 and then he

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.170 
the amazing spider-man 3 and then he
will<00:02:39.530> probably<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.520> amazing<00:02:40.700> spider-man

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
will probably do the amazing spider-man

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840 
will probably do the amazing spider-man
4<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.600> mean<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.960> guy<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.170> huge<00:02:42.800> Batman<00:02:43.130> fan<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
4 I mean the guy is huge Batman fan and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.420 
4 I mean the guy is huge Batman fan and
then<00:02:44.360> there<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.660> paycheck<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.410> then<00:02:45.770> there

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
then there is a paycheck and then there

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670 
then there is a paycheck and then there
are<00:02:46.460> other<00:02:47.330> things<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:48.260> might<00:02:48.440> eventually

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
are other things that might eventually

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.980 
are other things that might eventually
change<00:02:49.280> his<00:02:49.580> mind<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.240> he<00:02:50.510> will<00:02:50.630> actually

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
change his mind and he will actually

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.260 
change his mind and he will actually
renew<00:02:51.380> his<00:02:51.560> contract<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.310> will<00:02:52.910> actually

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
renew his contract and will actually

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.240 
renew his contract and will actually
play<00:02:53.450> spider-man<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.290> at<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.740> point<00:02:55.010> it's

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
play spider-man so at this point it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.880 
play spider-man so at this point it's
too<00:02:55.670> early<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:57.050> all<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.380> fantasies

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
too early to to do all the fantasies

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.800 
too early to to do all the fantasies
about<00:02:58.070> Miles<00:02:58.610> Morales<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.240> of<00:02:59.390> course<00:02:59.630> at

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
about Miles Morales but of course at

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.430 
about Miles Morales but of course at
some<00:03:00.020> point

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
some point

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.560 
some point
Andrew<00:03:00.800> will<00:03:01.010> give<00:03:01.280> up<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.640> being<00:03:01.910> experiment

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
Andrew will give up a being experiment

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.450 
Andrew will give up a being experiment
and<00:03:02.810> then<00:03:02.960> we<00:03:03.110> need<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.440> see<00:03:03.650> something<00:03:04.040> else

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
and then we need to see something else

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.790 
and then we need to see something else
and<00:03:04.850> then<00:03:05.270> again<00:03:05.540> Andrew<00:03:06.080> Garfield<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.620> be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
and then again Andrew Garfield can be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.320 
and then again Andrew Garfield can be
spider-man<00:03:07.220> even<00:03:07.610> after<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.000> amazing
