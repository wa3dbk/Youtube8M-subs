00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
about a half a lap behind so I guess in

about a half a lap behind so I guess in
one<00:02:13.709> sense<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.220> good<00:02:14.459> for<00:02:14.640> them<00:02:14.760> 20<00:02:15.299> cars

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569

of the field as you can see the car was

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.890 
of the field as you can see the car was
loose<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.150> they<00:02:39.239> were<00:02:39.329> trying<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.660> bash

apparently<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.790> was<00:02:44.910> even<00:02:45.180> looser<00:02:45.570> than<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
apparently it was even looser than it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.780 
apparently it was even looser than it
was<00:02:45.989> before<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.859> of<00:02:47.250> course<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.519> was<00:02:47.609> more

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
was before and of course it was more

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.220 
was before and of course it was more
than<00:02:47.910> Shepard<00:02:48.269> had<00:02:48.390> had<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.690> spin<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.140> we're

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
than Shepard had had that spin and we're

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.750

waiting<00:02:49.410> him<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.769> come<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.100> now<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.609> not<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
waiting him to come in now so it's not a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550 
waiting him to come in now so it's not a
good<00:02:51.000> time<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.299> interview<00:02:51.690> Leonard<00:02:52.109> himself

now<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.209> lap<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:57.810> 140<00:02:58.530> odd<00:02:59.120> obviously<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
now on lap what 140 odd obviously it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.289 
now on lap what 140 odd obviously it
can't<00:03:00.359> go<00:03:00.480> quite<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.139> end<00:03:01.319> still<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:03.180> be

can't go quite to the end still but be
interesting<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.720> see<00:03:03.930> how<00:03:04.109> many<00:03:04.319> cars<00:03:04.620> stop

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

interesting to see how many cars stop
now<00:03:05.250> those<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.090> stopped<00:03:06.359> have<00:03:06.660> only<00:03:06.840> need

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
now those that stopped have only need

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.900 
now those that stopped have only need
new<00:03:07.260> adjustments<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.190> forth<00:03:08.519> other<00:03:08.819> than

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
new adjustments and so forth other than

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.849 
new adjustments and so forth other than
we<00:03:09.030> take<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.420> gas<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.170> take<00:03:10.319> advantage<00:03:10.769> of

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
we take on gas just to take advantage of

the<00:03:10.980> delay<00:03:11.130> probably<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.209> Chris<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.750> was

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
the delay probably so and Chris this was

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.720 
the delay probably so and Chris this was
a<00:03:13.019> major<00:03:13.290> break<00:03:13.650> for<00:03:13.859> Bill<00:03:13.980> Elliott<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.519> seen
