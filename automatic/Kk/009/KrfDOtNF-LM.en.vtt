encyclopedia of origami so starting with
the<00:00:17.460> same<00:00:17.760> base<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.660> our<00:00:19.529> five<00:00:19.830> pointed<00:00:20.369> star

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
the same base as our five pointed star

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.460 
the same base as our five pointed star
we<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> narrow<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.380> making<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
we are going to narrow it making a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.810 
we are going to narrow it making a
slender<00:00:26.039> by<00:00:26.699> folding<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.480> edge<00:00:28.789> into<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
slender by folding this edge into the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.150 
slender by folding this edge into the
center<00:00:32.120> fold<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.360> edge<00:00:33.630> into<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> center

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.340 

and<00:00:39.260> same<00:00:40.260> thing<00:00:40.790> with<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.090> oh<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:43.140> sorry

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and same thing with this oh I'm sorry

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.000 
and same thing with this oh I'm sorry
forgot<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.129> step<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:45.090> raw<00:00:45.420> edge<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.440> we

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
forgot one step this raw edge up here we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.850 
forgot one step this raw edge up here we
are<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.610> fold<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.590> meets

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
are going to fold down so that it meets

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.600 
are going to fold down so that it meets
this<00:00:50.579> crease<00:00:51.030> right<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:54.890> fold<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> down<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this crease right here fold it down and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.740 
this crease right here fold it down and
then<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.800> narrow<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.750> by

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
then we are going to narrow it by

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.359 
then we are going to narrow it by
folding<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.770> edge<00:01:02.449> into<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.480> center<00:01:06.170> and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
folding this edge into the center and

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.179 
folding this edge into the center and
you<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.549> notice<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:10.280> top<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:13.040> that<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you will notice on top there that you

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640 
you will notice on top there that you
have<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.610> extra<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.299> flap<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:16.080> fold<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
have this extra little flap just fold it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.730 
have this extra little flap just fold it
over<00:01:18.259> along<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.470> edge<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.750> then<00:01:21.750> tuck<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
over along this edge and then tuck it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.140 
over along this edge and then tuck it
underneath<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.430> between<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.570> two<00:01:24.780> layers<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
underneath in between the two layers and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.560 
underneath in between the two layers and
then<00:01:27.150> proceed<00:01:27.619> with<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> same<00:01:29.180> steps<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.450> we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
then proceed with the same steps that we

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.950 
then proceed with the same steps that we
had<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> regular<00:01:33.150> five<00:01:33.570> pointed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
had in the for the regular five pointed

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.370 
had in the for the regular five pointed
star<00:01:34.070> turn<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> unit<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> other<00:01:35.850> side

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
star turn the unit to the other side

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.520 
star turn the unit to the other side
fold<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.619> along<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.250> existing<00:01:38.549> crease<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
fold it along the existing crease and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:52.279 
fold it along the existing crease and
then<00:01:43.040> fold<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:46.189> horizontally<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:48.590> that

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.090 

so<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.530> this<00:01:54.280> edge<00:01:54.810> ideally<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:56.740> edge

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
so that this edge ideally this edge

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.289 
so that this edge ideally this edge
ideally<00:01:57.999> would<00:01:58.179> meet<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.049> edge<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
ideally would meet up with this edge and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.490 
ideally would meet up with this edge and
there<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.689> here<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.649> 0<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.329> then<00:02:07.719> Valley<00:02:08.019> fold

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
there it here is 0 and then Valley fold

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.519 
there it here is 0 and then Valley fold
it<00:02:08.709> down<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.310> middle
