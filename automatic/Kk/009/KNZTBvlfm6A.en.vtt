00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.930
 3 marco will be here as you can see that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.000
 can from my 40th 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.570
 and I think we have ourselves 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.820
 exceeded 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.480
 again , especially here you have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.609
 Seen there has the full version of Kenya 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 Woman is determined and roleplaying 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.680
 bang or the absolute scarce as well 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 say because there is also about that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.220
 one actually wanted to prove that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 the rating of the gamestar next to it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.429
 So write as usual we do 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.679
 but unfortunately it is the pressure 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.200
 unfortunately not lost this time 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.130
 The good game is really but I am 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.600
 sure it's a blast 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.460
 I think it should be bang too 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.579
 but we have, we have but of course 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.750
 great theme book here plays xxl know 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.760
 you actually what the screen before 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.920
 background is still in poland 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 Play or he could almost do it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 think but I have one on one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.710
 mailserver looked and it is call of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.270
 Duty no longer recognizes the layout 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 also has here as you can see there 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.239
 beautiful clouds are not presented the game 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.770
 It looks more like running away 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 run away developers on the right and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.270
 info kfw of course sees an ultra hd 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.869
 really everything is great from the show we 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.100
 special to them 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.250
 Look what else you can do 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 have ever been 149 issues and no 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 a little tired 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 there you can see a picture of very good and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
 here's you in this photo 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.159
 or made that I am complete 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.759
 switched here in a two 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.740
 watch TV 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.240
 what is not sid I 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.250
 actually a gamepad in hand and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.750
 shows just what you can do with it 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 somehow lost behind my berner 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.409
 but it's just like your colleagues 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.609
 made 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.950
 I'm still missing something cooling off 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.600
 the strawberry juice succeeded especially this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.850
 points in the vote so who looks or 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.799
 yes it reminds me of articles 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.539
 will be tested as the requirements of 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.159
 So games are really for example 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.310
 manufacturers write something on it 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.140
 partly nvidia radeon 5800 and he this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.569
 displayed then what really needed 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.340
 becomes 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.810
 Game excel format is one of my 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.909
 absolute favorite actually this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.330
 task especially the comparison pc 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.530
 against control over there you can see that 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.000
 not so fair because if you have it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.129
 So seen in companies consoles they 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 really really bad and out 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.010
 So do not compare sometimes as a 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.840
 a bit but to run away to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.170
 run away 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.299
 That's why we prefer not to play here 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.329
 looks like that is daniel that is 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.060
 my favorite was finished is super trophy 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.540
 yes synonymous as it comes to the size 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.459
 on it 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.590
 Oh yes, I already have 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.940
 I read somewhere I believe writes 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.900
 colleague in every second or third 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.159
 article why 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.159
 probably funny 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.770
 radio and makes glad finally understood 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.600
 have tried his keys 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.490
 editor tried what can still 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.750
 bring einspruch what is the lektorat 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.030
 filtered out and what does it do 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.740
 Actually recipe would be quite 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:16.350
 strange talk where one has too 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:16.350
 it was about time 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.820
 Becker was good that not everything 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.520
 shows 70 cpu it is 70 to her 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.390
 on an absolute favorite article 50 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.320
 determined I think the concerts of 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.880
 Company who does not brake 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.670
 That's why our dear market is 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.760
 namely the master of excel tables 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.280
 So at what you see here have 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.840
 I also believe five editors 25 days 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.160
 the heads are about plugged together 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 so it looked like it looks like this 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 but that was even worse 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.280
 this graphic will tell you its origin and 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.650
 that are always growing and 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.100
 is this super mega info bomb 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.100
 become 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.110
 an absolute darling daniel was 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.140
 the fan articles 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.959
 that's the ofc gigabyte and it was 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.519
 not so easy because we have the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.540
 colleagues from gigabyte asked that one 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.340
 the option mean 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.480
 He then came something out there at times 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.630
 prepared here, for example, asked 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.990
 which means cora wanted chris pons came 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:42.640
 as an answer the fact that i'm taking to 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:48.880
 respond you could say yes what 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.610
 actually only one option is this 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.850
 value indicates how long it will take to 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.950
 the one initiated by the cdu around the 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.810
 Reliable June values ​​change 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.960
 I'm supposed to implement that 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.270
 I also thought about where the drops are 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.770
 namely the test lead because you have 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.330
 namely said so and test lead 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.750
 he is responsible for that inters top 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.750
 cleaned up 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.330
 this is really a big issue 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.330
 this time yes my absolute liebzell
