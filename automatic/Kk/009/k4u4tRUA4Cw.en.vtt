standard<00:00:42.460> with<00:00:42.699> Windows<00:00:43.120> XP<00:00:43.269> you<00:00:43.660> don't<00:00:43.809> have

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
standard with Windows XP you don't have

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.819 
standard with Windows XP you don't have
to<00:00:44.050> buy<00:00:44.199> anything<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.550> first<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:46.000> all<00:00:46.170> we'll<00:00:47.170> go

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
to buy anything so first of all we'll go

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.889 
to buy anything so first of all we'll go
into<00:00:48.010> save<00:00:48.370> as<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:49.239> we'll<00:00:49.449> change<00:00:49.690> the

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
into save as and we'll change the

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.049 
into save as and we'll change the
properties<00:00:50.379> of<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.530> file<00:00:50.859> you<00:00:51.190> want<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
properties of the file you want the

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.750 
properties of the file you want the
right<00:00:52.269> kind<00:00:52.539> of<00:00:52.600> file<00:00:52.839> to<00:00:53.109> record<00:00:53.530> onto<00:00:54.219> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
right kind of file to record onto the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.180 
right kind of file to record onto the
computer<00:00:55.179> so<00:00:55.359> we<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.600> burn<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.839> CD<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.440> that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
computer so we can burn a CD and that

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.009 
computer so we can burn a CD and that
kind<00:00:57.429> of<00:00:57.489> file<00:00:57.760> would<00:00:58.570> be<00:00:59.399> 44.1<00:01:00.809> 16-bit<00:01:01.809> stereo

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
kind of file would be 44.1 16-bit stereo

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.140 
kind of file would be 44.1 16-bit stereo
so<00:01:02.859> we<00:01:02.980> go<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:04.199> format<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.729> click<00:01:06.970> on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
so we go to that format you click on

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.800 
so we go to that format you click on
that<00:01:07.260> we'll<00:01:08.260> hit<00:01:08.380> OK<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.300> then<00:01:10.300> we<00:01:10.450> name<00:01:10.630> the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
that we'll hit OK and then we name the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.600 
that we'll hit OK and then we name the
song<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:13.170> save<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.740> then<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.250> turn<00:01:15.460> on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
song and then save and then we turn on

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.580 
song and then save and then we turn on
the<00:01:15.790> turntable<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.540> get<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.020> record

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
the turntable and get the record

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.469

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
okay it looks like it's happening after

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.670 
okay it looks like it's happening after
you're<00:01:27.320> done<00:01:27.789> recording<00:01:29.409> you'll<00:01:30.409> hit<00:01:30.619> the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680

you're done recording you'll hit the
stop<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:33.649> then<00:01:33.950> what<00:01:34.729> we'll<00:01:34.880> do<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.210> we'll

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
stop and then what we'll do is we'll

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.169 
stop and then what we'll do is we'll
verify<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.320> files<00:01:37.250> recorded<00:01:38.000> we'll

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
verify that the files recorded we'll

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.570 
verify that the files recorded we'll
just<00:01:38.390> play<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.649> there<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.070> right<00:01:40.280> there

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
just play it and there it is right there

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.300 
just play it and there it is right there
and<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.539> playing<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:41.990> did<00:01:42.140> record<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.619> okay

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310
