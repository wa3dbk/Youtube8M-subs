00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
in her that you believe that she can

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.660 
in her that you believe that she can
make<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.290> she<00:02:41.770> doesn't<00:02:41.920> know<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.430> you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670

her<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:46.180> think<00:02:46.510> about<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:46.960> baseball

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
her so think about it like baseball

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
ball is not getting into that hole

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.810 
ball is not getting into that hole
without<00:02:55.510> completing<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.860> swing<00:02:57.190> not<00:02:57.670> that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
without completing the swing not that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.580

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
I'm a golfer or a baseball player but

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.680
