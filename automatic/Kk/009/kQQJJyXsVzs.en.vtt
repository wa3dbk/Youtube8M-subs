00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
skates even so it's not just the stick
it<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.280> goes<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.729> case<00:01:44.880> watch

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it actually goes through this case watch

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
it actually goes through this case watch
the<00:01:45.299> stick<00:01:45.509> lift<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.920> goes<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.250> back

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the stick lift and it goes right back

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.819 
the stick lift and it goes right back
down<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> puck<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.560> know

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
down to the puck which is I don't know

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
down to the puck which is I don't know
I<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> poke<00:01:50.430> check<00:01:50.520> should<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.509> stick

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I think the poke check should the stick

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.179 
I think the poke check should the stick
lift<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.170> grow<00:01:52.380> right<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> puck

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
lift could grow right down to the puck

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
lift could grow right down to the puck
but<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> poke<00:01:53.909> check<00:01:54.000> could<00:01:54.299> should<00:01:54.780> shove<00:01:55.049> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
but the poke check could should shove it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
but the poke check could should shove it
away<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.920> puck<00:01:56.100> shouldn't<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.490> going

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
away and the puck shouldn't be going

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.280 
away and the puck shouldn't be going
through<00:01:56.790> skates<00:01:57.180> either<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
through skates either right and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510 
through skates either right and
obviously<00:01:58.680> he's<00:01:58.829> gonna<00:01:58.920> score<00:01:59.219> when<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
obviously he's gonna score when that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
obviously he's gonna score when that
happens<00:01:59.939> cuz<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.479> what<00:02:00.659> happens

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
happens cuz that's just what happens

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.630 
happens cuz that's just what happens
like<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.799> screwed<00:02:02.189> you're<00:02:02.369> gonna<00:02:02.460> get

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
like if you get screwed you're gonna get

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.840 
like if you get screwed you're gonna get
lit<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.500> out<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.070> guy<00:02:05.219> dangles<00:02:05.610> around

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
lit now out here this guy dangles around

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.880 
lit now out here this guy dangles around
for<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.299> then

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
for a bit and then

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.650 
for a bit and then
I<00:02:06.950> poke<00:02:07.490> check<00:02:07.550> him<00:02:07.790> out<00:02:07.880> here<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:08.420> then<00:02:08.539> he's

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
I poke check him out here and then he's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.690 
I poke check him out here and then he's
coming<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:09.080> again<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.130> poke<00:02:10.340> check<00:02:10.429> him

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
coming in again and I poke check him

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.300 
coming in again and I poke check him
twice<00:02:10.940> when<00:02:11.209> he<00:02:11.240> gets<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:11.630> close<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.680> think

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
twice when he gets in close I just think

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.670 
twice when he gets in close I just think
that<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.150> your<00:02:14.330> stick<00:02:14.630> hits<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> puck<00:02:15.319> it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that if your stick hits the puck it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.460 
that if your stick hits the puck it
should<00:02:15.980> poke<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.520> puck<00:02:16.760> away<00:02:16.970> look<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.200> does

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
should poke the puck away look it does

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.140 
should poke the puck away look it does
touch<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.010> puck<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.670> goes<00:02:19.790> right<00:02:19.910> back<00:02:20.090> to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
touch the puck but it goes right back to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.710 
touch the puck but it goes right back to
him

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
him

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.410 
him
the<00:02:21.170> poke<00:02:21.470> value<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.280> not<00:02:22.459> far<00:02:22.730> enough<00:02:22.880> it's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
the poke value is not far enough it's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.880 
the poke value is not far enough it's
not<00:02:23.570> far<00:02:23.780> enough<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.320> should<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.709> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
not far enough you should have to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.040 
not far enough you should have to
protect<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> puck<00:02:25.640> better<00:02:25.940> rather<00:02:26.570> than<00:02:26.840> just

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
protect the puck better rather than just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.690 
protect the puck better rather than just
skate<00:02:27.350> right<00:02:27.560> through<00:02:27.800> guys<00:02:28.010> watch<00:02:28.490> this

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
skate right through guys watch this

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.699 
skate right through guys watch this
again<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.180> slow-mo<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.870> don't<00:02:30.230> know<00:02:30.320> maybe<00:02:30.560> you

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
again in slow-mo I don't know maybe you

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.260 
again in slow-mo I don't know maybe you
guys<00:02:30.830> don't<00:02:31.100> agree<00:02:31.190> with<00:02:31.430> me<00:02:31.610> maybe<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.030> think

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
guys don't agree with me maybe you think

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.060 
guys don't agree with me maybe you think
the<00:02:32.390> poke<00:02:32.570> check<00:02:32.660> would<00:02:32.959> be<00:02:33.020> too<00:02:33.320> overpowered

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
the poke check would be too overpowered

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.010 
the poke check would be too overpowered
but<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.820> find<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.930> most

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
but I find this to be the most

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.830 
but I find this to be the most
frustrating<00:02:36.410> part<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.310> NHL<00:02:37.730> 15<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.330> can't<00:02:38.690> get

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
frustrating part of NHL 15 I can't get

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.350 
frustrating part of NHL 15 I can't get
the<00:02:38.930> puck<00:02:39.170> away<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.770> can't<00:02:40.250> get<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.580> away<00:02:40.670> look

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
the puck away I can't get it away look

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.479 
the puck away I can't get it away look
at<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.600> I've<00:02:41.810> done<00:02:41.870> everything<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.620> could<00:02:42.680> let

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
at this I've done everything I could let

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.030 
at this I've done everything I could let
me<00:02:43.580> know<00:02:43.670> what<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.910> guys<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.040> we'll
