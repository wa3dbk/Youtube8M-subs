00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.560 
wanted to get more of a clicky bass drum
sound<00:01:30.140> but<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.800> read<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.310> most<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.360> is

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
sound but I read that most of that is

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.440 
sound but I read that most of that is
done<00:01:32.780> with<00:01:32.960> triggers<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.130> what<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.280> did<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.700> I

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
done with triggers so what I did is I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.510 
done with triggers so what I did is I
have<00:01:35.869> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
have the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.830 
have the
big<00:01:38.119> beefy<00:01:38.750> ones<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.259> I<00:01:40.130> cut<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.539> foam

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
big beefy ones and I cut the the foam

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.609 
big beefy ones and I cut the the foam
parts<00:01:42.850> off<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.909> them<00:01:44.359> and<00:01:44.509> makes<00:01:45.259> them<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.439> lot

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
parts off of them and makes them a lot

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.499 
parts off of them and makes them a lot
lighter<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.189> can<00:01:46.310> go<00:01:46.520> go<00:01:46.880> quicker<00:01:47.210> and

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
lighter so you can go go quicker and

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.850 
lighter so you can go go quicker and
also<00:01:47.750> behind<00:01:48.350> my<00:01:49.210> kick<00:01:50.210> patch<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.899> have<00:01:51.500> two

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
quarters so that sort of gives it a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.399 
quarters so that sort of gives it a
little<00:01:54.740> bit<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.100> clicky<00:01:55.759> type<00:01:56.299> sound<00:01:56.630> so
