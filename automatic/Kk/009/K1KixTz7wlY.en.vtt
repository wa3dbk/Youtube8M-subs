getting a tow from a long way back is
such<00:00:42.140> an<00:00:42.289> important<00:00:42.679> part<00:00:42.800> but<00:00:43.219> as<00:00:43.309> we<00:00:43.489> saw<00:00:43.670> in

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
such an important part but as we saw in

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.520 
such an important part but as we saw in
the<00:00:43.850> previous<00:00:44.239> race<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.170> can<00:00:45.289> get<00:00:45.410> the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the previous race you can get the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.900 
the previous race you can get the
slipstream<00:00:46.039> but<00:00:46.219> there's<00:00:46.370> nowhere<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.789> go

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
slipstream but there's nowhere to go

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.819 
slipstream but there's nowhere to go
tend<00:00:47.449> to<00:00:47.510> be<00:00:47.600> three<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:47.960> four<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.170> five<00:00:48.350> wide

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
tend to be three and four and five wide

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.290 
tend to be three and four and five wide
as<00:00:49.039> they<00:00:49.159> go<00:00:49.280> up<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.579> down<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.850> mountain<00:00:50.149> here

car the drag is far less so if you're

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.410 
horsepower on these sixteen hundred cars
so<00:03:18.320> obviously<00:03:19.100> they<00:03:19.250> they<00:03:19.700> set<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.030> gear

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
so obviously they they set the gear

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420 
so obviously they they set the gear
ratio<00:03:20.600> up<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.110> make<00:03:21.560> sure<00:03:21.740> that<00:03:21.950> they<00:03:22.070> get<00:03:22.250> to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
ratio up to make sure that they get to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.800 
ratio up to make sure that they get to
that<00:03:22.520> maximum<00:03:23.030> at<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.570> end<00:03:23.780> stroke

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
that maximum at the end stroke

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.229 
that maximum at the end stroke
70<00:03:25.800> horsepower<00:03:26.099> little<00:03:26.610> different<00:03:27.000> from<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
70 horsepower little different from the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.850 
70 horsepower little different from the
1200<00:03:27.780> c<00:03:27.930> said<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.349> would<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.590> run<00:03:28.739> you

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
1200 c said that you would have run you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.809 
1200 c said that you would have run you
wouldn't<00:03:29.069> have<00:03:29.160> know<00:03:29.280> what<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.550> do<00:03:29.700> with

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
wouldn't have know what to do with

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.910 
wouldn't have know what to do with
yourself<00:03:30.050> 70<00:03:31.050> horsepower<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.560> used<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.800> have

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
yourself 70 horsepower we used to have

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.100 
yourself 70 horsepower we used to have
about<00:03:31.950> thirty<00:03:32.370> six<00:03:32.670> horse<00:03:32.849> power<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.870> good

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
about thirty six horse power of a good

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.960 
about thirty six horse power of a good
engine<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.650> yeah<00:03:35.160> obviously<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.580> completely

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
engine so yeah obviously a completely

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.820

change in the last couple of years but

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.350
