00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.210 
four and four is pretty much almost
never<00:02:41.370> most<00:02:41.790> likely<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.239> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> pass<00:02:42.690> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
never most likely not going to pass and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.030 
never most likely not going to pass and
then<00:02:44.220> each<00:02:44.430> player<00:02:44.670> now<00:02:45.120> will<00:02:45.480> start<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:45.810> two

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
then each player now will start with two

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.540 
then each player now will start with two
items<00:02:47.870> randomly<00:02:48.870> picked<00:02:49.110> from<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.410> pile<00:02:49.650> tiles

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
items randomly picked from a pile tiles

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.550 
items randomly picked from a pile tiles
that<00:02:50.820> are<00:02:50.880> laid<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> board<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
that are laid out in the board here and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
that are laid out in the board here and
then<00:02:53.600> you're<00:02:54.600> going<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.870> roll<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> die<00:02:56.209> three<00:02:57.209> is

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
then you're going to roll a die three is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600 
then you're going to roll a die three is
where<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.769> player<00:02:59.069> is<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.489> be

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
where this player is going to be

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.750 
where this player is going to be
starting<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.540> room<00:03:01.280> green<00:03:02.280> will<00:03:02.519> start

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
starting it that room green will start

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.370 
starting it that room green will start
out<00:03:02.880> at<00:03:03.000> 1<00:03:03.269> 0<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.750> 1<00:03:05.630> sorry<00:03:06.630> my<00:03:06.750> board<00:03:07.019> kind<00:03:07.319> of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
on different rooms okay now on to turn

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.170 
on different rooms okay now on to turn
phase<00:03:18.620> we're<00:03:19.620> gonna<00:03:19.709> take<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> little<00:03:20.400> step

closer okay
now<00:03:24.630> first<00:03:25.049> thing<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.290> want<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.950> put

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
now first thing you want to do is put

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.030 
now first thing you want to do is put
six<00:03:26.700> grog<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.570> take<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> Kraken<00:03:28.920> out

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
six grog there and take the Kraken out

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.039 
six grog there and take the Kraken out
he<00:03:29.310> gets<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.760> back<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.450> pile<00:03:30.630> once<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:33.049> once

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
he gets in back in the pile once it once

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.960 
he gets in back in the pile once it once
this<00:03:34.320> pile<00:03:34.739> exploits<00:03:35.370> itself<00:03:35.730> then<00:03:35.940> you

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
this pile exploits itself then you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.940 
this pile exploits itself then you
shuffle<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.510> randomly<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.470> now<00:03:37.620> this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
shuffle it randomly so now this

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.850 
shuffle it randomly so now this
concludes<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.670> setup<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.470> you're<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:40.829> to

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
concludes the setup so you're going to

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.319 
concludes the setup so you're going to
view<00:03:40.980> all<00:03:41.280> your<00:03:41.430> different<00:03:41.670> tokens<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:42.150> is

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
view all your different tokens this is

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.520 
view all your different tokens this is
fire<00:03:43.220> water<00:03:44.220> tokens<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.000> hash<00:03:45.930> tokens<00:03:46.410> with

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
fire water tokens and hash tokens with

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.599 
fire water tokens and hash tokens with
your<00:03:46.620> block<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.579> concludes<00:03:48.030> setup<00:03:49.609> so

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
your block so this concludes setup so

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.819 
your block so this concludes setup so
next<00:03:51.420> setup<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.900> going<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.410> play<00:03:52.590> which

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
next setup is going to be in play which

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.830 
next setup is going to be in play which
I'm<00:03:52.950> going<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.160> take<00:03:53.400> my<00:03:53.579> next<00:03:53.790> video<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.269> part

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
I'm going to take my next video so part

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.100 
I'm going to take my next video so part
two<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.260> how<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.859> play
