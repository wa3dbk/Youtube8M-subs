00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.300
 how to make a dog vomit 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 this can be a saving measure in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.339
 case of poisoning or ingestion of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.339
 small objects 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.940
 the purpose of limiting a dog 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.119
 is to expel poisons from the stomach 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.680
 drugs drugs small objects 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.780
 engineers accidentally 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.780
 there are three ways to make a round tea 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.109
 first by using coarse salt 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.320
 has a tablespoon of coarse salt 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:48.640
 cook in half a cup of warm water and 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 make her take the dog 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.560
 second by means of hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.340
 common of 10 volumes of the first aid kit 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.340
 she 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.920
 you have to make pure take a spoonful 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.640
 trough of hydrogen peroxide in the case of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.460
 dogs, guys 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 and two tablespoons for both 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.890
 places 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.680
 third by means of sea water 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.580
 undiluted sea water collected from 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 any beach 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.149
 give half a glass of sea water this is what 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.909
 ideal since seawater that does not 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.280
 only induces vomiting but 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.579
 also neutralizes the effect of many 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 Poisons do not prevent and protect mucous membranes 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.560
 of the digestion tube 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.300
 if in ten minutes the dog does not vomit it 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 you can repeat the same dose once more 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.920
 of any of these three substances 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.500
 if in fifteen minutes it does not vomit 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.830
 you must take the dog immediately to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.830
 vet 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 very important precautions 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.290
 vomiting can only be caused if the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.290
 animal is totally conscious 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.909
 proceed only if the ingestion of 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.909
 poisons has happened a few minutes before 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 It is forbidden to cause vomiting if the 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:34.069
 dog has ingested caustic irritants 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.069
 sharp objects or ground glass 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.310
 Do not induce vomiting if it has already passed 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.670
 one hour or more of ingesting the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.670
 poison 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.280
 Do not induce vomiting if the dog has 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.280
 difficulty breathing 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.410
 Always supply any of these 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.890
 substances with the dog standing or sitting 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.770
 never lying down 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.180
