00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.260
 hello my friends, your career 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.570
 Ministry 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.880
 everybody knows there's a Russian ship 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.300
 fell towards the earth 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.999
 There are a lot of people in the news and 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.070
 they sent video links of people 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.140
 desperate talking my god my god 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.749
 is falling on note that in our 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.530
 My God, my head will send everyone. 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:36.650
 calm down, calm down, no danger 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.170
 the Russian spacecraft falling in 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.890
 toward our plan is good but stay 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.200
 tranquil 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.470
 it does not pose any danger to the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.410
 probably is that the Russian ship 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.810
 uncontrolled is to be disintegrated when 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.400
 re-enter the atmosphere 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.370
 terrestrial 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.200
 the unmanned spacecraft progress 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.570
 carrying groceries to the station 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.330
 spatial planning began to 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.100
 spinning wildly after your 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.619
 in orbit is falling on 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.170
 direction to earth, but rest assured that 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.929
 possibility of causing damage is 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.229
 quite remote the rocket dreams that 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.079
 led ship progress m 27 was released on 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.039
 Tuesday but the communications were 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.460
 requested 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.530
 shortly afterwards it is impossible to say when 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.229
 exactly will fall on earth 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.740
 it depends on many factors said 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.880
 space station in Russia almost 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.490
 the totality of space agencies 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.590
 of this kind disintegrated if before in the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.090
 its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.579
 even if they do not completely adhere to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.950
 its fragments usually fall into 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.600
 oceans occupying most of the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.810
 terrestrial surface 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.829
 I'm calm, leaving is not going to fall 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.549
 no one's house 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:02.479
 It sure was at night now. 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.929
 someone will shoot it and will play in 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.470
 internet talking man is some ship 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:12.590
 extraterrestrial as has already happened there 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 and I believe that many things happen 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.769
 times 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 sometimes it's just space junk only 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.040
 that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:27.420
 thank you to the next video where the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:35.970
 that went away that old 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:37.879
 I believed in myself though that he 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:47.150
 crazy old man 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:47.150
 we humans that face butt will fall 2 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.860
 the side that I'll leave everything good, good name 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.040
 license is a super fan and I tire of the channel 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.200
 online they came and as soon as I 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.590
 watch her first son in 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.030
 if it was one of the ten lost places 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.420
 in audience 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 James had both the video which is more 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.440
 strange I can say with all the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.710
 sure that they are all like this 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.350
 but in three of these two favorites are the 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.890
 Unexplained simpsons 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.810
 the 10 places on the wall and one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.770
 if people are good only it will be a 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.770
 writer with 10
