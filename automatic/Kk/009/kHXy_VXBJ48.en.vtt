up here but you know what I didn't send

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
up here but you know what I didn't send
it<00:00:54.120> quite<00:00:54.390> fast<00:00:54.629> enough<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:56.100> better<00:00:56.399> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it quite fast enough and it's better in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
it quite fast enough and it's better in
my<00:00:56.820> opinion<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.260> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
my opinion to just get it down when it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.810 
my opinion to just get it down when it
should<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.739> down<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.100> opposed<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> getting<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
should go down as opposed to getting it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
should go down as opposed to getting it
in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> right<00:01:00.030> placement<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.809> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
in the right placement up here so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
in the right placement up here so
especially<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.980> there's<00:01:02.129> no<00:01:02.280> Zerg<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
especially because there's no Zerg so I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
especially because there's no Zerg so I
just<00:01:03.270> threw<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.049> why<00:01:04.170> it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
just threw it down there that's why it's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.950 
just threw it down there that's why it's
a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.470> bit<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> position<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.150> dope

holy crap so then I decided to put a
bunker<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.259> right<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.430> again<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
bunker down right here which again is

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
bunker down right here which again is
horrible<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.840> best<00:02:01.159> for<00:02:02.159> any<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> you

horrible the best for any of you
watching<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.060> bunker<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.680> better

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
watching a bunker here much better

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
watching a bunker here much better
actually<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.280> bunker<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.119> it's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
actually a bunker here and here it's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.809 
actually a bunker here and here it's
kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> go<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.829> ultra<00:02:08.700> my

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
kind of the way to go I do ultra my

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.979 
kind of the way to go I do ultra my
build<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.660> i'll<00:02:09.780> talk<00:02:09.959> about

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
build a little bit and i'll talk about

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.140 
build a little bit and i'll talk about
this<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> second<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:11.819> see

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this just for a second so you can see

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
this just for a second so you can see
that<00:02:12.390> i<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.900> not

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that i have not

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.410 
that i have not
gotten<00:02:14.010> my<00:02:14.340> orbital<00:02:14.730> command<00:02:15.000> yet<00:02:15.239> and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
gotten my orbital command yet and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.789 
gotten my orbital command yet and
instead<00:02:15.689> I<00:02:15.719> threw<00:02:15.959> down<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.109> second<00:02:16.530> barracks

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
instead I threw down a second barracks

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.470 
instead I threw down a second barracks
the<00:02:17.310> reason<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.790> did<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.299> now<00:02:18.359> i'm

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the reason that I did that and now i'm

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.699 
the reason that I did that and now i'm
getting<00:02:18.750> my<00:02:18.810> orbital<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.319> i<00:02:19.409> might<00:02:19.590> have

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
getting my orbital and i might have

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.720 
getting my orbital and i might have
actually<00:02:19.829> wanted<00:02:20.159> to<00:02:20.219> throw<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.519> third

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
actually wanted to throw it on a third

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.220 
actually wanted to throw it on a third
barracks<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.599> reason<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.930> did<00:02:22.079> that<00:02:22.109> is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
barracks but the reason I did that is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.050 
barracks but the reason I did that is
because<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.620> wanted<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.069> get<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.400> more<00:02:23.430> units

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
because I wanted to get out more units

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.399 
because I wanted to get out more units
and<00:02:24.239> have<00:02:24.359> more<00:02:24.510> unit<00:02:24.750> producing<00:02:25.049> structures

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
and have more unit producing structures

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.099 
and have more unit producing structures
out<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.769> also<00:02:26.159> cut<00:02:26.609> gas<00:02:26.879> totally<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.079> I

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
out I also cut gas totally so that I

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.839 
out I also cut gas totally so that I
could<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.469> more<00:02:28.920> money<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.519> building

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
could have more money to be building

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.699 
could have more money to be building
stuff<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.359> then<00:02:30.599> my<00:02:30.810> macro<00:02:31.139> slips<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
stuff and then my macro slips and I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.379 
stuff and then my macro slips and I
forget<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.400> build<00:02:32.609> out<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.879> my<00:02:33.000> barracks<00:02:33.269> oh

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
forget to build out of my barracks oh

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.509 
forget to build out of my barracks oh
that's<00:02:33.569> embarrassing<00:02:33.739> but<00:02:34.739> yeah<00:02:35.129> mike<00:02:35.340> is

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
they are using chrono boost on the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.899 
they are using chrono boost on the
zealots<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.379> here<00:02:46.680> are<00:02:46.829> three<00:02:47.069> zealots<00:02:47.430> this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.819 
you can see here i am finally getting a
second<00:02:54.540> bunker<00:02:54.840> down<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.349> bunker<00:02:55.680> is

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
second bunker down but that bunker is

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.740 
second bunker down but that bunker is
way<00:02:56.159> late<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.700> isn't<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.120> good<00:02:57.209> position<00:02:57.480> it's
