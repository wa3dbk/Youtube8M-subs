00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.080 

so<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> inside<00:01:27.600> real<00:01:27.930> quick<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.850> side

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so the inside real quick the side

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.490 
so the inside real quick the side
currents<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.780> faded<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.320> other
