chain<00:05:48.320> was<00:05:48.710> named<00:05:49.010> specifically<00:05:49.810> as<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.870> chain

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
chain was named specifically as a chain

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.550 
chain was named specifically as a chain
so<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.160> all<00:05:52.490> these<00:05:52.850> walls<00:05:53.270> will<00:05:53.570> be<00:05:53.720> as<00:05:54.050> links

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
so that all these walls will be as links

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.910 
so that all these walls will be as links
in<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.950> chain<00:05:54.980> of<00:05:55.480> links<00:05:56.480> by<00:05:56.630> design<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.440> by

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
in a chain of links by design and by

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.340 
in a chain of links by design and by
intention<00:05:58.550> so<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.420> we<00:05:59.630> will<00:05:59.960> all<00:06:00.080> know<00:06:00.320> that

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
intention so that we will all know that

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.990 
intention so that we will all know that
they're<00:06:00.650> all<00:06:00.770> connected<00:06:01.100> and<00:06:01.490> as<00:06:01.670> we<00:06:01.850> go

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
they're all connected and as we go

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.730 
they're all connected and as we go
forward<00:06:02.270> we<00:06:02.420> are<00:06:02.570> going<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:02.960> be<00:06:03.050> replicating

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
forward we are going to be replicating

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.800 
forward we are going to be replicating
this<00:06:03.890> across<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.670> country<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:05.240> across<00:06:05.690> the

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
this across the country and across the

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
this across the country and across the
globe<00:06:06.230> and<00:06:06.760> so<00:06:07.760> this<00:06:08.030> la<00:06:08.480> is<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.960> launch<00:06:09.170> city

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
globe and so this la is the launch city
