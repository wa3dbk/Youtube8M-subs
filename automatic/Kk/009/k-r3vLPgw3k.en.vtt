in my roll book and anyway this is a
very<00:02:01.310> field<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.150> we<00:02:02.299> did<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.840> these

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
very field that we did this on these

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.350 
very field that we did this on these
bleachers<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.340> are<00:02:04.430> behind<00:02:04.549> us<00:02:04.880> now<00:02:05.090> we're

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
bleachers that are behind us now we're

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960 
bleachers that are behind us now we're
not<00:02:05.510> here<00:02:05.900> at<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.380> time<00:02:06.680> those<00:02:07.520> bleachers

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
not here at that time those bleachers

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.510 
not here at that time those bleachers
over<00:02:08.090> there<00:02:08.360> were<00:02:08.630> but<00:02:09.530> they<00:02:09.830> were<00:02:09.890> wooden

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
over there were but they were wooden

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
over there were but they were wooden
bleachers<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.420> now<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.959> course<00:02:12.200> they've<00:02:12.410> been

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
bleachers and now of course they've been

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.809 
bleachers and now of course they've been
replaced<00:02:12.740> with<00:02:13.040> aluminum

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
replaced with aluminum

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.080 
replaced with aluminum
which<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.359> much<00:02:14.569> nicer<00:02:15.040> also<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.700> football

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
which is much nicer also the football

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.989 
which is much nicer also the football
games<00:02:17.329> now<00:02:17.629> are<00:02:17.870> played<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:18.469> on<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.739> field

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:18.999 
games now are played here on this field

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.429 
games now are played here on this field
when<00:02:19.999> I<00:02:20.030> was<00:02:20.329> coaching<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.870> played<00:02:21.109> all<00:02:21.260> our

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
when I was coaching we played all our

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.229 
when I was coaching we played all our
football<00:02:21.799> games<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.219> the<00:02:22.310> Gator<00:02:22.489> Bowl<00:02:22.700> right

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
football games at the Gator Bowl right

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.899 
football games at the Gator Bowl right
so<00:02:23.749> some<00:02:24.530> things<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:25.069> changed<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.549> little<00:02:25.670> bit

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
so some things have changed a little bit

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.940 
so some things have changed a little bit
and<00:02:28.389> you<00:02:29.389> know<00:02:29.420> whether<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.769> better

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and you know whether it's for the better

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.569 
and you know whether it's for the better
or<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.250> worse<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.700> not<00:02:31.939> for<00:02:32.150> me<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.269> say
