00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.689
 I will bring the solution for those who 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.840
 they commented in my launcher how 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.610
 download the minecraft version 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.350
 I had been told by many for free 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 they can open it or they can play and they can not 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.210
 it opens up good so I 'm going to bring you 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 the solution in this same video first 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
 they have to download the file this and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.830
 leave by mega and also by means fire 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 the options that are my two servers 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.850
 favorite servers of both we enter to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 this flick video and we have to 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.649
 wait for the five seconds that we 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.950
 delivery to flick can jump 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.820
 advertising will take you to the page 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 mega here leandro war to your computer 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 we expect him to carry alone weighs 142 megabytes 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 that would be nothing so to me for example 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 I've been downloaded in less than a minute 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.100
 and if they wanted it in mediafire also in 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.989
 the video will be the link 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.609
 we do the same thing we expect the 5 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.550
 seconds up here and once they pass 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.550
 we are going to give you jump advertising 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.420
 here we are in the middle fire and for 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.190
 download it they are putting a place 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.590
 and they will be down 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.960
 we go to the folder where it was downloaded 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.060
 especially here I'm going to cut it and I'm going 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.160
 to paste on the desk good once 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.990
 that we have it there the file is called 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.300
 solution or good extras and the name 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.850
 extract here would be 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.070

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.380
 open you are going to read this file of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.140
 Important read text is very important 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.120
 to make it read, I'm not going to do it 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.460
 you can do it precisely obviously 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.740
