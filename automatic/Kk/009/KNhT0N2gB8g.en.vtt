00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There will be even more bullfighting. This won't matter.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
June 9, 2012 • Las Ventas, Madrid

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Equanimal and CAS International gather 500 activists who demand the abolition of bullfighting

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
by encircling the bullfighting ring with a human chain

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Because no one should be born to be tortured or killed

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Respect for all, male or female, also for the animals

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have gathered today to form this human chain

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to demand that other chains,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
those which hold the victims of bullfighting,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
are broken forever.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Abolish bullfighting!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
An end to animal exploitation!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What we are trying to do is to reach out with the message

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that we must leave bullfighting behind, that bullfighting

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
must be abolished, just like other forms of aggression and torture

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
were abolished in the past.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Although right now we are combating bullfighting,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
we also maintain a position of solidarity and respect

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
towards the rest of the animals who are exploited in many other areas.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Animal rights now!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We will make it happen! Thanks for coming, for being there…

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
... for being their voice, for being the voice of the animals! Thanks!
