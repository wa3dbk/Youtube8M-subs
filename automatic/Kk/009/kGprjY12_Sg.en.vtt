starting to make kind of ripples in the
cream<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.750> getting<00:02:03.049> there<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:03.619> how

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
cream this is getting there that's how

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.999 
cream this is getting there that's how
you<00:02:03.830> know<00:02:04.040> yes<00:02:05.380> you'll<00:02:06.380> see<00:02:06.560> when<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:06.740> start

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
you know yes you'll see when I start

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:25.750 
you know yes you'll see when I start
beating<00:02:07.250> again

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.640 

see<00:02:26.760> how<00:02:26.910> their<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.600> was<00:02:27.900> rippling<00:02:28.350> very

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
see how their it was rippling very

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
see how their it was rippling very
heavily<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.610> must<00:02:29.730> tell<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.060> what<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:31.050> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
heavily and I must tell you what if you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.740 
heavily and I must tell you what if you
ever<00:02:31.260> heard<00:02:31.560> soft<00:02:32.010> peaks<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.640> medium<00:02:33.090> Peaks<00:02:33.420> or

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
ever heard soft peaks or medium Peaks or

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.020 
ever heard soft peaks or medium Peaks or
stiff<00:02:34.170> peaks<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.830> will<00:02:35.580> tell<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.820> what<00:02:35.940> that's

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
stiff peaks I will tell you what that's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.120 
stiff peaks I will tell you what that's
referring<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.570> when<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.200> lift<00:02:37.440> your<00:02:37.680> beaters

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
referring to when you lift your beaters

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.100 
referring to when you lift your beaters
out<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.940> whipped<00:02:39.150> cream<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.690> whatever

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
out of the whipped cream or whatever

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.380 
out of the whipped cream or whatever
your<00:02:40.290> beating<00:02:40.640> these<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.820> called<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> peaks

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
your beating these are called the peaks

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.660 
your beating these are called the peaks
right<00:02:42.630> there<00:02:42.840> when<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.310> cut<00:02:44.310> those<00:02:44.460> are<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
right there when you cut those are the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.270 
right there when you cut those are the
peaks<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.150> depending<00:02:45.960> how<00:02:46.080> long<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.950> whip

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
peaks and depending how long you whip

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.360 
peaks and depending how long you whip
the<00:02:47.610> cream<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:48.710> it<00:02:49.710> will<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:49.950> firmer<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the cream it it will get firmer and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
the cream it it will get firmer and
firmer<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.730> firmer<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:52.020> recipe<00:02:52.350> says

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
firmer and firmer so if a recipe says

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.530 
firmer and firmer so if a recipe says
soft<00:02:52.890> peaks<00:02:53.190> they<00:02:53.730> should<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.030> very<00:02:54.330> light

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
soft peaks they should be very light

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.970 
soft peaks they should be very light
light<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.810> should<00:02:54.960> probably<00:02:55.500> drip<00:02:55.770> back<00:02:55.950> down

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
light it should probably drip back down

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.830 
light it should probably drip back down
just<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.580> little<00:02:56.730> bit<00:02:56.850> needy<00:02:57.270> a-pink's<00:02:57.720> would

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
just a little bit needy a-pink's would

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.940 
just a little bit needy a-pink's would
be<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.080> know<00:02:58.200> summer<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> middle<00:02:58.800> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
be you know summer in the middle and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.790 
be you know summer in the middle and
stiff<00:02:59.640> peaks<00:02:59.970> these<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.630> pretty<00:03:01.020> stiff<00:03:01.560> we

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
stiff peaks these are pretty stiff we

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.900 
stiff peaks these are pretty stiff we
could<00:03:01.980> go<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> little<00:03:02.220> bit<00:03:02.370> different<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:02.790> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
could go a little bit different for you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.030 
could go a little bit different for you
wanted<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.500> know<00:03:04.530> they're<00:03:04.770> not<00:03:04.860> going

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
wanted to but you know they're not going

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.190 
wanted to but you know they're not going
anywhere<00:03:05.340> there's<00:03:06.330> they're<00:03:06.660> sick<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.020> there

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
anywhere there's they're sick in there

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.530 
anywhere there's they're sick in there
so<00:03:08.130> these<00:03:08.250> would<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.580> referred<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> anywhere

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so these would be referred to anywhere

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.720 
so these would be referred to anywhere
from<00:03:09.660> medium<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.050> stiff<00:03:10.380> peaks<00:03:10.410> I'm<00:03:11.400> not<00:03:11.610> gonna

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
from medium to stiff peaks I'm not gonna

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.910 
from medium to stiff peaks I'm not gonna
be<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.030> anymore<00:03:12.330> because<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.990> did<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.770> was

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
be to anymore because if I did it was

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.890 
be to anymore because if I did it was
starting<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> get<00:03:14.310> chunky<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.570> don't<00:03:15.750> want

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
starting to get chunky you don't want

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.570 
starting to get chunky you don't want
chunky<00:03:16.170> chunky<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.650> when<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.890> start<00:03:16.950> you're

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
chunky chunky is when you start you're

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.580 
chunky chunky is when you start you're
on<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.730> road<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.330> don't<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.350> in

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
on the road but I don't like that in

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.530 
on the road but I don't like that in
this<00:03:19.680> case<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.730> actually<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.209> write

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
this case so this is actually just write

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.900 
this case so this is actually just write
some<00:03:22.110> plum<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.470> beaters<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.980> scrape<00:03:23.730> down<00:03:23.850> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
some plum I beaters and scrape down the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.640 
some plum I beaters and scrape down the
edges<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.300> we're<00:03:24.600> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.840> combine<00:03:25.200> this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
edges and we're going to combine this

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.400 
edges and we're going to combine this
with<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.550> egg<00:03:27.450> white<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.810> sugar<00:03:28.050> make<00:03:28.260> sure

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
with the egg white and sugar make sure

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.960 
with the egg white and sugar make sure
that<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:28.769> had<00:03:29.010> going<00:03:29.190> earlier<00:03:29.580> want<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> fold

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that we had going earlier want to fold

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.239 
that we had going earlier want to fold
them<00:03:30.060> together
