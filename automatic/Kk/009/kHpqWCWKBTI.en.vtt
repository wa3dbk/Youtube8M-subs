right<00:01:36.509> hey<00:01:38.150> well<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:39.689> wires<00:01:39.900> here

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
right hey well I have two wires here

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.490 
right hey well I have two wires here
first<00:01:42.180> wire<00:01:42.479> mesh<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> said

twenty six inches and either one

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.100 
twenty six inches and either one
measures<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.600> 31<00:01:46.020> inches<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> goes<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
measures out at 31 inches so it goes to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.480 
measures out at 31 inches so it goes to
the<00:01:49.110> next<00:01:49.380> thing<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.100> well

the next thing you want to do is well
what<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> did<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.149> let<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.840> backtrack<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
what I did here was let me backtrack a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
what I did here was let me backtrack a
little<00:01:52.380> bit

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
little bit

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.780 
little bit
I<00:01:54.110> measured<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.829> pretty<00:01:56.369> much<00:01:56.460> did

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
I measured this and I pretty much did

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.389 
I measured this and I pretty much did
the<00:01:56.820> whole<00:01:57.240> spec<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.130> I'll<00:01:59.250> just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the whole spec for this one so I'll just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.600 
the whole spec for this one so I'll just
show<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.909> second<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.360> over<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:01.610> this

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
show you the second one over there this

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.510 
show you the second one over there this
will<00:02:02.820> measure<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.180> twenty<00:02:03.570> six<00:02:03.719> inches<00:02:04.520> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
will measure out twenty six inches it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.469 
will measure out twenty six inches it
ohms<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.360> ninety<00:02:06.719> five<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.520> divide<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.000> 95

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
ohms at ninety five so you divide the 95

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.100 
ohms at ninety five so you divide the 95
by<00:02:09.660> twenty<00:02:09.959> six

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
by twenty six

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.290 
by twenty six
and<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.710> get<00:02:11.830> three<00:02:12.010> point<00:02:12.250> six<00:02:12.400> five<00:02:12.700> three<00:02:12.760> 8

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and you get three point six five three 8

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.280 
and you get three point six five three 8
ohms<00:02:13.600> per<00:02:14.260> inch<00:02:15.660> now<00:02:16.660> once<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.900> get<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.140> inch

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
ohms per inch now once you get the inch

now what you want to do here is you want

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.580 
now what you want to do here is you want
to<00:04:03.060> measure<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.269> inches<00:04:04.780> first<00:04:05.080> because

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
to measure the inches first because

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.720 
to measure the inches first because
they're<00:04:05.769> all<00:04:05.860> different<00:04:06.250> size<00:04:06.400> wires

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
they're all different size wires

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.759 
they're all different size wires
obviously<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.959> want<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.230> get<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.590> one

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
obviously and you want to get it to one

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.460 
obviously and you want to get it to one
basic<00:04:09.310> same<00:04:09.790> scale<00:04:10.209> for<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.840> compare<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.440> two

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
basic same scale for to compare the two

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.770 
basic same scale for to compare the two
so<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.280> want<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.549> get<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:13.000> poor<00:04:13.239> foot<00:04:13.570> because

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
so you want to get the poor foot because

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.690 
so you want to get the poor foot because
that's<00:04:13.930> what<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.200> spec<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.709> also<00:04:15.100> from<00:04:15.640> a

really good the less the ohms the better
less<00:04:26.870> resistance<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:29.300> can<00:04:29.330> think<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.720> this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
less resistance you can think of this

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.890 
less resistance you can think of this
like<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.340> have<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.610> 3-inch<00:04:32.240> pipe<00:04:32.540> and

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
like this so you have a 3-inch pipe and

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.820 
like this so you have a 3-inch pipe and
you<00:04:33.260> have<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.440> 2-inch<00:04:33.800> pipe<00:04:34.600> right<00:04:35.620> now<00:04:36.620> what

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
you have a 2-inch pipe right now what

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.800 
you have a 2-inch pipe right now what
resistance<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.090> pour<00:04:38.330> water<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:38.720> that

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
resistance is if you pour water in that

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.690 
resistance is if you pour water in that
3-inch<00:04:39.169> pipe<00:04:39.440> it'll<00:04:40.070> go<00:04:40.160> straight<00:04:40.520> through

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
3-inch pipe it'll go straight through

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.210 
3-inch pipe it'll go straight through
say<00:04:41.300> two<00:04:41.360> gallons<00:04:43.330> every<00:04:44.330> 10<00:04:44.570> seconds<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:46.010> two

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
say two gallons every 10 seconds the two

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.460 
say two gallons every 10 seconds the two
inch<00:04:46.340> pipe<00:04:46.639> can<00:04:47.360> only<00:04:47.450> take<00:04:47.660> one<00:04:47.870> gallon<00:04:48.260> every

inch pipe can only take one gallon every

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.530 
inch pipe can only take one gallon every
10<00:04:48.680> seconds<00:04:49.190> there's<00:04:49.580> more<00:04:49.790> resistance<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:50.480> a

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
10 seconds there's more resistance in a

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.720 
10 seconds there's more resistance in a
smaller<00:04:50.840> pipe<00:04:51.139> so<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.919> more<00:04:52.100> resistance<00:04:52.610> you

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
smaller pipe so the more resistance you

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.690 
smaller pipe so the more resistance you
have<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:53.540> worse<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.080> wire<00:04:54.290> is<00:04:54.620> that's<00:04:55.400> the

if<00:05:03.410> you<00:05:03.590> had<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.710> bad<00:05:03.919> wire<00:05:04.280> it'd<00:05:04.669> be<00:05:04.850> off<00:05:04.970> it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
if you had a bad wire it'd be off it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.690 
if you had a bad wire it'd be off it
would<00:05:05.540> pretty<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:06.320> pre<00:05:06.530> obvious<00:05:07.040> be<00:05:07.460> pretty

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
would pretty be pre obvious be pretty

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.930 
would pretty be pre obvious be pretty
alpha<00:05:08.090> scale<00:05:08.390> so<00:05:09.350> within<00:05:09.800> 40<00:05:10.160> 50<00:05:10.580> you're<00:05:10.730> good

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
alpha scale so within 40 50 you're good

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.890 
alpha scale so within 40 50 you're good
or<00:05:11.180> less<00:05:11.660> you're<00:05:11.900> good<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.710> this<00:05:12.980> case<00:05:13.900> each

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
or less you're good in this case each

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.140 
or less you're good in this case each
wire<00:05:15.350> is<00:05:15.590> different<00:05:16.160> also<00:05:18.460> like<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.550> said<00:05:19.760> you

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
wire is different also like I said you

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.510 
wire is different also like I said you
have<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.360> put<00:05:20.540> everything<00:05:20.750> in<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.050> foot<00:05:21.520> per

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
have to put everything in the foot per

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.340 
have to put everything in the foot per
foot<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.030> could<00:05:23.180> actually<00:05:23.330> compare<00:05:24.260> the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
foot so you could actually compare the

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.490 
foot so you could actually compare the
wires<00:05:24.560> if<00:05:24.919> you<00:05:25.490> do<00:05:25.580> not<00:05:25.700> know<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.120> spec<00:05:26.540> what
