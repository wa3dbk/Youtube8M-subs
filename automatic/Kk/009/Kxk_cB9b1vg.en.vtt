00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.450 

it's<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.719> sad<00:00:00.930> moment<00:00:00.960> internet<00:00:01.620> friends<00:00:02.070> when

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
it's a sad moment internet friends when

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.150 
it's a sad moment internet friends when
I<00:00:02.490> realized<00:00:02.939> my<00:00:03.030> 345<00:00:04.020> pounds<00:00:04.049> bench<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.830> no

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
I realized my 345 pounds bench is no

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.280 
I realized my 345 pounds bench is no
longer<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.730> top<00:00:05.940> five<00:00:06.240> bracket<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.899> my<00:00:06.990> gym

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
longer in the top five bracket of my gym

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.350 
longer in the top five bracket of my gym
so<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:07.919> time<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.580> attack<00:00:08.910> benchpress

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
so it's time to attack benchpress

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:25.730 
so it's time to attack benchpress
aggressively<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> same<00:00:25.199> deal<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.410> last

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
aggressively so the same deal as last

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
aggressively so the same deal as last
time<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.070> begin<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.490> warm-up<00:00:26.910> sets

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
time we begin with some warm-up sets

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:41.969 
time we begin with some warm-up sets
explosive<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.170> fast

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.310 

just<00:00:42.979> to<00:00:43.100> recap<00:00:43.519> I<00:00:43.699> am<00:00:43.879> NOT<00:00:44.210> locking<00:00:44.839> my<00:00:44.930> joints

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
just to recap I am NOT locking my joints

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.240 
just to recap I am NOT locking my joints
out<00:00:45.379> completely<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:45.949> weight<00:00:46.070> is<00:00:46.219> not

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
out completely the weight is not

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.579 
out completely the weight is not
snapping<00:00:46.909> on<00:00:47.269> my<00:00:47.420> elbows<00:00:47.780> I'm<00:00:48.019> stopping<00:00:48.559> my

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
snapping on my elbows I'm stopping my

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.130 
snapping on my elbows I'm stopping my
arms<00:00:48.890> just<00:00:49.100> barely<00:00:49.489> short<00:00:49.909> of<00:00:50.000> lock<00:00:50.210> out<00:00:50.449> the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
arms just barely short of lock out the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.079 
arms just barely short of lock out the
snap<00:00:51.469> your<00:00:51.710> hearing<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:52.159> simply<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.610> speed<00:00:52.789> of

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
snap your hearing is simply the speed of

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:53.649 
snap your hearing is simply the speed of
the<00:00:53.180> bar

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
the bar

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.149 
the bar
I<00:00:53.690> like<00:00:53.960> warming<00:00:54.350> up<00:00:54.469> with<00:00:54.619> a<00:00:54.649> very<00:00:54.890> fast

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
I like warming up with a very fast

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.209 
I like warming up with a very fast
explosive<00:00:55.729> bar<00:00:56.239> speed<00:00:56.600> all<00:00:57.019> let's<00:00:57.320> do<00:00:57.530> 25<00:00:57.860> and

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
explosive bar speed all let's do 25 and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.380 
explosive bar speed all let's do 25 and
this<00:00:58.309> really<00:00:58.519> helps<00:00:58.789> when<00:00:58.909> you<00:00:58.969> warm<00:00:59.180> up<00:00:59.299> and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
this really helps when you warm up and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.000 
this really helps when you warm up and
activate<00:00:59.839> both<00:01:00.019> my<00:01:00.170> muscles<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.619> my<00:01:00.799> joints

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
activate both my muscles and my joints

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.620 
activate both my muscles and my joints
for<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.309> pause<00:01:01.460> reps<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:05.089> this<00:01:05.239> workouts

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
for the pause reps so this workouts

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.330 
for the pause reps so this workouts
going<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.899> be<00:01:05.960> an<00:01:06.080> exact<00:01:06.470> repeat<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.039> last

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
going to be an exact repeat of last

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.609 
going to be an exact repeat of last
Monday's<00:01:07.759> workout<00:01:08.240> but<00:01:08.810> most<00:01:09.259> of<00:01:09.470> you

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
Monday's workout but most of you

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.380 
Monday's workout but most of you
probably<00:01:10.190> missed<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:10.700> work<00:01:10.850> out<00:01:11.030> because<00:01:11.149> it

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
probably missed that work out because it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.910 
probably missed that work out because it
was<00:01:11.479> shoved<00:01:11.750> at<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:11.960> very<00:01:12.170> end<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.649> a<00:01:12.770> rather

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
was shoved at the very end of a rather

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.219 
was shoved at the very end of a rather
long<00:01:13.280> video<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.360> in<00:01:14.479> case<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.780> missed<00:01:15.020> it

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
long video so in case you missed it

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.020 
long video so in case you missed it

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
inform aesthetics so this is day number

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.449 
inform aesthetics so this is day number

day<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.789> going<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.030> be<00:01:38.090> different<00:01:38.569> from<00:01:38.690> here

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
day is going to be different from here

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.550 
day is going to be different from here
on<00:01:39.050> out<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.410> today<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:40.099> our<00:01:40.459> 10<00:01:40.940> sets<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.599> 3<00:01:42.259> reps

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
on out so today is our 10 sets of 3 reps

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.010 
on out so today is our 10 sets of 3 reps
and<00:01:43.009> we're<00:01:43.160> using<00:01:43.310> all<00:01:43.640> pause<00:01:44.119> reps<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.690> really

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
and we're using all pause reps to really

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.710 
and we're using all pause reps to really
work<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:45.319> that<00:01:45.440> pause<00:01:45.679> strength<00:01:46.160> now<00:01:47.030> I'm<00:01:47.360> only

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
work on that pause strength now I'm only

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.990 
work on that pause strength now I'm only
using<00:01:47.929> 245<00:01:48.679> very<00:01:49.160> late<00:01:49.429> in<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.610> grand<00:01:49.819> scheme

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
using 245 very late in the grand scheme

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.279 
using 245 very late in the grand scheme
of<00:01:50.119> things<00:01:50.179> I've<00:01:50.479> had<00:01:50.629> videos<00:01:51.050> where<00:01:51.200> I've

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
of things I've had videos where I've

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.100 
of things I've had videos where I've
done<00:01:51.440> 275<00:01:52.250> tap<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.759> go<00:01:52.879> 4<00:01:53.119> sets<00:01:53.269> of<00:01:53.360> 10<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
done 275 tap and go 4 sets of 10 the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.540 
done 275 tap and go 4 sets of 10 the
reason<00:01:54.379> I'm<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.590> light<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.099> because<00:01:55.459> we

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
reason I'm going light is because we

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.729 
reason I'm going light is because we
want<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.819> focus<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.209> technique<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.959> explosive

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
want to focus on technique and explosive

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.800 
want to focus on technique and explosive
bar<00:01:57.950> speed<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.429> all<00:01:58.580> 10<00:01:58.940> sets<00:01:59.330> we<00:01:59.509> don't<00:01:59.660> want

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
bar speed for all 10 sets we don't want

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.630
