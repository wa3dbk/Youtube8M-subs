 this video the party for snipers 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.799
 little experienced so for me can 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.100
 to experiment with these snipers who is stop 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.540
 who do not arrive at the quick scope and who 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.420
 can not seem to chained kilos style 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.880
 scared and the party for the most 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.979
 experienced so followers of the quick scope 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 and what I call recharging 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 which is not French in itself 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.790
 So here I go right away 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.960
 show the class that I already showed 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.880
 in my first snowy episode you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.090
 shows them for people to call it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.460
 ictv simon or claude is of course so 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 so here you take your sniper with 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.780
 equipments and adouls you 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.510
 want in secondary mantel nothing 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.100
 why nothing because it incites you 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.120
 to do as soon as it is so to break 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.830
 your 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.780
 another bloodthirsty series with your 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.459
 sniper in tactical electric charge 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.260
 to simply cover your 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:25.019
 back so first spot for them 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.420
 snipers little experienced it's here so 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.010
 we will call it the top 2 is the top 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.540
 up his purpose here on you have me 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.769
 understood so you can look here 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.900
 here and here so pretty good spot for those 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.150
 who see there that this club has 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.599
 I do not have to it is not a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.620
 critical 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.359
 so here you do what forgetting 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.390
 no this is it for the spot of it 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.090
 the top of his for the top 2 so it's okay 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.450
 be a little more fire not at all 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.569
 it's going to be pretty much the same thing except 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.250
 that at this point we can see more 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.810
 easily the enemies arrive and so 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.930
 it's a little easier to make 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.599
 kills here only in the top 2 so here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.640
 it's the top 2 so you can see 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:16.440
 here up there is out there so it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.599
 it's for the inexperienced senators 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.810
 so for the snipers a little bit more 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.930
 experienced there is this spot the very 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.090
 known at the level of feeder who and when 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.709
 you have the flag not when 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.989
 the enemy are talking to the flag at and that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.480
 you have the flag b and c the enemies 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.269
 go respaud is not behind this white wall 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.010
 there so who will arrive by the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.290
 left or right so that's enough 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.430
 easy for the copper geeks of 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.540
 coons quizzes coop to get you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.239
 to do that 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.790
 that's ready to do as soon as he 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.620
 is to chain more easily so 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.329
 that's it for a 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.030
 and also to the right corridor 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.260
 good that is pretty well known but it's 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.970
 more difficult to make kits because 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.220
 that there are often snipers lying at 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.019
 bottom of the map which is worth to scop and even 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.069
 big heavy machine guns that 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.200
 you also ball asparagus so the 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.180
 spot of c1 also extremely known 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.729
 because it's downright the opposite of 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.070
 oddly all zeniths janion 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.320
 hockey vion there so all the enemies 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.750
 go by there so you have more than 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.889
 chance to Kill So here here 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.300
 I advise you of the arrival there 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.610
 why because there are often 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.530
 snipers that's worth to pop artists at 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.380
 bottom of this map there at the bottom of this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.310
 even deep of this place so that's it 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.410
 I advise you to put yourself 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.210
 behind this kind of barrels so 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.310
 we are of glitch what is the r 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.039
 blitz and when the enemy barely sees 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.940
 your head and therefore has trouble admitting 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.760
 aim while you have a plain 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.030
 easy to aim to kill him 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.159
 so you can do that if you 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.889
 are in danger you move you do 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:02.680
 what you want you are free all 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.280
 men are born free and equal to us 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.800
 So that's all pure for this 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.639
 little second episode of how to do 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.110
 your your bloody sniper so the 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.699
 third I think it would be on the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.710
 newton 2025 map 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.690
 So here is my not yet tighter 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.250
 that exact is still he was still 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.099
 more difficult to make bloodthirsty 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.780
 to the sniper so I'm going to show you 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.150
 some spots that I know well 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.940
 so that they are known too I think 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.330
 and so that's it if you do not have it 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.580
 liked this video I invite you then 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.740
