the Cardinal modality so we have a lot

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.030 
the Cardinal modality so we have a lot
of<00:00:34.370> energy<00:00:34.760> flowing<00:00:35.450> into<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.260> intellectual

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
relationships this is a very social new

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.930 
relationships this is a very social new
moon<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.770> why<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:45.920> frequently<00:00:46.640> call

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
moon and this is why I frequently call

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.630 
moon and this is why I frequently call
the<00:00:47.090> new<00:00:47.240> moon<00:00:47.450> in<00:00:47.630> Libra<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.680> relationship

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
the new moon in Libra the relationship

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.450 
the new moon in Libra the relationship
moon<00:00:49.930> during<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.170> new<00:00:51.410> moon<00:00:51.650> we<00:00:51.980> will<00:00:52.250> have

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
moon during this new moon we will have

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.120 
moon during this new moon we will have
Venus<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.210> Mercury<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.020> a<00:00:54.110> sex<00:00:54.380> tool<00:00:54.590> aspect

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
Venus and Mercury and a sex tool aspect

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.250 
Venus and Mercury and a sex tool aspect
and<00:00:55.310> this<00:00:55.850> highlights<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.600> issue<00:00:56.900> of

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
and this highlights the issue of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.880 
and this highlights the issue of
idealism<00:00:57.950> and<00:00:58.250> how<00:00:58.910> frequently<00:00:59.630> when<00:01:00.380> we<00:01:00.560> step

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
idealism and how frequently when we step

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.490 
idealism and how frequently when we step
into<00:01:01.130> idealism<00:01:01.940> our<00:01:02.260> relationships<00:01:03.260> can

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
into idealism our relationships can

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.319 
into idealism our relationships can
suffer<00:01:03.920> because<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:04.399> set<00:01:04.670> up<00:01:04.790> cycles<00:01:05.210> of

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
suffer because we set up cycles of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.569 
suffer because we set up cycles of
disappointment<00:01:06.049> now<00:01:06.680> what<00:01:06.829> I<00:01:06.950> mean<00:01:07.220> by<00:01:07.280> this

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
disappointment now what I mean by this

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.300 
disappointment now what I mean by this
is<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.960> very<00:01:08.990> often<00:01:09.530> as<00:01:09.799> spiritual

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
is that so very often as spiritual

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.179 
is that so very often as spiritual
people<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:11.119> have<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.299> real<00:01:11.600> gift<00:01:11.960> in<00:01:12.380> seeing<00:01:12.979> the

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
people we have a real gift in seeing the

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.319 
people we have a real gift in seeing the
potential<00:01:13.820> within<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.840> person<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:15.469> then

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
potential within a person and then

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.940 
potential within a person and then
projecting<00:01:17.329> that<00:01:17.479> through<00:01:17.840> our<00:01:17.950> expectations

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
projecting that through our expectations

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.200 
projecting that through our expectations
we<00:01:19.729> idealize<00:01:20.690> what<00:01:21.680> could<00:01:22.040> be<00:01:22.370> their<00:01:22.670> behavior

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
we idealize what could be their behavior

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.170 
we idealize what could be their behavior
and<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:23.540> project<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.290> on<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:25.159> them<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.700> then

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
and we project that on to them and then

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.789 
and we project that on to them and then
we<00:01:26.299> get<00:01:26.450> disappointed<00:01:27.200> when<00:01:27.350> they<00:01:27.380> don't<00:01:27.620> live

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
we get disappointed when they don't live

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.370 
we get disappointed when they don't live
up<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.510> sometimes<00:01:29.510> we<00:01:29.960> miss<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
up to it and sometimes we miss the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.280 
up to it and sometimes we miss the
obvious<00:01:30.880> signals<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.150> are<00:01:32.210> there<00:01:32.659> that

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
obvious signals that are there that

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.920 
obvious signals that are there that
perhaps<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:34.010> person<00:01:34.460> isn't<00:01:34.909> ready<00:01:35.600> to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
perhaps that person isn't ready to

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.230 
perhaps that person isn't ready to
manifest<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:36.799> potential<00:01:37.369> at<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:37.880> time

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
manifest that potential at this time

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.719 
manifest that potential at this time
it's<00:01:38.960> our<00:01:39.110> own<00:01:39.320> expectation<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.310> gets<00:01:40.549> in

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
it's our own expectation that gets in

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.330 
it's our own expectation that gets in
the<00:01:40.820> way<00:01:40.970> because<00:01:41.869> face<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.710> potential<00:01:43.220> is

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
the way because face it the potential is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.730 
the way because face it the potential is
often<00:01:43.640> very<00:01:43.790> beautiful<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.720> Venus<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.710> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
often very beautiful and Venus is the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.260 
often very beautiful and Venus is the
ruler<00:01:46.400> of<00:01:46.430> Libra<00:01:47.180> Libra<00:01:48.020> once<00:01:48.320> beauty<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:50.090> what

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
ruler of Libra Libra once beauty so what

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.780 
ruler of Libra Libra once beauty so what
we<00:01:50.390> need<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.720> do<00:01:50.930> during<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.650> new<00:01:52.220> moon<00:01:52.490> in

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
we need to do during this new moon in

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.780 
we need to do during this new moon in
Libra<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.900> accept<00:01:54.560> where<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.640> other

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
guilt that we're letting them down

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760 
guilt that we're letting them down
spiritually<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:05.450> accept<00:02:06.080> them<00:02:06.290> for<00:02:06.320> where

spiritually but accept them for where
they<00:02:06.950> are<00:02:07.159> see<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.640> clearly<00:02:08.119> see<00:02:08.869> it

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
they are see it clearly see it

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.710 
they are see it clearly see it
practically<00:02:09.799> and<00:02:10.039> then<00:02:10.759> make<00:02:11.090> decisions

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
practically and then make decisions

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.530 
practically and then make decisions
about<00:02:11.989> our<00:02:12.769> relationships<00:02:13.640> based<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.329> that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
about our relationships based on that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.839 
about our relationships based on that
information<00:02:14.980> because<00:02:15.980> sometimes<00:02:16.519> when<00:02:16.700> we

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
information because sometimes when we

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.000 
information because sometimes when we
see<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.150> clearly<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.840> may<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:18.290> choose<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.799> hang

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
see it clearly we may not choose to hang

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.330 
see it clearly we may not choose to hang
out<00:02:19.220> with<00:02:19.250> them<00:02:19.640> anymore<00:02:20.439> but<00:02:21.439> it<00:02:21.590> helps<00:02:22.129> us

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
out with them anymore but it helps us

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
out with them anymore but it helps us
avoid<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.090> cycles<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.599> disappointment<00:02:24.380> that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
avoid the cycles of disappointment that
