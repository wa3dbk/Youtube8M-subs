should stop doing intros and maybe I

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.839 
should stop doing intros and maybe I
should<00:02:09.459> just<00:02:09.489> begin<00:02:10.479> with<00:02:11.049> random<00:02:11.640> topics<00:02:12.640> of

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849

just gone off on a ridiculous random
train<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.489> thought<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.940> I'm<00:03:46.270> going<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.480> stop

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
train of thought and I'm going to stop

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
train of thought and I'm going to stop
here<00:03:47.050> think<00:03:47.860> about<00:03:48.130> what<00:03:48.310> I'm<00:03:48.400> doing<00:03:48.430> with<00:03:48.700> my

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
here think about what I'm doing with my

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
life and then attempt to carry on this

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.850 
life and then attempt to carry on this
commentary<00:03:51.600> okay<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.290> apparent<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.770> me

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
commentary okay so it is apparent to me

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.440 
commentary okay so it is apparent to me
that<00:03:53.890> I've<00:03:54.160> spent<00:03:54.489> most<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.120> video

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450

sure in future episodes we will be

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.379 
sure in future episodes we will be
winning<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.280> didn't<00:05:03.280> think<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.580> got<00:05:04.180> in<00:05:04.300> the

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
winning I didn't think that got in the

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.840 
winning I didn't think that got in the
way<00:05:04.510> too<00:05:04.570> much<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.889> gameplay<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.610> went

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
way too much of the gameplay that went

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.260 
way too much of the gameplay that went
on<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:06.970> thought<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.450> was<00:05:07.570> at<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.110> high<00:05:08.350> level<00:05:08.650> of

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
on I thought it was at a high level of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.900 
on I thought it was at a high level of
gaming<00:05:10.270> throwing<00:05:10.930> knife<00:05:11.080> ability<00:05:11.669> not<00:05:12.669> making

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
gaming throwing knife ability not making

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.909 
gaming throwing knife ability not making
much<00:05:13.030> sense<00:05:13.060> anymore<00:05:13.510> but<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.530> is<00:05:14.680> my

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
much sense anymore but that is my

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.250 
much sense anymore but that is my
reasoning<00:05:15.520> for<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.060> loss<00:05:16.270> because<00:05:17.110> the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
reasoning for the loss because the

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.219 
reasoning for the loss because the
gameplay<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.950> think<00:05:18.520> was<00:05:19.229> entertaining

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
gameplay I think was entertaining

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.230 
gameplay I think was entertaining
