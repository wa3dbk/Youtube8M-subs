00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
I mean I'm a bit close to the left but

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.990 
I mean I'm a bit close to the left but
at<00:02:30.579> least<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.879> into<00:02:31.090> space<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.280> Park<00:02:33.700> sense

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
at least it into space so Park sense

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.420 
at least it into space so Park sense
it's<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.269> handy<00:02:34.599> feature<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.959> have<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:36.400> see

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430

my<00:02:42.519> recommendation<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:43.359> that<00:02:43.389> you<00:02:43.659> practice

my recommendation is that you practice
with<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.379> because<00:02:44.799> there<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.040> have<00:02:45.280> to

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
with it because there you have to

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.830 
with it because there you have to
