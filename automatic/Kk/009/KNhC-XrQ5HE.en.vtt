00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.769
 and you will see the improvements of the 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.040
 elite giant Indian frank squad 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.200
 is increasingly selected and allows 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.810
 meet the whole brazil 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.910
 the taste for raising birds is something that 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.820
 was passed from generation to generation 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.249
 family of your antônio carlos de andrade 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.949
 both his paternal grandparents as the 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:30.259
 mother raised chicken but 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.960
 they wanted a chicken that was large 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.730
 higher than existing at the time that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.420
 have a meat with the flavor 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.609
 differentiated it there in the 40's and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.969
 in 1970 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.340
 your antonio carlos at 10 years old 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.039
 began to raise broiler roosters 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.579
 It has always been curious that on a trip that 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.940
 She made by the family to the mines made 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.589
 purchase of Malaysian roosters and llamo and 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.589
 hid from father 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.170
 the acquisition of these two breeds was by 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.449
 grandfather's instruction so that they could 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.630
 the crossing of the races with the chicken 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.840
 which gave rise to the Indian chicken 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.840
 giant 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.140
 today the producer creates 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.780
 breeders and on the property 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.170
 located in the capital of Goiás 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.310
 has more than 400 Indian birds 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.200
 giant 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 we work with non-elite animals 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.119
 have lots of small cars 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.789
 here are six pickets we go 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 split now we turn into 12 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.860
 in these twelve pickets there are ten chickens and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.850
 a cock in each with a nest of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.219
 trapdoor 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.679
 we have a genetic control of the father 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.209
 mother or the chicken will lay the egg there 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.909
 trapdoor in the ring we will take 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.840
 this egg and know son of any line 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.670
 What the cock? 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.250
 you can observe that our actions have 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.640
 a shackle on the wing shackles in blue 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.770
 in the wing that is her genetic control 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.530
 the farm owned by your antonio 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.539
 is undergoing an expansion 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.239
 meeting the regulations of the Ministry of 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.819
 agriculture, the producer explains 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.260
 the modifications to be made 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.640
 one is to make the farm entrance her 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.950
 will have to have a women's locker room 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.380
 male will have to have their earnings 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.799
 covered with canvas and we're doing 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.750
 here's this requirement from them later 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.389
 that the eggs leave the nests on the pickets 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 go directly to this place if the 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:35.160
 antônio gives more details here first 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 will undergo disinfection and a 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.829
 selection of which will stop by your 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.829
 chair 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.090
 after these three days he goes first 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.120
 with incubators 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.730
 there are 18 days in incubators after 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 to transfer to the offspring to them 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.380
 stay five more days at birth or 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.639
 either with 21 days begin to hatch 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.069
 Ends at 23 days 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.680
 these chicks are prepared to 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.590
 be marketed that already have a 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.170
 guaranteed all over Brazil and has a 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.799
 average production of 500 Indian puppies 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.400
 month to three-week sales 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:14.430
 average of 400 grams 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.359
 that 1 common caipirinha weighs on average 80 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.940
 grams 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.810
 the giant Indian chicken comes to the point of 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.870
 with an average of 80 to 105 days and 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.210
 for reproduction from eight months 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.300
 male and seven months on end 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.970
 the area is considered adult from 14 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.950
 both the chickens with renting it are the 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.040
 main major care 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.680
 I tried at this stage, I believe Tim 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.780
 Looks like you have a good player to 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.610
 Do you have a good grandmother? 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.170
 the most interesting are the first 30 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.060
 days are 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.250
 it needs to have a good source of heat 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.610
 a good diet to receive the first 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.140
 doses of vaccine that the vaccine against fool 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.240
 freight account in case is very 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.100
 It's important for you to do this when 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.050
 You 're only in the pasture. 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.360
 receive a growth rate 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.210
 you can provide maize can provide 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.730
 rest of greenery rest of greenery 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.560
 many still confuse the giant Indian 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.080
 with the fight chicken 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.570
 what is more aggressive is really so 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.310
 the genetic work we have done to 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.470
 During those years it was just that. 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.150
 we got a chicken that has the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.310
 characteristics of the cock of 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.200
 we take away the aggressiveness or 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.060
 indignant and middle of the tip of the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.220
 tip of the largest beak we had 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.380
 Until today it was one meter and twenty-two 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.940
 So we say we can get to 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.770
 up to one meter and twenty-two 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.910
 is the pattern according to the association 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.940
 Brazilian 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.250
 the new default standard now of 2014 is the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.140
 chicken he has to have a meter of 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.920
 length of the tip of the nail to the 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.600
 beak and chickens the chickens of 85 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.750
 centimeters from the tip of the nail to the 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.430
 beak today imdante is i speak without 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.170
 fear of making mistakes that is one of the best 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.620
 business today within livestock 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.230
 Brazilian calls this because 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.510
 you have a little space a little 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.580
 investment you have a bird with high 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.170
 what we call 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.960
 av byproducts 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.990
 is all harnessed the feces of the animal 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.450
 turns the chicken bed into 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.790
 gardens fertilizer we use the 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.040
 we have today is dung and systemic today 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.020
 we are marketing it the dac de 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.720
 What time is it there? 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.300
 here the people come here and snake of the wise 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.390
 of manure fertilizer in the place we can 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.790
 also observe the difference between the rooster 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.340
 and the giant Indian is the first 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.210
 difference you will notice is what is the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.820
 postage 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.160
 this one in my hand 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.140
 a giant Indian and here in fashion 2011 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.470
 river cattle cock of cockfight 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.700
 combatant the other the other difference is the 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.270
 aggressiveness 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.490
 This one fights for nothing and he has a 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.470
 and if here the index guarantees it is not 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.220
 a quiet place is a quiet place 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.430
 another characteristic is the taste of meat 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.830
 this one has a tender and tasty meat 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.950
 and if you have a hard face like caipirinha 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.660
 common co2 stay together this little one 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.490
 will hit a big one is little and go to 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.740
 run 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.560
 the roasted chicken physically improved 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.450
 There's a lot of difference between the giant Indian 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.520
 the difference between the indi- 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.250
 improved are they huge 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.020
 first you can observe the 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.860
 characteristics size the index wins is 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.270
 far greater than the improved country man is the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.230
 Improved hill country crest is a 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.500
 Big child 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.530
 the beautiful duoji giant does not have little 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.480
 child as barbarella the internment 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.600
 look at the size of his feathers have much 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.420
 sorry, it 's a shame it 's a shame 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.210
 Indian has very little penalty or punishment 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.870
 another thing that is the main thing is the taste 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.570
 of meat 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.850
 the one who slaughters the 70 days the severe 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.250
 stay with the meat with the soft meat 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.380
 already the giant Indian hick he has the 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.930
 meat more harder rhythm and a taste 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.610
 taste of hunting and if it has more flavor 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.190
 This is one of the great 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.030
 difference between an improved country man and 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.030
 giant wind
