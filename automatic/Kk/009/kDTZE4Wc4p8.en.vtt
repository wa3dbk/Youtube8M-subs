find the one you want to download and

find the one you want to download and
you<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.759> over<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.090> now<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:55.289> patch<00:01:55.500> column

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you go over here now the patch column

you go over here now the patch column
I<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.789> largely<00:01:57.539> ignore<00:01:57.930> these<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.439> columns

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
I would largely ignore these two columns

stood<00:03:31.630> for<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.870> eighteen<00:03:32.140> eleven<00:03:32.260> files

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
stood for the eighteen eleven files

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.620 
stood for the eighteen eleven files
so<00:03:33.580> what<00:03:33.700> I'm<00:03:33.760> going<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.910> do<00:03:34.060> here<00:03:34.330> we're<00:03:34.510> just

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
so what I'm going to do here we're just

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.140 
so what I'm going to do here we're just
going<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.840> extract<00:03:35.560> these<00:03:35.980> files<00:03:36.549> I'm<00:03:37.000> not

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
going to extract these files I'm not

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.430 
going to extract these files I'm not
going<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.330> do<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.420> now<00:03:37.600> because<00:03:37.750> it's<00:03:37.989> five<00:03:38.170> gig

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
going to do it now because it's five gig

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.920 
going to do it now because it's five gig
and<00:03:38.560> my<00:03:38.650> system<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.310> not<00:03:39.549> SSD<00:03:39.970> yet<00:03:40.180> shame<00:03:40.630> on<00:03:40.780> me

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
and my system is not SSD yet shame on me

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.930 
and my system is not SSD yet shame on me
so<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.739> basically<00:03:41.860> drag<00:03:42.340> them<00:03:42.580> from<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.910> zip

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
so you basically drag them from the zip

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.400 
so you basically drag them from the zip
file<00:03:43.269> into<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.930> 811<00:03:44.579> folder<00:03:45.579> or<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.200> name<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.320> it

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
file into a 811 folder or the name of it

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.930 
file into a 811 folder or the name of it
that<00:03:47.620> matches<00:03:47.980> whatever<00:03:48.190> name<00:03:48.459> you've<00:03:48.700> chosen

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
that matches whatever name you've chosen

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.300 
that matches whatever name you've chosen
for<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.420> once<00:03:50.260> you've<00:03:50.380> done<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.530> you'll<00:03:51.040> see

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
for it once you've done that you'll see

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.060 
for it once you've done that you'll see
those<00:03:52.060> patch<00:03:52.360> files<00:03:52.690> are<00:03:52.959> now<00:03:53.140> extracted<00:03:53.799> into

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
those patch files are now extracted into

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.360 
those patch files are now extracted into
the<00:03:55.410> folder<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.530> just<00:03:56.620> created<00:03:56.860> so

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
the folder that you just created so

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.560 
the folder that you just created so
let's<00:03:57.519> say<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:57.640> all<00:03:58.209> intense<00:03:58.480> purposes

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
let's say for all intense purposes

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.100 
let's say for all intense purposes
that's<00:03:59.079> these<00:03:59.230> files<00:03:59.530> let's<00:04:00.459> move<00:04:00.760> them<00:04:00.910> over

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
that's these files let's move them over

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.240 
that's these files let's move them over
so<00:04:02.110> this<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.320> what<00:04:02.440> you'll<00:04:02.560> see<00:04:02.620> effectively

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
so this is what you'll see effectively

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.650 
so this is what you'll see effectively
now<00:04:03.400> ignore<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.850> fact<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.120> these<00:04:04.299> are<00:04:04.360> not

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
now ignore the fact that these are not

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.720 
now ignore the fact that these are not
for<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.870> ten<00:04:05.260> sorry<00:04:06.070> not<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.250> eight<00:04:06.370> eleven

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
for a ten sorry not for eight eleven

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.890 
for a ten sorry not for eight eleven
they're<00:04:06.850> actually<00:04:07.090> eight<00:04:07.180> ten<00:04:07.390> nuts<00:04:07.600> that's

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
they're actually eight ten nuts that's

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.729 
they're actually eight ten nuts that's
neither<00:04:08.049> here<00:04:08.170> nor<00:04:08.290> there

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
neither here nor there

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.590 
neither here nor there
the<00:04:09.340> next<00:04:09.549> thing<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.700> need<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.030> now

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
the next thing you need to do now

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600 
the next thing you need to do now
they're<00:04:10.870> extracted<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.100> need<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.250> install

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
they're extracted is you need to install

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.280 
they're extracted is you need to install
something<00:04:12.820> on<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.060> system<00:04:13.299> called<00:04:13.480> 7-zip<00:04:13.840> now

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
something on a system called 7-zip now

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.380 
something on a system called 7-zip now
7-zip<00:04:14.799> is<00:04:15.070> if<00:04:15.820> you<00:04:15.910> don't<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.150> what<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.359> is

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
7-zip is if you don't know what it is

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.460 
7-zip is if you don't know what it is
it's<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.780> WinZip

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
it's like WinZip

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.880 
it's like WinZip
but<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:19.200> tend<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.260> be<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.620> tends<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.829> be

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
but it's tend to be it's tends to be

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.550 
but it's tend to be it's tends to be
quite<00:04:20.979> favored<00:04:21.519> by<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:22.180> lot<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.450> people<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.530> you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
quite favored by a lot of people so you

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.460 
quite favored by a lot of people so you

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
need to go to seven - zip Dahl and you

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.680 
need to go to seven - zip Dahl and you
download<00:04:26.650> either<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.820> deck<00:04:28.210> see<00:04:28.390> which<00:04:28.510> ones

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
download either the deck see which ones

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.460 
download either the deck see which ones
are<00:04:28.780> set<00:04:28.990> up

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
are set up

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.930 
are set up
and<00:04:29.560> modifies<00:04:30.340> your<00:04:30.370> registry<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:30.850> does

other<00:04:31.060> bits<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.330> pieces<00:04:31.470> or<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.650> download

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
other bits and pieces or you download

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.100 
other bits and pieces or you download
the<00:04:33.850> MSI<00:04:34.030> which<00:04:34.330> does<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.570> same<00:04:34.600> thing<00:04:34.990> but

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
the MSI which does the same thing but

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.360 
the MSI which does the same thing but
the<00:04:35.200> big<00:04:35.350> difference<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.010> really<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.340> a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
the big difference here is really this a

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.750 
the big difference here is really this a
64-bit<00:04:37.090> install<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.160> download<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.580> one

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
64-bit install so you download the one

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.760 
64-bit install so you download the one
that<00:04:40.420> you<00:04:40.600> want<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:41.290> is<00:04:41.470> trustworthy
