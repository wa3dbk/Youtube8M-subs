not just recording video to a VCR that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.399 
not just recording video to a VCR that
then<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.300> have<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.479> find<00:01:50.720> out<00:01:50.930> in<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> morning

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.050 
then you have to find out in the morning
if<00:01:51.500> something<00:01:51.770> happened<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.370> look<00:01:52.909> through

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
if something happened and look through

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.180

that<00:01:53.090> video<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:54.200> actually<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.680> intelligent

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
that video this actually is intelligent

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.590 
that video this actually is intelligent
enough<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.430> where<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.820> can<00:01:55.970> send<00:01:56.210> email

up<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.430> 32<00:03:43.820> camera<00:03:44.210> is<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.360> very<00:03:44.600> slick

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
up to 32 camera is a very slick

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.930 
up to 32 camera is a very slick
interface<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.220> allows<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.610> double

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
interface that allows you to double

click on a camera feed zoom zoom into it
like<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.020> said<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.290> an<00:03:51.380> intelligent<00:03:51.860> device

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
like I said it's an intelligent device

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.800 
like I said it's an intelligent device
so<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:53.180> want<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.390> set<00:03:53.570> up<00:03:53.660> motion

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
so if you want to set up motion

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.440 
so if you want to set up motion
detection<00:03:54.260> when<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:55.040> motion<00:03:55.490> is<00:03:55.640> detected

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
detection when that motion is detected

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.300 
detection when that motion is detected
it<00:03:56.840> can<00:03:56.990> trigger<00:03:57.230> an<00:03:57.380> event<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.800> where<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.130> is

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
it can trigger an event to where that is

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.680 
it can trigger an event to where that is
when<00:03:58.460> it<00:03:58.610> starts<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.910> record<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.480> hard

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
when it starts to record to the hard

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.720 
when it starts to record to the hard
driver<00:03:59.960> to<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.230> server<00:04:00.470> or<00:04:00.800> like<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.430> said<00:04:01.610> it

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
driver to the server or like I said it

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.880 
driver to the server or like I said it
sends<00:04:02.000> an<00:04:02.090> email<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:03.260> along<00:04:03.650> with<00:04:03.680> some

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
sends an email and this along with some

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.140 
sends an email and this along with some
of<00:04:04.010> our<00:04:04.100> other<00:04:04.130> high-end<00:04:04.430> cameras<00:04:05.000> it

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
of our other high-end cameras it

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.600 
of our other high-end cameras it
supports<00:04:05.660> 3gpp<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.280> if<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.490> have<00:04:07.580> a

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
supports 3gpp so if you have a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.420 
supports 3gpp so if you have a
smartphone<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:08.210> supports<00:04:08.750> 3gpp<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:10.250> can

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
smartphone that supports 3gpp you can

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.850 
smartphone that supports 3gpp you can
actually<00:04:10.880> view<00:04:11.120> on<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.630> smartphone<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
actually view on that smartphone the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.160 
actually view on that smartphone the
live<00:04:13.040> video<00:04:13.250> that's<00:04:13.640> being<00:04:13.820> captured<00:04:14.150> by<00:04:14.660> this

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
live video that's being captured by this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.039 
live video that's being captured by this
camera<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.250> it's<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.460> very<00:04:16.489> live<00:04:17.450> interactive

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
camera so it's a very live interactive

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.550 
camera so it's a very live interactive
device<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.920> it<00:04:19.549> also<00:04:19.700> can<00:04:20.390> be<00:04:20.420> used<00:04:21.140> with<00:04:21.290> our

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560
