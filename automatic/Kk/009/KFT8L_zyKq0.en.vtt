00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello to all mattoscacco.com friends welcome to a new tutorial today 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.180
 let's see the defense damiano someone of you sure already knows and who knows it 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.619
 of the advice to really look 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.749
 carefully these things because not infrequently 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.539
 it happens that some of your opponent can play these certain moves 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.990
 you are white 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.609
 and your opponent plays with black 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.480
 obviously this only works if you want it open with 4 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.700
 e2 4 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.440
 your opponents respond with e7 e5 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.120
 obviously it continues with the classic horse 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.210
 f3ar 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.589
 your opponent does not defend not 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.390
 with horse you are there 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.950
 I don't understand 26 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.050
 but it would still be a usual Rome move 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.490
 but it depends on bezzi with f6 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.719
 the purpose of this time is to 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.719
 extend the pawn and 5 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.299
 in such a way as to preserve the painter d free 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.750
 for a possible future Hindi push 5 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.090
 ddl not bad 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.550
 however these can be refuted with 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.830
 bishop c4 which in any case prevents the advance of this pawn 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.090
 black, however, can be countered 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.470
 I sell you are there 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.600
 and finally t5 in this case to the advantage of black 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.610
 however there is a move 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.180
 you can simplify the tour 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 and from you a strong Albian advantage 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.240
 it is about 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.880
 horse for hi5 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420
 let's see what happens if 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.490
 black catch 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.630
 pedone in f man getting tg5 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.590
 let's do a little reckoning 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.030
 the account of the showdown 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 why 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.729
 % see that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.760
 white has lost a horse 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.350
 he was lost a pawn 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.899
 materially montagen and roma positioning 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 and fitting the white with tuna h5 check 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.669
 seeeera plays 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.059
 g6 an instinctive but wrong move 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.749
 white plays 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.319
 woman for e5 check 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.760
 black, for example, must defend itself from the drain 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.509
 in white he earns a cake 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.889
 after woman for r4 checkmate 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.609
 this move of bishop i need 2 incorrect feces the woman can get into g2 far 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:42.549
 damage 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.339
 therefore it is advisable to move leopard 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.339
 not pre but really cancels from 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.249
 be afraid of white so in this case there is the advantage and white 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.999
 let's see now it was where we catch 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.759
 e5 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.719
 black movie does not take 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 crib still plays women and 7 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.359
 mares times threatened e 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.479
 if we remove the horse 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.019
 wherever 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.919
 for example in f3 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.609
 the woman can make you earn the pawn link e4 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.760
 now what can you play if you want to change women 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.629
 there is no method 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.689
 + oooh easy that playing women and two with exchange wanting or nolendo of 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:34.300
 women 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.189
 if you want to take the lead, play fire 2 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.149
 because you take the lead with this move because white is already a horse 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.679
 from the holidays developed and from the next move harroch was 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.899
 mind me 3 mom no developer piece from is the real non stop 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.239
 the piece developed by irre 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.429
 and the bomb on the same column what does it mean 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:59.239
 it means he can 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.559
 to receive at any time 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.589
 a nailing 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.299
 for example if 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.289
 for allergies 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:15.609
 siam nailing the woman is nailed not place star site of the gf ferrÃ¨ 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:21.649
 then the daughter white shit heavy pieces eh like towers that has the 

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.029
 center while 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:30.059
 while tirrenia rho is still the center probably certainly rocker a 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.800
 long 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 but if he suffered the woman who entered the game that 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:36.069
 we know well 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.719
 that the woman at the center instead of making a proud woman immediately 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.919
 it's not one of the best moves 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.960
 therefore the Damian defense 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.960
 consists in defending the pawn 5 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.500
 you should be educated but after which the sacrifice xd high cable is triggered
