getting a string value but this is the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:49.600 
getting a string value but this is the
amp<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.079> better<00:00:34.739> levels

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the right off and obviously you could

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
the right off and obviously you could
wreak<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.010> it<00:01:32.160> but<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> sounds<00:01:32.820> pretty<00:01:33.030> good

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.749 

rolls<00:02:08.239> with<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> gang<00:02:09.289> way<00:02:09.709> down<00:02:10.009> if<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.399> crank

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
rolls with a gang way down if we crank

on forgot to mention if I go over to the
distortion<00:02:33.890> side<00:02:34.160> I've<00:02:34.370> got<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.700> without<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
distortion side I've got it without the

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.960 
distortion side I've got it without the
punch<00:02:35.540> engaged<00:02:35.989> with<00:02:36.470> bright<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.700> without

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970

punch engaged with bright and without
the<00:02:38.180> mid<00:02:38.360> shift

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.180 

see<00:02:54.780> that's<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.140> pretty<00:02:55.410> maybe<00:02:55.770> that's<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.040> bit

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
see that's a pretty maybe that's a bit

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.010 
see that's a pretty maybe that's a bit
much<00:02:56.250> reaper<00:02:58.010> pretty<00:02:59.010> nice<00:02:59.180> crunchy<00:03:00.180> good

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
much reaper pretty nice crunchy good

much reaper pretty nice crunchy good
classic<00:03:01.770> rock<00:03:01.800> song<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.270> engage<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
classic rock song and if you engage the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.380 
classic rock song and if you engage the
punch<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.000> i<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.390> gain<00:03:15.570> about<00:03:17.150> 2<00:03:18.150> 30

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
punch you see i got to gain about 2 30

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.250 
punch you see i got to gain about 2 30
or<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.870> when<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.440> engage<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.010> punch<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.520> adds

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
or so when you engage the punch it adds

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.340 
or so when you engage the punch it adds
quite<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.350> bit<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:23.600> little<00:03:24.600> more<00:03:24.780> noise<00:03:25.050> have

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
quite a bit of a little more noise have

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:49.830 
quite a bit of a little more noise have
quite<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> bit<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.330> saturation

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.699 

and<00:03:50.840> uh<00:03:51.220> quickly<00:03:52.220> switch<00:03:52.940> back<00:03:53.209> switch<00:03:53.870> a

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
and uh quickly switch back switch a

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.559 
and uh quickly switch back switch a
boost<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:57.519> put<00:03:58.519> on<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.760> boost<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.239> doesn't

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
boost on put on the boost it doesn't

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.559 
boost on put on the boost it doesn't
really<00:03:59.690> increase<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.260> volume<00:04:01.450> increases<00:04:02.450> the

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
really increase the volume increases the

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.240 
really increase the volume increases the
saturation

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.610 

you

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.949 

you

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.200 

and

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:53.840 

man

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.040 

last<00:04:54.850> thing<00:04:55.060> I'll<00:04:55.210> show<00:04:55.450> you<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.780> have

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
last thing I'll show you this have

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.920 
last thing I'll show you this have
built-in<00:04:56.500> delay<00:04:56.770> as<00:04:56.950> well<00:04:57.330> I've<00:04:58.330> got<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.660> set

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
built-in delay as well I've got it set

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:15.580 
built-in delay as well I've got it set
to<00:04:59.700> analog

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:42.600 

tap<00:05:16.590> tempo<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.120> can<00:05:18.270> set<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.149 

when<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:43.669> go<00:05:43.819> back<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.389> clean<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:45.710> keep<00:05:45.919> it

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
when I go back to the clean and keep it

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.879 
when I go back to the clean and keep it
down<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:46.669> gain<00:05:47.300> side<00:05:47.659> you<00:05:48.349> can<00:05:48.500> also<00:05:48.650> get

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
down the gain side you can also get

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.589 
down the gain side you can also get
country<00:05:49.310> in<00:05:49.400> here<00:05:49.580> but<00:05:49.729> i<00:05:49.759> can't<00:05:50.030> play<00:05:50.120> country

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
country in here but i can't play country

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.899 
country in here but i can't play country
put<00:05:51.530> down<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.830> crunch<00:05:52.099> I<00:05:52.310> mean<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.669> take<00:05:53.539> the

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
put down the crunch I mean and take the

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.540 
put down the crunch I mean and take the
gain<00:05:55.909> down<00:05:55.940> again<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.949> think<00:05:57.949> it<00:05:58.069> gets<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.310> pretty

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
gain down again I think it gets a pretty

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:15.620 
gain down again I think it gets a pretty
nice

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:27.129 

hmm

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.890
