00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.620
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.120
 this video is only a short thing 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.000
 I would like to show you how I like that 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.700
 make rounds at 1 use 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 For that I always start with a round 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.520
 An air mesh then cuts exactly 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.650
 in the next stitch the exact same 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.680
 submit them here and crochet one there 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 solid mass into than builds up 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.989
 construction mesh and crochet half 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.649
 chopsticks with a half-stick 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 hats normally continue with it daily 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.879
 now a whole round at the end of the round 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.879
 it continues immediately 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.210
 I have the round now to the end 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.440
 persevered here comes again 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.300
 a solid half a stick into it 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.239
 and then you can see the air mass here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.460
 crocheted you have the tight the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.539
 solid mass and here already the first 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.180
 half places 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.630
 Now I'm up here in the mesh 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.479
 between my tight mesh and mine 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.540
 is the first half rod the print is an 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.700
 These ones 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.909
 I'll show it again, it's right here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.240
 between the two of these these are exactly the ones 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.450
 I put a hol the thread through 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.490
 and close the round 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.799
 Now it's half sun 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.780
 pulled up and up here has the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.119
 bar over that laid the whole one too 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.460
 looks like half a stick so 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.390
 the solid mesh has been so forward 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.399
 That's why you get so much 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.259
 looks nice even mesh picture 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.369
 the whole from the inside sees the whole 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.759
 so out and so daily my whole 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.759
 benefit
