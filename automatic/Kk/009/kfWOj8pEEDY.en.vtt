00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.240
 permaculture design.fr we are at 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 the island of the meeting where we come from 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.430
 do a permaculture design internship 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.930
 in tropical environment and so we visit 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.570
 lardin which is a site that promotes 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.420
 aquaculture for farmers 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.400
 of the region and therefore outside the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.500
 culture as we know it a little 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.760
 little more classical we will say well we 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.240
 find something very interesting 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 in darda it's a test of dakwa pony in 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.810
 semi commercial we will say that is to say 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 that there you see several basins that 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.460
 total about 100 square meters 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 which are divided for the most part into 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.600
 different growing surfaces so here 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.009
 you have stripped a little further 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.690
 you will see basil 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.399
 we could have put green beans 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.619
 tomatoes full of other things that's 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.660
 what works best and in terms 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.369
 of demonstration that's what people 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.020
 dare-dare have chosen you see these are 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.030
 very very very beautiful studies those 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.670
 we have 21 21 days we are in the middle 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 tropical very sunny and it's 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 besides, you will see ambrits 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.260
 yesterday afterwards because the sun 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 really strong here but still 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.840
 lettuce in 21 days is this 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.860
 size there is still enough 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.150
 so hallucinating to you have basil 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.729
 as you see it stopped but it's 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.619
 everything so are directly in the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.030
 aquatic environment and this kotick medium is 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.430
 loaded with nutrients that is derived from 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.750
 fish that's the system that's the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.650
 aquatonic system that is to say that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.450
 fish simply 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.130
 we find their excrement in the water 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.869
 these excrements once mixed with water 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.790
 are going to feed on plant milks 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.560
 we have several stages of evolution in 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.170
 plants that help to ensure a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.630
 rolling bearing so as to maintain 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 the load of plants on relative 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.049
 with the nutrients taken away by the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.670
 fish excrement allowing 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.760
 never go out of order if we want to say if we 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.410
 can say the system you see by these 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.570
 little buzzards out there these are the waters 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.190
 which are loaded with nitrates which 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.720
 allow to feed the plants 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.280
 you see that root systems 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.049
 is pretty interesting that it's nice 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.819
 to see it we grow plants 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.530
 out of 10 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.409
 polystyrene plates that are 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.749
 directly into the arrival liquid on 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.510
 obviously has a basil or a salad 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.590
 lettuce has many roots 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.930
 deeper but there we do not need 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.230
 to get so deep since the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.650
 nutrients are directly brought ddd 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.900
 plants 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.969
 you see that the plants are doing very well 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.790
 well the name no disease they are 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.079
 perfect health and then the bins are 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.290
 not so deep that we have about 20 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.260
 centimeters of water is behind her a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.790
 once once dry and well these crops 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.840
 leaves to a kind of sediment like 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.389
 you see it that can be very useful 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.519
 to improve a compost or improve 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.169
 a land you have a bubble system 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.959
 of air that oxygenates the water is 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.730
 fundamental obviously to aerate the water and 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.739
 is what we can see 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.890
 so we use everything 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.310
 simply small and small 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.600
 plantu there that came from little bit 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.940
 potting of teeth that come from 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.319
 garden centers in general in any case for 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.850
 these but who cleans himself 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.040
 gradually and then who make their 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.780
 root system then there is a 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.930
 filtration system of course on 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.190
 these large scale systems 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.430
 it's not mandatory on small 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.930
 chardin systems we'll say but about 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.989
 on big systems like that it's 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.380
 almost mandatory then we have we have 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.390
 several types of filtration in a 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.860
 first time we will find a 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.900
 mechanical filtration 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.610
 we will try to remove the majority of 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.420
 facts that's what would seal up a little 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.940
 little plant roots 6 6 2 if 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.160
 was going a little further and then so 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.950
 the effect sations bring my be led by 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.080
 through his pipes 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.910
 towards a composter we could have 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.819
 very well imagine to value these 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.040
 facts is sedan 1-1 vermicompost 1 which 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.140
 would produce greens that 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.670
 would in turn feed the fish that's 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.530
 trials that will be conducted soon to 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.440
 art daou that were conducted and who 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.700
 are still being experimented 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.990
 we have a second type of filtration that 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.940
 is a biological filtration 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.000
 ie infiltration by the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.729
 bacteria that's it's another one a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.560
 another mechanical filter and then we use 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.750
 the net just to keep you 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.400
 a majority of two materials in 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.450
 suspension 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.669
 and then behind and filtration 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.260
 biological thanks to bacteria 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.910
 now we arrive on the part 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.210
 fish since it's still the basis 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.520
 of the system so the fish are high 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.320
 in groups as you see who 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.190
 are bins that are about 5-6 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.290
 cubic meters 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.820
 and then inside there is then 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.830
 they are very much arrived at obviously 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.460
 the needs of the needs of the fish 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.620
 are are important at this level so 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.680
 and if we find tilapia tilapia case 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.600
 that a fish dock that is very 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.000
 advantageous for breeding at the meeting 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
 we can no longer introduce species 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.600
 in this island so we're happy 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.639
 what we have on hand and what has already 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.880
 been introduced elky the apia is very suitable 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.139
 well 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.210
 good food and then there are these rustic 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.160
 like like fish so so it's going very 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.500
 well who the red stone on one side 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.900
 tilapia grate the other I'm not a 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.160
 great connoisseur of tilapia but you 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.479
 recognize them then there you see makes 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.789
 feeds based on pellets but one 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.900
 can very well imagine feeding them to 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.820
 base of 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.280
 other organic products 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.220
 on the farm we can we can close 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.900
 the loop if you wish 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.460
 if these fish are in perfect health at 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.530
 closed that it will have been brought back to summer all 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.580
 First the help of responsible 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.050
 ammonia that were in the 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.540
 made that fish 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.190
 it has been turned into nitrites and 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.320
 then they were together in nitrates 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.730
 by biological action and then 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.830
 assimilated by the plants that are going 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.060
 so restore clear water for 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.120
 raising these fish so 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.390
 quite completely healthy 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.390
 Thank you for your attention
