00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.049
 even Narita Speller Whatever there is Hariri but thought Dieter Schwarz 

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:32.420
 But she just had to leave mine 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.249
 and the money percent 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.570
 the crime series 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.740

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.650
 such a silver-gray 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.400

 book guest here also Kikis market is 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.660
 Percent yes and I have some applied 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.680
 good that it washed off by 18% 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.390
 and it's always euro so 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 Critics noticed at the line 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.259
 Buys with Ole products and has never tried around there I think if you 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 Lust for rehearsal because the therapy can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.670
 I already noticed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.670
 the most notable ones have a bit of a cool down 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.090
 I have been visiting for two weeks 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.070
 have the weight control 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.940
 translates that means ng 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.890
 they know me then I did not think you have to do it now 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.360
 do 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 So they are certainly not out 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.899
 and it works 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.650
 as hippies in a week 1 2 8 kilo Corp. Aachen gives 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.770
 tilt 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 To be received in March I am already very sad to be through 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.740
 so that I once again a handsome 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.980
 figure 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.890
 that they have deposited to lock 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.090
 Euro that awakens 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.219
 So you save a pillow like the one everywhere 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.979
 I do that now too 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.219
 and so named question was from Thun 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.819
 Ciba tuba trumpet 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.660
 poetry 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.370
 hopefully this will make billions of dollars a relieved Nienhaus 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.379
 I'll tell you the best here in Aachen 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.569
 Maybe her cheek knows you've hit her 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.319
 completely foreign as the others everyone out here 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.640
 February have 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.640
 spectator 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
 there you can stand with the canal 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.969
 now I am only one thing to be he comes from the public part of one 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.679
 Move the line 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.359
 The Gates Foundation is all the more 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.129
 the Caritas speaks to the head of the unknown with thoughtful ones 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.159
 our goal 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.129
 also 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.129
 I can always do something different my own 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.139
 both are not in a top team and then they will always be 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.409
 ships are coming again 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.749
 to make corresponded as usual to do with war 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.340
 make the strict do not make it all quite slow 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.639
 maybe even points and afterwards using one 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.169
 So that's better training for you now is a few male 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.739
 Dhabi at 11 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.150
 initially 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.340
 Practicing practice means practicing the power percent needed to be a plattner 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.499
 the rich developed started 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.289
 At that time as Miss Tragedy duty both Turkish women have fun 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.659
 at the earliest Uhrmann the part creeps 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.729
 empty until the end 02 Unkrich did not even joke 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.480
 just 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.919
 now would have to be wife 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:56.509
 that mediates Miltenberg PI in front of the BSC woman as tap Franconia 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.319
 after the Christmas and Advent songs 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.899
 Kreon a unicycle 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.069
 so plans off 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.069
 for each other 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.370
 yes, they always have a very long time 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.080
 and with that you can relate a percent there were quite easy dash there 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.479
 mostly kicking 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.479
 come back is not seen 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.460
 and the FOMC that has been possible so you can not forseen as necessary 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.259
 the trend can last from approx 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.340
 around 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.860
 some had Red 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 So in the 1 quite happy to cope 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.599
 is borrowing such a fluid 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.659
 "This is a pool a Reiner and the Middle Ages fire 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.449
 next to the Kindle 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.259
 it's a bit tapered 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.309
 Kokott man 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.309
 covered with the canon 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.370
 and looks dashed month 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.580
 finally the churches where 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.050
 not in the squad 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.889
 depending on more 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.889
 the idea is 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.479
 So the story is one of the best 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.999
 crash with the unit on the cheek 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:13.040
 a start 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.779
 these little strokes t 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.559
 to do it 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:20.409
 for 8 even so well knit right and then 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.099
 and as it usually does 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.129
 he leaves this heritage that you supporters if you do that in the free 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.789
 Nature looking at Battery Shikoku won my sister slightly positive 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:29.449
 Smolik 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.509
 Herten 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.289
 the orbis are still there to say 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.159
 I think I have missed the third floor since long forgotten 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.229
 against Egypt 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.719
 by no means 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.180
 Ulm 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.820
 30 0 whether concerns in euros 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.249
 it costs 68 euros 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.249
 In India, this is the case in the concrete case 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:56.559
 we did not succeed 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.730
 that could also become a new car 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.839
 become 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.259
 in the stone house do what the best I can cope with honestly I can 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.259
 best to cope with the brush 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.249
 knowledge gaps 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.460
 As the only top-ten professional, I can sort of have concerns 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.639
 how do I prepare with a point well resolved weekend 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.639
 to see you keep Mainburg 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.379
 I think I will never be done 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.119
 and that is entrusted to a friend and I am looking forward to it has a tih hee
