00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I'm really excited about that so i will

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.150 
I'm really excited about that so i will
film<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.340> day<00:02:11.370> at<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
film all day at that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.370 
film all day at that
it<00:02:12.730> seemed<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.090> go<00:02:13.150> down<00:02:13.330> well<00:02:13.510> last<00:02:13.720> time<00:02:13.960> so

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
it seemed to go down well last time so

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.830 
it seemed to go down well last time so
it's<00:02:15.220> better<00:02:15.370> than<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.640> quiet<00:02:15.880> channel<00:02:16.300> anyway

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
it's better than a quiet channel anyway

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's better than a quiet channel anyway
so<00:02:17.710> those<00:02:18.130> are<00:02:18.370> two<00:02:18.400> things<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.940> should<00:02:19.000> start

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
so those are two things you should start

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240 
so those are two things you should start
looking<00:02:19.450> out<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:20.110> i<00:02:20.320> will<00:02:20.740> post<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.100> video

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
looking out for i will post a video

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.850 
looking out for i will post a video
after<00:02:21.820> asylum<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.390> daleks<00:02:22.600> but<00:02:23.380> obviously

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
after asylum of the daleks but obviously

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.620 
after asylum of the daleks but obviously
i<00:02:23.980> won't<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.340> able<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.580> spoil<00:02:24.850> anything<00:02:25.300> will

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
i won't be able to spoil anything will

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.300 
i won't be able to spoil anything will
pretty<00:02:25.900> much<00:02:26.050> there<00:02:26.380> anything<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> matter
