00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.930
 inspired by the tablet that brings our 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.410

 channel of stefany hernandez girls 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 greetings hugs and let's start with this 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 tutorial I have this magazine that is of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.040
 a store here in the united states 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.559
 that is promoting some are 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.210
 some cellular service companies 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.970
 so then we see that there are colors here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 that we can recycle then I'm 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.850
 looking also to cut them 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.340
 applications of the tablet and then we put 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.770
 here it is simply a matter of cutting 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.170
 and be at the time of decoration 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.820
 but now what I did flave I started to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.090
 search for 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 a color similar to a dark color and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.160
 well I found here then draw the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 same design but a little smaller 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.009
 to be able to give it the edge 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.600
 and then I'm going to give them the measurements 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.250
 approximate so that you can 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.900
 do what 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.900
 let's see centimeters 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.270
 This is the widest part 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.630
 it is the narrowest part 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.440
 and the tree 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.830
 so that more or less a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.720
 reference of the size that has to be 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.479
 and then let's cut what we were going to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.399
 paste it on the foam and or the cardboard 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.710
 that is using I have this 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.700
 cold silicone and you buy from the other 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.270
 but I found so 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.769
 let's do it here it's cropped 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.010
 As you can see, it 's a little bit smaller than 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:22.620
 your back and then now I 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.269
 I have this piece of the outfit that I bought 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.400
 for trolley and what I did was a 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.170
 rectangle that is obviously going to be a lot 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.459
 thinner so I'm going to cut him 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.159
 I'm going to paste 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.040
 there are boys and girls the trim 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.840
 I paste it but it is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
 optional if you want you do not put the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.409
 rectangle and just hit the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.760
 applications on the lobelle I wanted 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.920
 put it rectangle then now 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.920
 cut out some small applications of the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.650
 magazine I'm going to cut out the mobile and I'm going to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.560
 paste it with the help of silicone and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.629
 Well, I show it to you and you can do it 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.639
 see already the applications are pasted 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:02.670
 with cold silicone can differentiate that 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.099
 this has the rectangle in gray and 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.409
 this one does not look a little simpler if 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.769
 that you can choose how to do it I do not 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.299
 I have the music logo at this time 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.040
 so I put him in the same magazine 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.620
 cut two popular brands of 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.650
 cell phones and tablets and also here 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.470
 at the rear 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.540
 I have put a sticker or sticker of 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.170
 a heart of goal already and the detail of the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.329
 camera and the camcorder still 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.569
 I'm going to put it in transparent color is 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.750
 possible you still do not decide to do this 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.069
 he put him in detail back but that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.230
 will be for me tonalities and that therefore 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.540
 the different brand and there are the details 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.730
 of the camera and then if you change color 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.709
 as you can see here I have one that is going to 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.019
 be for me great and the other will be for 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.790
 me lagoon and that's all guys and girls 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.790
