 these for the players 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.790
 in 1994 the launch of playstation 1 has 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.150
 forever changed the way i see 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.150

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.910
 seen as mere toys 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.699
 technology with playstations become 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.470
 real recreation centers 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.300
 of the apartment if playstation not 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.160
 had the probably never existed 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.019
 video game would never become a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.670
 mass phenomenon and never would 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.670
 had the boom we all know 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.710
 if playstation had never existed 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.570
 probably at the consoles 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.850
 would still work with cartridges 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.129
 in fact after the experiments of the triduum 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.309
 eder sega saturn on play station ad 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.390

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.430
 subsequently complex and are two

 the blu ray standard the support of 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.140
 often underestimated storage is in 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.119
 actually one of the true pivots of success 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.830
 of playstation and thanks to his 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.270
 far-sighted policy if different 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.190
 software houses have decided to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.240
 develop for the playstation newcomer 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.270
 playstation started a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.880
 technical revolution in which the 3d is a 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.920
 service of the game design se playstation 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.539
 had it never existed we would never have 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.539
 known or moved in

 we are the generation that lives 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.800
 holding a dual shock to save 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.660
 needs the memory card that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
 turns the console upside down because of this 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.930
 works better 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.670
 we are the generation we are 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.050
