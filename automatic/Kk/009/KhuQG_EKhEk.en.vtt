00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
textures teamed up with Sally's and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.720 
textures teamed up with Sally's and
they're<00:02:13.770> able<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.190> these<00:02:14.310> in-store<00:02:14.700> events

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
they're able to do these in-store events

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.520 
they're able to do these in-store events
because<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.989> best<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> learn

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
because it is the best way to learn

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.720

not revert back to curly without
submerging<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.720> water<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.260> not<00:03:43.320> like

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
submerging it in water so it's not like

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.050 
submerging it in water so it's not like

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
if you go out in the rain or you are in

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.060

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
a high humidity setting it's not going

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.530 
a high humidity setting it's not going
to<00:03:47.130> puff<00:03:47.519> up<00:03:47.640> into<00:03:47.880> an<00:03:47.970> afro<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.329> you've

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
to puff up into an afro and you've

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.000 
to puff up into an afro and you've
wasted<00:03:48.690> all<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:48.959> time<00:03:49.109> straining<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.769> and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
wasted all that time straining it and

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.289 
wasted all that time straining it and
