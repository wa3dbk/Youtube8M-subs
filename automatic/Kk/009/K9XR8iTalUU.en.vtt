00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.560
 that mothers here we are in a video more 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.540
 this time we're in minecraft for 360 and 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.429
 Today I'm going to show you how to clone 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.690
 materials such as gold , iron and 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.240
 diamond can also be with the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.760
 lapis lazuli I do not know if this can be done 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.269
 for the computer or the playstation 3 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.820
 but you can for the xbox 360 or the 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.289
 less until now and the process is 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.509
 have the first inventory space 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.759
 empty and in the second have the peak as 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.920
 I have here the heller inventory 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.469
 ordered right now what you have to 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.239
 to do is put the cube on the floor of 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.860
 iron that we do have to have the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.780
 even if it's a cube from any 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.760
 material we put it on the ground what 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.500
 we chop we put them in the first space 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.930
 food and just before the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.199
 character pick up the bucket from the ground 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.910
 we touch the button to place block and so 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.579
 we are not going to stay a block in the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.500
 hand and one on the floor this process 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.250
 it's hard to do it at the beginning but 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.690
 when we achieve so to speak 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.530
 learn them we will be doing it to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.550
 every time well and I'm sorry bald but you 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 you're going to fuck 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.420
 Now I'm going to do it with the diamond to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.000
 that they see that if you can 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.580
 we chop changed to the first space and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 let's place block if someone in from 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.720
 playstation3 is watching this video and it 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.050
 can you please tell me in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.660
 the comments so that they all know 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.090
 those of playstation and as you see we change 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.490
 to the first one and we put it and we should 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.680
 turn at the beginning to do it so that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.830
 then do not say it does not come out or I do not know 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.350
 that they practice a lot and now we are going to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 move to gold as the picamos change 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.230
 the first one and it comes out quite 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.910
 we know how to do as I said and if 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:50.280
 served the video comment subscribe 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.600
 those who are not if they want and if not 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.150
 liked comment why they did not like the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.620
 video and I do not recommend doing this for a 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.660
 survival world that we already go 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.340
 pretty advanced because I would screw up the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.050
 game itself but everyone does what 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.580
 he pleases with his world I can say 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.770
 that when we have some hand 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 we have to go to the inventory to create 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.460
 one thing and we do the crazy ingots 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.790
 because if it's not going to serve and we lose the 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.790
 Cube
