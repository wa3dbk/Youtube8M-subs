00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
could do a trim a little bit off the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.469 
could do a trim a little bit off the
edge<00:01:33.630> maybe<00:01:33.960> an<00:01:34.200> inch<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.119> keep<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
edge maybe an inch you know keep the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240 
edge maybe an inch you know keep the
angle<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.200> you'd<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.530> maybe<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> little

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
heavier layering throughout the haircut

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
heavier layering throughout the haircut
that<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> first<00:01:42.630> option<00:01:42.920> another

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that would be the first option another

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
that would be the first option another
option<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.759> soften<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.659> face<00:01:45.929> shape

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
option to soften up the face shape

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
option to soften up the face shape
because<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.429> more<00:01:47.580> square

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
because you are a little more square

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
because you are a little more square
around<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> edge<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:49.289> be<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.100> maybe

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
around the edge would be to do maybe

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.950 
around the edge would be to do maybe
above<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> weight<00:01:51.210> line<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.690> below

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
above with the weight line right below

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.139 
above with the weight line right below
it<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.069> of<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.459> these<00:01:53.549> layers<00:01:53.880> are

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it you kind of look for these layers are

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
it you kind of look for these layers are
right<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.569> that<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.049> shows<00:01:55.289> me<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
right now that kind of shows me what a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.310 
right now that kind of shows me what a
nice<00:01:56.399> Bob

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.680 

so<00:01:59.800> that<00:01:59.950> would<00:02:00.070> be<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.220> second<00:02:00.700> option<00:02:00.850> or
