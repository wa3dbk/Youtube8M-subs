some files that got corrupted on the
hard<00:00:13.760> drive<00:00:14.000> and<00:00:15.820> normally<00:00:16.820> you'd<00:00:17.240> hit<00:00:17.390> the

here and it would normally boot to the
recovery<00:00:23.689> partition<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:25.070> can<00:00:25.310> do<00:00:26.210> your

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
recovery partition and you can do your

around<00:00:32.500> that<00:00:33.500> button<00:00:33.880> no<00:00:34.880> longer<00:00:35.240> worked<00:00:35.600> it

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
around that button no longer worked it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.260 
around that button no longer worked it
seemed<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.260> you'd<00:00:36.560> hit<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.860> button<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.370> it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
seemed to you'd hit the button and it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.330 
seemed to you'd hit the button and it
was<00:00:38.420> just<00:00:38.630> doing<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.500> same<00:00:39.680> thing<00:00:39.740> as<00:00:40.070> if<00:00:40.220> you

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
was just doing the same thing as if you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.340 
was just doing the same thing as if you
were<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.580> hit<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.880> power<00:00:41.270> button<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.870> then<00:00:42.260> it

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
were to hit the power button and then it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.680 
were to hit the power button and then it
would<00:00:42.440> go<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.860> screen<00:00:43.420> asking<00:00:44.420> if<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.630> would

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
would go to the screen asking if I would

and<00:00:52.120> neither<00:00:53.120> one<00:00:53.330> of<00:00:53.360> those<00:00:53.510> things<00:00:53.750> worked

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
and neither one of those things worked

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.020

and<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:56.030> went<00:00:56.270> online<00:00:56.390> tried<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.470> find<00:00:58.030> some

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
and I went online tried to find some

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.550 
and I went online tried to find some
information<00:00:59.300> about<00:00:59.690> how<00:00:59.960> I<00:00:59.990> can<00:01:00.230> get<00:01:00.350> back<00:01:00.500> to

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
information about how I can get back to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.170 
information about how I can get back to
that<00:01:00.770> partition<00:01:01.160> because<00:01:01.520> I<00:01:01.640> had<00:01:01.730> checked<00:01:01.940> it

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
that partition because I had checked it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.049 
that partition because I had checked it
and<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.050> was<00:01:03.170> still<00:01:03.290> there<00:01:03.650> I<00:01:03.980> used<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.729> Linux

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
and it was still there I used a Linux

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.899 
and it was still there I used a Linux
disk<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.100> everything<00:01:07.100> was<00:01:07.220> still<00:01:07.340> there<00:01:07.670> and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
disk and everything was still there and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.310 
disk and everything was still there and
I<00:01:08.869> went<00:01:09.860> online<00:01:10.040> trying<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.640> find<00:01:10.990> how<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.020> fix

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
I went online trying to find how to fix

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.290 
I went online trying to find how to fix
it<00:01:12.500> there<00:01:12.680> wasn't<00:01:12.860> any<00:01:13.100> simple<00:01:13.790> solution

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
it there wasn't any simple solution

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.240 
it there wasn't any simple solution
there<00:01:14.450> was<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.630> lot<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.840> stuff<00:01:15.620> you<00:01:15.650> had<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.040> try

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
there was a lot of stuff you had to try

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.680 
there was a lot of stuff you had to try
to<00:01:16.310> do<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:18.640> doubtful<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:20.120> it<00:01:20.270> would<00:01:20.420> really

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
to do and doubtful that it would really

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.800 
to do and doubtful that it would really
work<00:01:20.930> either<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.980> got<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.030> mess<00:01:23.210> around<00:01:23.360> I

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
work either so I got to mess around I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.630 
work either so I got to mess around I
have<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.110> hyerin's<00:01:24.560> boot<00:01:24.830> CD<00:01:25.750> that<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:27.400> have<00:01:28.400> had

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
have a hyerin's boot CD that I have had

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.790 
have a hyerin's boot CD that I have had
for<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> while<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:31.550> did<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.560> popped

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
for a while and what I did is I popped

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.030 
for a while and what I did is I popped
it<00:01:33.980> in<00:01:34.100> there<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.720> turned<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.810> on<00:01:35.870> like<00:01:36.080> usual

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.090 

let<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.130> boot<00:01:40.280> into<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> CD

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.790 

the<00:01:47.520> reason<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.050> throwing<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.200> video<00:01:49.530> ups

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
the reason I'm throwing this video ups

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.580 
the reason I'm throwing this video ups
because<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:51.000> such<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.330> simple<00:01:51.660> way<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:51.930> get

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because it's such a simple way to get

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.060 
because it's such a simple way to get
into<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.130> may<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.720> fix<00:01:54.720> every<00:01:55.200> solution<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
into it I may not fix every solution you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.410 
into it I may not fix every solution you
know<00:01:56.190> every<00:01:56.430> problem<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.240> with

that kind of issue but certainly might

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.110 
that kind of issue but certainly might
help<00:02:02.940> make<00:02:03.090> things<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.510> little<00:02:03.630> easier<00:02:03.810> you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
to just do it again for the sake of
