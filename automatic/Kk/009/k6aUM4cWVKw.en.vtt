00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello so today I'm going to you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 show how to make an omelet to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.839
 base of laughing cow so let's go you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.700
 you need 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:16.379
 the olive oil of the third 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.090
 so I'm taking a break at the three 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.769
 people but we two cows who can 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:39.899
 take any mess that's 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:45.870
 completely different so cook on fire 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.020
 sweet then you'll put a little 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020
 oil 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 follows a bowl says m I'm leaving and for the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680
 second 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:47.750
 then you have got 1.9 incorporated so 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:50.140
 you will break an egg and you have 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.140
 mix 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.590
 I have to come from style a mix 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:04:08.370
 and soon the tickets were extinguished 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.370
 fire 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.590
 here 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.400
 and let it cook 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.710
 it may take a few minutes for the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.850
 cooking habits cd really takes 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.180
 not long after a fight okay 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.160
 so I repeat so we have to take a 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.160
 egg mix it with the laughing cow 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.740
 in a container 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.350
 after we put that in the pan and then 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.600
 the other two offers are incorporated into 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.210
 being fire and mixing 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:48.160
 quietly and after we cook 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.160
 so the cooking of true 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.190
 to be master finished 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.990

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.740
 here 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:29.550
 So the results of our girls 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.550
