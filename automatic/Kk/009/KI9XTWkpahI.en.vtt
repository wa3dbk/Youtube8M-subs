00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
little rush to get down okay

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.760 
little rush to get down okay
involving<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.850> top<00:00:20.060> of<00:00:20.210> involved

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.259 

if<00:00:23.190> you<00:00:23.340> cross<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.820> threshold

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
if you cross the threshold

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.480 
if you cross the threshold
should<00:00:25.630> I<00:00:25.720> accelerate<00:00:26.140> now<00:00:26.289> 300<00:00:26.949> feet<00:00:27.130> so<00:00:27.460> I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
should I accelerate now 300 feet so I

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.189 
should I accelerate now 300 feet so I
should<00:00:27.849> just<00:00:28.029> hold<00:00:28.240> on<00:00:28.449> for<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.720> minute<00:00:28.930> okay

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
should just hold on for a minute okay

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.510 
should just hold on for a minute okay
even<00:00:29.680> more<00:00:29.890> time

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
even more time

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.040 
even more time
are<00:00:31.300> they<00:00:31.419> launching<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:32.110> hope<00:00:32.379> so

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
are they launching I hope so

are they launching I hope so
come<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.410> come<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> diamonds<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.969> see

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
come on come on diamonds I can see

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.510 
come on come on diamonds I can see
I've<00:00:37.510> gotten<00:00:37.840> inside<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.860> can<00:00:39.280> see<00:00:39.399> em

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
I've gotten inside I can see em

no<00:00:42.740> no<00:00:43.510> I'm<00:00:44.510> not<00:00:44.630> launching<00:00:45.050> I<00:00:45.230> don't<00:00:45.560> know<00:00:45.740> I'm

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
no no I'm not launching I don't know I'm

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.620 
no no I'm not launching I don't know I'm
going<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.130> go<00:00:46.190> over<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.430> top<00:00:46.580> of<00:00:46.760> him<00:00:46.910> okay

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.290 

right<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.380> your<00:00:51.800> reference<00:00:52.340> point<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:53.090> going

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
right so your reference point is going

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.240 
right so your reference point is going
to<00:00:53.420> be<00:00:53.570> probably<00:00:53.960> halfway<00:00:54.620> between<00:00:54.830> the

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
to be probably halfway between the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.819 
to be probably halfway between the
windsock<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.060> LaVon

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
set yourself up with correct approach

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.380

we might be what so much okay yeah go if

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.339 
we might be what so much okay yeah go if
you're<00:02:32.180> using<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.659> reference<00:02:33.080> point

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
you're using the reference point

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.990 
you're using the reference point
technique<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.129> reference<00:02:34.400> point<00:02:34.790> was

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
technique so the reference point was

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.770 
technique so the reference point was
about<00:02:35.150> about<00:02:36.080> where<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:37.450> didn't<00:02:38.450> know<00:02:38.540> how<00:02:38.750> to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
about about where I didn't know how to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.930 
about about where I didn't know how to
be<00:02:39.019> nice<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> halfway<00:02:39.950> between<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.519> line<00:02:40.640> sock

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
be nice a halfway between the line sock

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.720 
be nice a halfway between the line sock
and<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.239> end<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.599> wrong
