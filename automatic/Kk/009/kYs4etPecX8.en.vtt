something that's so extraordinary well
with<00:00:16.139> iPhone<00:00:16.560> 4s<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.550> did<00:00:17.699> exactly<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.210> by

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that by

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.870 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that by
taking<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.590> amazing<00:00:20.189> design<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
taking this amazing design and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.560 
taking this amazing design and
completely<00:00:21.570> rethinking<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.740> inside<00:00:23.570> we

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
completely rethinking the inside we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.560 
completely rethinking the inside we
started<00:00:24.960> by<00:00:25.050> adding<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.470> dual-core<00:00:25.710> a5<00:00:26.160> chip

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
started by adding the dual-core a5 chip

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
started by adding the dual-core a5 chip
which<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> twice<00:00:28.199> as<00:00:28.439> fast

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
which is up to twice as fast

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.849 
which is up to twice as fast
then<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.060> completely<00:00:30.720> redesign<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> camera

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
then we completely redesign the camera

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.819 
then we completely redesign the camera
which<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.489> only<00:00:32.520> has<00:00:32.969> 8<00:00:33.329> megapixels<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.559> all

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
which not only has 8 megapixels but all

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.690 
which not only has 8 megapixels but all
