 it's good we can move on 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.150
 it's okay here I propose this 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.070
 video with a code that I and codes cf 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.949
 so the biggest community channel 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.719
 French, it's nice to repeat it right here 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.449
 you should know it anyway 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.350
 wake up guys 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.579
 so here we go for a good 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.739
 little gameplay him had disgusted me 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.050
 hexagonal short we left for a good 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.100
 little gameplay this is not a sport 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.539
 crazy crazy but I'm going to make a 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.039
 big series so that's why I 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.229
 proposes a code qr codes cf 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.479
 and especially for the little girl 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.649
 how to say the little news that I have 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.010
 to tell you me I think you have it 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.530
 already seen I do not know but I saw on 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.159
 internet that there would surely be 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.260
 there in 2015 finally after call of duty 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.480
 black opponent lighthouse there would be the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.130
 next call of duty who would call of 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.170
 duty world at war 2 fucking go bouya 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.330
 what a serious thing it would be a sick thing 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.320
 I'm crazy I'm crazy about this game 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.210
 there right now I do not stop there 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.130
 play at world at war 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.550
 already because it's my favorite club 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.170
 and then here I am a little I speak 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.660
 a little bit of my life and that's how 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.800
 I was able to consoles I do not read a 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.050
 console for a moment there I 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.730
 recovered a console and suddenly I 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.200
 I'm saying that since I have the console 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.520
 as much playing at world at war since 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.770
 it's my favorite game offer 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.300
 what are you going to do? 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.440
 talk about this little rumor because 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.940
 yes for the moment it is only a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.650
 rumor 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.240
 you know when we see call of duty 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.410
 not in call of duty is 27 even lighthouse 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.950
 has been unveiled we will say they 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.770
 were posted on the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.689
 the sale of the game was put on amazon the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.130
 amazon site so we can say that 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.869
 it was a leak or something like 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.060
 so the amazon site did the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.320
 bullshit to make a good escape after I 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.149
 will give you my opinion quickly but 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.709
 for me the leaks on call of duty 2 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.000
 years we did not do it on purpose 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.700
 did to find out who was going to have the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.860
 dlc there how do they know the name of the pack 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.300
 there we advance all that it is done on purpose 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 must not finally for me that's it 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.480
 activision-blizzard that what you 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.830
 do they want to do things on purpose 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.450
 leaks and then like that that's all the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.099
 world can do these videos what I 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.130
 I'm doing it elsewhere but 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.660
 in short, here is amazon here to flee a 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.160
 again so for ajinça ​​duty 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.720
 to make it had leaked and he was right 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.819
 since the game is well advance to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.430
 have to do all that and there they have to 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.410
 dropped again and would call of duty 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.470
 world at war 2 the next call of so 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.090
 after at 2 27 even lighthouses we can 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 to say that it is already too early 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.370
 since these ads and downright a year 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.760
 before but a little over a year before his 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.400
 exit 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.140
 So here it would be big but can 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 we can still believe it as amazon 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.790
 had already been right on the a27 see end 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.590
 so that's it already we can say that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.660
 it's plausible 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 then I just wanted to tell you this is 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.720
 imagine a little world at war 2 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.209
 on next gen 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.260
 imagine a little sick thing me I 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.670
 will tell you a little bit about the vision 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.200
 that I have of this game would have already been 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.359
 it's the same atmosphere second war 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.620
 world pushes at this fucking but what 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.720
 would be excellent and that weapons 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.889
 period not all that much 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.280
 equipment on weapons 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:28.359
 you do not see thousands of viewfinder 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.010
 and all lined up all that just a few 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.780
 equipment by weapon I do not know three 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.850
 four equipment per tree this would 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.459
 just fine the molotov cocktails 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.349
 who would be returning the c4 to the old 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.540
 where we shoot like on the sticks of 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.069
 dynamite fawi the little load we 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.650
 support the end I do not know how 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.329
 explain it but here it is at 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.440
 the old what like like but like 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.540
 in this world at war that's all 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.609
 simply and that's really what I 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.380
 want to find the next yoyo raid 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.260
 and this atmosphere and a little how to say 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.959
 a little 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.269
 glock a little dark here maybe 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.780
 that the reappearance of the members who 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.040
 torn up 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.349
 when you put a pump stroke in 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.239
 in the arm the braille bread or the leg 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.220
 who loses or us on a grenade 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.599
 the body exploding to I'm a little 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.829
 disgusting I'm sorry guys but 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.810
 it is true it would be excellent to 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.480
 find that there is also the fact that the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.070
 the killstreaks to sail it will be 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.579
 again for me this could redo us 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.359
 one to three five seven that is to say drones 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.400
 shelling and maybe not the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.199
 dogs but or so let the dogs 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.930
 but costs bite Chivu for you 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.600
 bute is not in one shot because the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.919
 dogs that one shot is good there is 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.020
 enough that I believe on call of duty 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.050
 ghost we have enough to eat on black 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.610
 ops the oc but here are the mullahs dogs 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.270
 would not be embarrassing if you buffoon 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.100
 twice here 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.810
 and also the game modes so 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.010
 remember on black ops from there 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.900
 really a game mode that made 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.550
 fury anyway for me it's 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.650
 really a game mode that I have 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.690
 overkilled is the strategic point 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.860
 that's after we like or we do not like 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.889
 but me it's really a game mode 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.690
 who really loves me more is for me 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.760
 is going to say that he has some skill is first 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.349
 appeared on call of duty world at war 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.460
 because on world at war you have them 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.090
 war modes the black mode that's it 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.080
 it's a bit like the points 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.520
 Strategic is to say it takes 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.870
 make an area a zone of 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.000
 stuck as the strategic weight 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.050
 except that the further you go and if you 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.389
 have taken all the checkpoints 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.229
 that's the end part so we can 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.419
 to say that it's a bit like the point 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.039
 strategic but now imagine that this 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.660
 strategic weight where this word of war 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.800
 come back to world at war 2 if 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.900
 really there is this world at war 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.389
 it would be just great to find all 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.940
 these game modes then I do not know if 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.039
 it's this atmosphere it would have been 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.419
 I want to say it would also be the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.710
 first game on the second war 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.060
 world next gen 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.010
 So here is a shot to play for 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.229
 activision-blizzard key all the brothel 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.650
 there is really a blow to play for their 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.659
 part me I'm after you I know 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.370
 I do not wait for your opinion is what you 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.229
 you would like this call of duty world at 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.990
 war 2 is what many of you 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.870
 the tenderness that voice when you 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.120
 bother your elbows completely ko must 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.949
 also say that not frankly what 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.110
 would just be excellent me I 'll be 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.970
 just right 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.280
 frankly I would be right so here it is 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.590
 we are still at the stage of rumor but 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.820
 this amazon had been good for 2 27 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.290
 even lighthouse so why are they 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.100
 would not have good for this call of duty 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.660
 world at war 2 1 why we have the right 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.670
 to dream a little bit but in any case 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.020
 that would really be my kif and I can 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.240
 you swear that there I buy it but the 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.370
 eyes closed what and yeah that's for sure I 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.930
 buy it eyes closed at 2.27 will finally 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.180
 I'm not sure to buy it because 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.420
 that is the fact that we can to can run 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.890
 on the walls with the jetpack stuff is 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.050
 or not that I fight the balls if 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.370
 too futuristic I do not like what for 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.770
 do that other entities once the 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.390
 guys there you do not shit coface 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.800
 seriously what is it 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.560
 but yeah no, that's to see you fight 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.030
 two I really hope he will not who 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.470
 will not stay at the rumor stage because 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.740
 that I would really enjoy it 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.750
 to play 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.240
 and here I wait for him I wait 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.680
 I'm waiting I'm waiting so here I'm going 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.750
 you also put the the image of the 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.580
 cover that was proposed by amazon 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.870
 so here are the email boxes since 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.040
 you know that on all jackets 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.690
 of call of duty 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.580
 there is always a soldier who is 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.920
 represented there is none so that's it 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.870
 that's why on the different 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.550
 articles I could see a subject people 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.780
 say yeah but there is no there's no 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.520
 soldiers on the jacket so it's that 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.070
 it's not true it's not that it's just 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.570
 a jacket like that proposed it can 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.290
 to be really a fake a fucking fake 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.210
 or what 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.890
 but that's why do not believe it 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.060
 would be so excellent and besides 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.710
 there was also a rumor there is not so 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.810
 long ago that where he would make a call of 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.450
 duty modern warfare collection this is at 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.760
 say modern warfare 1 2 and 3 in one 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.130
 game but apparently there would not 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.770
 the multiplayer to propose but just the 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:37.430
 solo mode and would have proposed on next 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.100
 Gen in 60 frames per second in 1080p 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.170
 in and jane what are you going to redo all this 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.630
 would be great too and here it stays 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.250
 at the rumor stage but I have 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.510
 want to believe sometimes these rumors and 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.560
 especially to see the thouars of he me 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.090
 would be a real pleasure 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.790
 so short that's all for me 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.840
 it was the story of the little rumor 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.210
 I tell you next time for others 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.889
 videos I hope 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.419
 subject code or cesm code is accepted 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:59.289
 in any case it would make me happy me 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:00.880
 you say to the next for others 

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.669
 videos take care of you eat from 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.150
 crisp apples crisps at lecci bastia 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:06.150
 at the peak
