00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 yes glass 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.389
 so it means we start shooting a new one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.710
 new restyled priors 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 Here visually she has not changed much 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.789
 If you look externally, then there is a new one 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.500
 fence do not worry on the hood open 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 bumper slightly modified but worth it 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.540
 everything seems to be in a hurry only he has already removed 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.680
 the same molding here and so it costs 409 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.850
 still this car costs 49,300 so 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.870
 appeared here let's get it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.870
 new panel is a little later 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 slightly changed the bomber already or 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.420
 Here is the back such nakladochka appeared well 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.420
 lanterns look good at night 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.010
 here 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.730
 and did not go forward and back yet 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.480
 chickens are the same we have left in principle 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.950
 those who have no eyes versed in AvtoVAZ 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.950
 it will be difficult to treat 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.620
 release 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.900
 and we already have the same doctor 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.900
 you are the same 98 horse motor 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.580
 new engine will be available in the suite 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.330
 naturally replaced me gun 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.460
 here's the collector's cabin immediately draw 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.220
 attention is a major change in the cabin but 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:58.330
 such a black cheek black ceiling 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:58.330
 upholstery i swapped so close the door 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.870
 so here we have here in principle 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.020
 This is a symbol notion when I'm correct 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.020
 understand 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.480
 loading touchscreen display 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.660
 principle i'm bye you are already a generation so 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:30.860
 quite ergonomic everything looks 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:34.430
 there is a panel here is this part quality 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.890
 plastic has not changed here and looks in 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.140
 Well, not bad, yes, that is, like 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.030
 Here on modern naturally from 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.280
 workmanship leaves much to be desired 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.920
 better but nevertheless at least 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.650
 such a decent shoot out at night will be a 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.360
 In my opinion, the board device on the date in another 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.519
 slightly changed that is but here 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.880
 tachometer 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.380
 indicate the temperature and speedometer 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.790
 fuel tank and on-board computer 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.070
 on-board computer is the same as on 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.860
 lap 2 here is the headlight control unit 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.220
 The illumination intensity is located here. 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.500
 headlight adjustment and tumanki here here 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.970
 so here as the second button is for what 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.200
 plug and drowned out the maximum speed 2 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 window lifter 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.570
 heated mirrors naturally with 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.270
 adjustable adjustable plus also 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.070
 set the complete heating lobovuhu 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.040
 there is no wiper zone 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.600
 But here you can see all these countries 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.480
 be seen 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.750
 metal cork role like on 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.080
 the grant is basically similar to here 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:45.380
 added such a line of plastic 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:47.880
 the black box is already old 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.200
 backstage this is with the backstage that is without 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.420
 cable here is heating mirrors 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.060
 ventilation control unit radio 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.160
 that is, there is even a speakerphone through 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:07.950
 bluetooth wonderful tunnel so in 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.020
 Basically, this is the opening button 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.750
 that's basically all the main difference from 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.390
 such a slave like everyone said so in 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:22.010
 principle is not much control unit 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.010
 the climate is also a little different policeman 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.790
 temperature why not temperature 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.050
 marked this level abdullah nice 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.250
 Everything is basically our main 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.610
 update which is behind in principle everything 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:43.070
 then the trunk has not changed until the blocks 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.670
 rubles, then in principle, in short 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.670
 everything
