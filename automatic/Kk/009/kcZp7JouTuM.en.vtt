00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
mistakes on the jumps but artistically I

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.560 
mistakes on the jumps but artistically I
think<00:04:02.490> that's<00:04:02.640> one<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.940> best<00:04:03.090> programs<00:04:03.450> of

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
think that's one of the best programs of

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.800 
think that's one of the best programs of
the<00:04:03.660> evening<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.670> personal<00:04:06.540> taste

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the evening is it a personal taste

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.960 
the evening is it a personal taste
though<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.170> was<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.320> little<00:04:07.560> unconventional

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
though it was a little unconventional

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.430 
though it was a little unconventional
but<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.060> think<00:04:09.270> that's<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> push<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
but I think that's the push that's the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.460 
but I think that's the push that's the
stretch<00:04:10.770> that's<00:04:11.250> what<00:04:11.580> makes<00:04:11.820> an<00:04:12.090> artist<00:04:12.510> she

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
stretch that's what makes an artist she

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.870 
stretch that's what makes an artist she
should<00:04:13.650> get<00:04:13.740> scored<00:04:14.130> for<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:16.760> here<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
should get scored for that here the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.610 
should get scored for that here the
scores<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.870> Cassano<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:24.440> don't<00:04:25.440> think

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
scores for you Cassano I don't think

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.380 
scores for you Cassano I don't think
those<00:04:25.740> will<00:04:25.980> be<00:04:26.070> enough<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.460> overtake<00:04:26.940> mr.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
those will be enough to overtake mr.
