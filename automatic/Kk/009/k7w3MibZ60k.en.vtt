hammer<00:01:40.860> forged<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.610> nice<00:01:41.820> on

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hammer forged would be pretty nice on

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
hammer forged would be pretty nice on
even<00:01:42.270> increased<00:01:42.659> stability<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
even increased stability be good in the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.170 
even increased stability be good in the

that we wanted reactive reload okay see

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.429 
that we wanted reactive reload okay see
that's<00:01:53.070> semi<00:01:53.880> tempting<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> honest<00:01:55.049> that's

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that's semi tempting to be honest that's

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.630 
that's semi tempting to be honest that's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
got reactive reload and third I so may

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.429 
got reactive reload and third I so may
not<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.939> crowd<00:02:00.210> control<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.320> got

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
have cascade and third not really

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.610 
have cascade and third not really
looking<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.780> moment<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.260> realize

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
looking for it the moment you realize

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.970 
looking for it the moment you realize
you<00:02:37.709> probably<00:02:37.860> shouldn't<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.370> gambled

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
you probably shouldn't have gambled

honestly<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.069> would<00:02:41.370> save<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.640> anyways<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
honestly I would save it anyways if I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.940 
honestly I would save it anyways if I
don't<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.870> those<00:02:43.050> roles<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.530> won't<00:02:43.709> ever<00:02:43.860> use

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it so I don't really worry about it too

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.080 
it so I don't really worry about it too
much<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.650> tempting<00:02:47.069> though<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.790> is

frequently as you would want in PvP and
I<00:03:08.850> don't<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.299> scales<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.840> hard<00:03:10.110> i

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
I don't think it scales that hard i

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
I don't think it scales that hard i
think<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.380> only<00:03:10.470> scales<00:03:10.769> up<00:03:10.920> at<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.130> six

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
think it only scales up at like six

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.360 
think it only scales up at like six
percent<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:13.080> one<00:03:13.680> damage<00:03:14.160> for

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
percent and that's like one damage for

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.340 
percent and that's like one damage for
this<00:03:14.489> weapon<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.060> don't<00:03:15.569> know<00:03:15.690> what<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.049> or

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
this weapon I don't know what it is or

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.020 
this weapon I don't know what it is or
scale<00:03:16.620> six<00:03:16.860> percent<00:03:17.220> per<00:03:17.400> something<00:03:17.880> like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
scale six percent per something like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.250 
scale six percent per something like
that<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.390> i<00:03:18.420> don't<00:03:18.630> know<00:03:18.720> how<00:03:18.870> i<00:03:18.900> feel<00:03:19.019> about
