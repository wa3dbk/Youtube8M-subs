using some yarn this is a ball it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.000 
using some yarn this is a ball it
previously<00:00:17.430> made<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.529> gonna<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
previously made and you're gonna have to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.620 
previously made and you're gonna have to
make<00:00:20.130> lots<00:00:20.400> balls<00:00:20.990> like<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.480> just

make lots balls like that so you're just

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.130 
make lots balls like that so you're just
gonna<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.970> like<00:00:26.970> creases<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.960> make

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
gonna have to do like creases to make

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.889 
gonna have to do like creases to make
square<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:30.199> then<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.439> take<00:00:31.679> your<00:00:31.920> square<00:00:34.730> and

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
square and then you take your square and

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.889 
square and then you take your square and
then<00:00:36.899> simply<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.980> push<00:00:38.879> them<00:00:39.149> together<00:00:39.420> with

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
then simply just push them together with

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
then simply just push them together with
two<00:00:40.260> sides<00:00:41.030> till<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
two sides till you have it and you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.340 
two sides till you have it and you
crease<00:00:45.899> down<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.989> nice

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
crease down and you have this nice

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.060 
crease down and you have this nice
triangle<00:00:50.840> might<00:00:51.840> look<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.199> difficult

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
triangle might look a little difficult

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
triangle might look a little difficult
but<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.730> stupid<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.820> then<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.870> fold<00:00:58.109> one

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
but it's not stupid so then you fold one

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
but it's not stupid so then you fold one
corner<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:59.430> just<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.489> friends<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
corner up just one so all my friends do

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.130 
corner up just one so all my friends do
they<00:01:03.359> put<00:01:03.570> two<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:06.140> fold<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.799> crease<00:01:08.250> down

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
they put two up fold up and crease down

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.730 
they put two up fold up and crease down
close<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.380> crease<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> other

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
close up crease down and go to the other

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.340 
close up crease down and go to the other
side<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> keep<00:01:14.460> doing<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.110 

just<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.160> that<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.910> then<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
just like that you have this so then you

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.160 
just like that you have this so then you
take<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.600> flap<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:25.380> wrap<00:01:25.980> and<00:01:26.940> then<00:01:27.120> push<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
take one flap one wrap and then push it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
take one flap one wrap and then push it
crease<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> centerline<00:01:30.650> see<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.270> do
