00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
right here on the back there is I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.600 
right here on the back there is I
believe<00:01:37.020> its<00:01:37.320> fourth<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.040> inch<00:01:38.189> plexi<00:01:39.259> and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
believe its fourth of an inch plexi and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.740 
believe its fourth of an inch plexi and
back<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.180> very<00:01:45.180> very

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
back here you can see that is very very

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.460 
back here you can see that is very very
thin<00:01:46.290> very<00:01:46.619> very<00:01:47.310> thin<00:01:47.610> plexi<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.170> does

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
thin very very thin plexi and it does

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
thin very very thin plexi and it does
not<00:01:49.710> hold<00:01:51.470> well<00:01:52.470> well<00:01:53.159> enough<00:01:53.460> compared<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
not hold well well enough compared to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
not hold well well enough compared to
the<00:01:54.689> fourth<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.229> an<00:01:55.350> inch<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.310> recommend<00:01:56.490> if

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the fourth of an inch so I recommend if

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
the fourth of an inch so I recommend if
you<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.060> decide<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.630> any<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:59.070> with

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
you do decide to do any of this go with

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
you do decide to do any of this go with
fourth<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> an<00:01:59.729> inch<00:01:59.820> yes<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.329> thicker<00:02:00.600> but

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
fourth of an inch yes it's thicker but

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.679 
fourth of an inch yes it's thicker but
it<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.439> hold<00:02:01.770> better<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.490> wear<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.450> tear

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it will hold better and wear and tear

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.100 
it will hold better and wear and tear
will<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.219> far<00:02:05.219> more<00:02:05.250> minimal<00:02:06.180> plus<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
will be far more minimal plus when you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.369 
will be far more minimal plus when you
do<00:02:07.229> cut<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.879> then<00:02:08.879> snap<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.420> by<00:02:09.810> scoring<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
do cut it and then snap it by scoring it

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.880 
do cut it and then snap it by scoring it
it<00:02:11.370> holds<00:02:11.819> up

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it holds up

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.559 
it holds up
so<00:02:12.980> much<00:02:13.160> better<00:02:13.400> than<00:02:13.610> thin<00:02:13.940> stuff<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
so much better than thin stuff this and

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.650 
so much better than thin stuff this and
thin<00:02:14.930> stuff<00:02:15.170> as<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.500> can<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:15.800> right<00:02:15.830> here

this<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.330> also<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.830> great<00:03:03.830> way<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:05.390> your

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
this is also a great way to have your

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.259 
this is also a great way to have your
water<00:03:05.720> level<00:03:06.140> maxed<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.920> also<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.670> reduce<00:03:07.910> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
water level maxed and also to reduce the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.080 
water level maxed and also to reduce the
noise<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.840> power<00:03:09.050> filter<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:10.090> which

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
noise of a power filter like this which

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880 
noise of a power filter like this which
I<00:03:11.420> recommend<00:03:11.660> more<00:03:12.080> than<00:03:12.320> anything<00:03:12.590> else

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
I recommend more than anything else

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.550 
I recommend more than anything else
except<00:03:13.640> for<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.880> canister<00:03:14.390> filter<00:03:14.690> these<00:03:15.290> do

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
except for a canister filter these do

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.190 
except for a canister filter these do
amazing<00:03:15.950> jobs
