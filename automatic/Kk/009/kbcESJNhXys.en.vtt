00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.830

 Blessed worship I was witness to the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.500
 natalie cole's ministry was 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.900
 With us it was a moment of praise and 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.670

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.370
 Praise here is very gratifying because 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.550

 this people that is growing inside and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.780
 This is wrong, we see why I 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.780
 I love to minister that because the church always 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.380
 goes there same and then the result is 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.840

 powerful move of God and we believe that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:34.530
