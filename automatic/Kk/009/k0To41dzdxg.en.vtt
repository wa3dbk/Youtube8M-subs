she actually has two magnetic bows like

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.000 
she actually has two magnetic bows like
one<00:06:24.550> over<00:06:24.730> here<00:06:25.090> one<00:06:25.810> about<00:06:26.020> where<00:06:26.320> her<00:06:26.560> bow<00:06:26.770> is

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
one over here one about where her bow is

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.510 
one over here one about where her bow is
because<00:06:27.850> the<00:06:27.940> artist<00:06:28.270> put<00:06:28.419> on<00:06:28.570> this<00:06:28.810> side

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
because the artist put on this side

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.159 
because the artist put on this side
because<00:06:31.180> her<00:06:31.270> hair's<00:06:31.509> not<00:06:31.690> routed

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
because her hair's not routed

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.850 
because her hair's not routed
directionally<00:06:32.949> and<00:06:33.610> I<00:06:34.479> ended<00:06:35.289> up<00:06:35.380> pushing<00:06:35.620> her

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
directionally and I ended up pushing her

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.499 
directionally and I ended up pushing her
hair<00:06:36.099> to<00:06:36.220> the<00:06:36.370> other<00:06:36.550> side<00:06:36.789> and<00:06:36.970> thought<00:06:37.240> that

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
hair to the other side and thought that

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.110 
hair to the other side and thought that
her<00:06:37.630> bowl<00:06:37.840> looked<00:06:38.099> weird<00:06:39.099> on<00:06:39.310> the<00:06:39.400> side<00:06:39.669> so<00:06:39.910> now

her bowl looked weird on the side so now

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.680
