on the blocks and it's really hard

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.259 
on the blocks and it's really hard
driving<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.709> it's<00:02:17.250> I'm<00:02:17.760> gran<00:02:18.060> turismo

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269

means<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:20.190> doesn't<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.910> doesn't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
means like that it doesn't it doesn't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.839 
means like that it doesn't it doesn't
walk<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.080> most<00:02:22.500> games<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.069> does<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.670> this

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
walk but on most games it does but this

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.900 
walk but on most games it does but this
game<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.989> can't<00:02:25.319> lock<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.610> goes

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
game but this one can't lock so it goes

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.280 
game but this one can't lock so it goes
downhill<00:02:27.150> all<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> way

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
downhill all the way

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.400 
downhill all the way
so<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.739> one's<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.980> little<00:02:29.130> better<00:02:29.459> but

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
so this one's a little better but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.320 
so this one's a little better but
honestly<00:02:31.410> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.640> already<00:02:32.940> have

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
honestly if you got if you already have

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.809 
honestly if you got if you already have
the<00:02:33.690> driving<00:02:34.019> force<00:02:34.560> Pro<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.610> want

idle<00:03:49.980> brake<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.880> 0<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.170> difference

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319
