00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
have it all built well we worked with

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.780 
have it all built well we worked with
Porter<00:00:39.170> brace<00:00:39.350> came<00:00:39.740> up<00:00:39.890> with<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.070> nice<00:00:40.370> kit<00:00:40.670> we

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
Porter brace came up with a nice kit we

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.640 
Porter brace came up with a nice kit we
actually<00:00:41.150> had<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.450> develop<00:00:41.780> some<00:00:42.290> products

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
actually had to develop some products

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.030 
actually had to develop some products
with<00:00:42.800> them<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.190> they<00:00:44.060> have<00:00:44.210> their<00:00:44.360> own<00:00:45.040> kits

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
with them and they have their own kits

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.990 
with them and they have their own kits
for<00:00:46.970> HDSLR<00:00:47.840> but<00:00:48.590> we<00:00:49.400> came<00:00:49.580> up<00:00:49.760> with<00:00:49.910> this

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
for HDSLR but we came up with this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.210 
for HDSLR but we came up with this
particular<00:00:50.330> one<00:00:50.720> because<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:51.830> just<00:00:52.010> really

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
particular one because we just really

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.860 
particular one because we just really
think<00:00:52.400> it<00:00:52.490> covers<00:00:52.850> all<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.090> bases<00:00:53.330> now<00:00:53.810> the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
think it covers all the bases now the

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.050 
think it covers all the bases now the
first<00:00:54.170> thing<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.950> if<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.700> look<00:00:55.850> at<00:00:55.940> it

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
first thing is that if you look at it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.580 
first thing is that if you look at it
looks<00:00:56.180> like<00:00:56.330> just<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.570> big<00:00:56.660> old<00:00:56.840> box<00:00:57.200> of<00:00:57.380> stuff

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
looks like just a big old box of stuff

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.690 
looks like just a big old box of stuff
everything<00:00:57.860> thrown<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.310> there<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:58.580> it's<00:00:58.670> a

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
everything thrown in there but it's a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.790 
everything thrown in there but it's a
lot<00:00:58.820> more<00:00:59.090> than<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.480> nothing<00:01:00.260> moves<00:01:00.410> and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
lot more than that nothing moves and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.079 
lot more than that nothing moves and
take<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.310> look<00:01:01.490> at<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.670> camera<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:03.500> is

every<00:01:27.710> time<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.010> go<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:28.370> well<00:01:28.760> how<00:01:28.880> do<00:01:28.940> you

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
every time you go so well how do you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.600 
every time you go so well how do you
adjust<00:01:29.390> for<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.900> case<00:01:30.280> aha

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610

and just sort of wedge them around it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.980 
and just sort of wedge them around it
and<00:02:12.050> then<00:02:12.200> they<00:02:12.500> become<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.190> padding

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
