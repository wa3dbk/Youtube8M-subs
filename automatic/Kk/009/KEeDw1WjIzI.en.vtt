00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
as the snow is falling it was a very

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
as the snow is falling it was a very
quiet<00:01:42.210> scene<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> grandpa<00:01:43.799> was

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

looking<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> tree<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
looking up at the tree and the way that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
looking up at the tree and the way that
the<00:01:45.570> camera<00:01:45.750> followed<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the camera followed through the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.149 
the camera followed through the
Whistling<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
Whistling and

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.649 
Whistling and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
inches.they swayed back forth in the

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.139 
inches.they swayed back forth in the
snow<00:01:49.899> in<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.140> window<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.579> was<00:01:51.609> a<00:01:51.729> very<00:01:51.880> short

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
snow in the window it was a very short

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.840 
snow in the window it was a very short
scene<00:01:52.420> but<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.840> liked<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.439> scene<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.219> lot<00:01:54.549> and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
scene but I liked that scene a lot and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.429 
scene but I liked that scene a lot and
it's<00:01:54.939> funny<00:01:55.119> because<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.869> scene<00:01:56.109> really<00:01:56.259> has

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
it's funny because that scene really has

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.870 
it's funny because that scene really has
nothing<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:56.859> do<00:01:57.069> with<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.280> story<00:01:57.549> it's<00:01:57.759> just

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
nothing to do with the story it's just

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.789 
nothing to do with the story it's just
added<00:01:58.149> in<00:01:58.210> their<00:01:58.329> beautiful<00:01:58.569> time<00:01:58.899> but<00:01:59.770> I
