00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello friends my time yes and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.330
 I was also recently asked how to play 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 solo random and even the question was wrong 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 I put and how to control the randomness but 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.039
 I'll try now 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.410
 express your vision on this problem 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.660
 First you need to understand that in the random 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.660
 plays of course hard lard and 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 manage randomly too in that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.230
 including 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.559
 but you can but you can not quite like 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.290
 effectively because all the same 15 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.489
 man and me try 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:52.620
 coordinate in a dream without communication without 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.170
 so say common goals are very difficult here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 Well first of all you need to do 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 of course you can write in the chat 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.829
 some assumptions about 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.899
 how the battle will develop and well, just 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 advise in a friendly way 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.869
 people out there on a trail like a mountain somewhere 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 don't go become what a good position where 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.990
 they should stand on the idea yes that is not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.360
 swear 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.159
 as it usually happens kindly 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 write of course for many now 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.400
 disabled chad during the fight so they 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.970
 may not hear this therefore this 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.290
 way as if ineffective but why 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.049
 and no I think half the percentage of victories to you he 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.799
 will give a plus if you will be in battle 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.200
 try to tell her how to 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 a teammate to do better 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.259
 have a friendly not swear and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.180
 in a friendly way but mainly like me 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.310
 It seems the most important thing is how it can be 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.869
 do as you can precisely manage 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 over the course of the battle it is with light and now 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.430
 I will try to explain why people who 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.219
 go play tanks especially 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.930
 evenings they come simply to relax the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.149
 there is if he went to take a rest 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.689
 by oneself 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.849
 under the beer tired he is not particularly think 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.159
 wants he wants to just go just 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.189
 shoot all this is his main goal 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.989
 of this he relaxes so after work 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:25.099
 after a hard day after even some 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.079
 problems it does not matter here and need to help him 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.480
 to make him more comfortable in the game 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.849
 play exactly play they go somewhere 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.640
 forward from the face and for that you need to do 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.220
 that you need to shine because if not 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.840
 the light is the average player 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.150
 who just came to play 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.599
 go shooting shoot it just stupid 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.489
 starts to go ahead on somewhere your 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.310
 favorite can be a place or 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.819
 or just without mindlessly go ahead and 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 merge in the first minute but if you 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.109
 if you play on light literate 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.549
 the light 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.400
 occupy a key position during the battle 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.700
 very fast to set very fast should 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.040
 be key 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.409
 not ololo light because it is well stupid 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.049
 they are all but still he will not have time 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.299
 your teammates will not get anywhere 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.230
 nothing to do namely literate light 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.660
 from key points 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.750
 somewhere to highlight the floor card 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.690
 as they say in there 1 second in 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.949
 over a long period of time so 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.150
 Here are these people who came to lose 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:34.609
 just go see what's coming 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.979
 have goals appeared as good on the map 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.659
 little red circles he's already starting 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.519
 think what for me to go somewhere 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.769
 if I can shoot a shaft 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.729
 because comrade and begins to try 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.849
 somehow already in your light work well and 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:53.510
 accordingly the pros he didn't go he didn't 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.699
 merged it may even be the second hit 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.879
 shot then eventually yes there it is well 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:01.299
 maybe even caused damage that is well in 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.769
 in the end some useful action 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.620
 but thirdly you 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.379
 but essentially directly control the move 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.329
 fight because you show where 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.740
 happens on which direction which ones 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.810
 developments 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.900
 that is, people can also navigate 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.970
 what do they do about it but i understand that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.620
 don't want to think and navigate not 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.780
 want to just shoot paint anyone on 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.510
 light that was so and give them this 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.070
 I understand that I will play like this 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.540
 a bit boring because you 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.880
 It turns out you will play purely on 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.660
 team but it is extremely effective 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.830
 at the same time here I am not talking about clearance 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.200
 as a kind of profile 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.180
 fireflies yes that is, I think it is not 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.500
 cost-effective that is inappropriate game 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.130
 dark on fireflies profile 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.260
 just because during the fight specifically 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.780
 1 light may not be enough 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.190
 and you will also need to shoot you with us 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.770
 and for how to put be hard because 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:04.690
 that you will be thrown very high and how 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.070
 would you give light but no more 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.380
 beneficial to commit essentially not 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.840
 can therefore shine best on 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.820
 some kind of dynamic and tying dynamic 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.520
 successfully that can still do damage 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.730
 if necessary, well, or some 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.030
 the pads have the same properties 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.730
 that's all that is a half-open card or 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.460
 open quite a lot in the game very 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.820
 many positions where you can correctly get up 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.690
 correctly start shining and your team 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.160
 will cease to go mindlessly somewhere 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.070
 on the contrary under the enemy as they say 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.130
 lights just merge there one two 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.380
 three four five tanks and in a row like 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.300
 herd of deer 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.210
 so let's help people 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.770
 help them with light and they will help 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.800
 you try to adjust damage 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.700
 Yes, you will earn efficiency because everything 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.520
 However, efficiency does not increase much, but 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.470
 but the percentage of victories will rise and 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.170
 rises I do not know self-esteem that 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.930
 you play all the same in the team they like 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:13.640
 most players play one against 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:17.980
 15 or even 30 well in general here 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.980
 This is my opinion thanks for listening
