00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.389
 Welcome to the second test video on the Samsung Smart TV 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.699
 I now have as you can see I was selected a function 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.689
 Take a closer look at Bocholterin and that's what's called the Smart 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.189
 this is a kind of multimedia interface 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.730
 the Samsung now installed in various devices 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.890
 and I'll show you this Smart today has the example of the TV 80 90th 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.230
 which we see here in the video 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.040
 which could also give is that this Smart ab countless functions 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.360
 Has 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.080
 that means to the animal so a kind Phil database there are different at 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.790
 the one can download 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.840
 then there's last fall and of course there are many more 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 we can scoring down here in many pages in Wiesdorf 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.000
 Of course, that's quite a lot to pack in a video 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.780
 That's why I focus on this video in my opinion 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.660
 Favorite position in there and that is the web browser because it circles above the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.330
 Samsung TV especially liked and still much better and 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.229
 easier to use than the rapper Hauser for example in the PlayStation 3 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 After the web browser started, you will find us on the start page again 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.690
 and in the rehearsal area there are different options here 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.360
 at the update field 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.090
 Startfeld was the same for us, but it does not matter whether it has been better ever since 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.230
 come back to start time 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.140
 we can choose to search for you 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.180
 Bookmark this page Yahoo Germany as a bookmark respectively 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.430
 Bereaved 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 or we can look at the course 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.050
 Here's just never been able to enter internet address so enjoyment of home 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.350
 knows 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.299
 Here you can see how many tabs are open. Currently this is one 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.680
 Here you can use the search engine of the search engine and last but not least 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.970
 there is attitude 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.530
 behind the item Settings you will find the possibility for example 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.370
 private surfing to activate means that no history is created 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.559
 or you can know and auctions as well as sold home PC 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.139
 delete the history or cookies or pop-up blocker 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.139
 change settings 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.689
 why the roar on the Samsung TV is so comfortable 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:23.459
 me now 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.080
 the whole presupposes however that one either the Galaxy s2 Lebanon 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 or the tabs have gone 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.959
 with the Galaxy s2 and the matching wii-mote ball 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.029
 we can now control the mobile phone very internally 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:44.389
 to Hermann Pierk now simply dealer of votes new boss one 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.219
 enter 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.289
 and if I enter here address now confirm 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.619
 then I get on the Galaxy only complete keyboard that is called 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.539
 I can enter the address line much more comfortably on the mobile phone than me 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
 that could be for example with the numbers Kastner remote 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.599
 then just want to watch YouTube 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.980
 The TV Council, although a built-in youtube app but um 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.819
 sometimes the text is like this 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.389
 I personally experience visors as much as you would from domestic ones 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.689
 PC simply knows about the type of Internet sites now are sometimes like 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.839
 quickly the whole lives 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.079
 so a game remains and confirmed by Peter Kern hand to shop 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.309
 that also does not look good bargain the whole load time 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.430
 so we are now on the youtube page so won the from 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.430
 home computer knows 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.399
 next i will show you my absolute favorite band this one 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.229
 browser 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.029
 and she knows that the so-called pointer mode 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.829
 we do not have a mouse pointer but it is easy to change 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.839
 with the yellow function key Troops the mouse pointer will appear 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.249
 and now comes 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.689
 if you use this KarstÃ¤dt under navigation now 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.879
 then it lets the mouse pointer steplessly steer on the screen like that 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.049
 how to bundle it for example from Karstadt of a notebook 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.900
 and that is exactly the function 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.680
 which makes the roar with the Samsung Smart TV Browser so pleasant and easy 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.160
 that means you never lose the overview where you can with the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.380
 Mouse pointer is and you can really k one on one is like the internet 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.560
 use as you do on your home PC or notebook 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.800
 Of course I do not have YouTube in vain as a test both for this video 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.230
 chosen because next to the first highlight of the simple mouse control 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.380
 Here I can also present the second highlight of the web browser to Samsung Smart TV 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.380
 that is the full flash support 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.900
 Let's have a look at my first test-video 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.240
 I give here Samsung and pirates who plug in and wanted the video 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.499
 already see 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.319
 a note after also here I have the load times cut me what is called 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.289
 you just think the world really bad luck 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.580
 Trains of the browser 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.999
 and the other degrading video what is super 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.659
 click on something 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.830
 and look at the board as fast as it lasts and what the quality 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.900
 says 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.580
 I've already tried it out can betray it is super fast and 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.650
 the quality is 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.820
 yes I would even say 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.580
 even better as you know from the home PC 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.580
 because only the size of the terrain is of course outstanding here 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.289
 Of course, while the video is playing, you can also enjoy all the comfort 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.849
 you continue to use your computer from the fight 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.650
 For example, we can change the resolution 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.029
 from 360 for example to 480 JPY 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.599
 and we can and of course that's just YouTube's mix of the 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.689
 Switching hits for the full screen mode so that the clips on the whole 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.680
 View the size of the screen 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.370
 that should have been as far as the internet browser 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.699
 and now again to switch back to the smart handed keystroke on the 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:54.889
 corresponding key 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.219
 and we are again asserting the fountains from fire before some 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:59.729
 Minutes are started 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.839
 I was once again watching him 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.950
 and I hope the next one is the third video by now 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.050
 since he joined again 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.900
 So far
