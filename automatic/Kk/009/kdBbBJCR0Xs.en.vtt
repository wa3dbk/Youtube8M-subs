crazy since the bass pond extension
isn't<00:01:18.790> holding<00:01:19.090> water<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.810> decided<00:01:20.350> to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
isn't holding water I decided to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.380 
isn't holding water I decided to
experiment<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.280> pond<00:01:21.490> ladder<00:01:21.760> concept

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
experiment with the pond ladder concept

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.130 
experiment with the pond ladder concept
using<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.410> silkscreen<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.940> purchased<00:01:25.479> for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
using a silkscreen that I purchased for

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.440 
using a silkscreen that I purchased for
when<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:26.770> was<00:01:26.950> digging<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.310> goldfish<00:01:27.850> ponds

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
when I was digging the goldfish ponds

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.170 
when I was digging the goldfish ponds
I<00:01:28.560> used<00:01:29.560> two<00:01:29.770> layers<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.520> maybe<00:01:30.790> it'll<00:01:31.000> do<00:01:31.150> a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
I used two layers so maybe it'll do a

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.450 
I used two layers so maybe it'll do a
better<00:01:31.390> job<00:01:31.479> holding<00:01:32.200> out<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.680> water<00:01:32.890> keeping

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
better job holding out the water keeping

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.210 
better job holding out the water keeping
it<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.729> rather<00:01:33.970> we'll<00:01:34.960> just<00:01:35.140> have<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.290> see<00:01:35.590> if

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
it in rather we'll just have to see if

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.150 
it in rather we'll just have to see if
it<00:01:36.430> works<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.910> I<00:01:37.210> guess<00:01:38.140> we're<00:01:38.350> good<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.710> go

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
it works and I guess we're good to go

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.760 
it works and I guess we're good to go
ugly<00:01:39.490> as<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.759> is<00:01:39.940> or<00:01:40.479> maybe<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.200> will<00:01:41.320> prove

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
ugly as it is or maybe it will prove

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.219 
ugly as it is or maybe it will prove
what<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.580> causing<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.330> leak<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:43.780> put<00:01:44.050> in<00:01:44.140> a

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
what is causing the leak and I put in a

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.810 
what is causing the leak and I put in a
real<00:01:44.410> pond<00:01:44.680> liner<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:47.770> pretty<00:01:48.460> sure<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
real pond liner I'm pretty sure the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.139 
real pond liner I'm pretty sure the
water<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.119> leeching<00:01:49.570> out<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:51.149> wetland

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
water is leeching out on the wetland

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.410 
water is leeching out on the wetland
side<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.899> left<00:01:53.050> side<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.560> video<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
side the left side in this video so

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.940 
side the left side in this video so
that's<00:01:55.510> where<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:55.780> concentrated<00:01:56.409> on<00:01:56.590> putting

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
that's where I concentrated on putting

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.080 
that's where I concentrated on putting
the<00:01:57.430> quote-unquote<00:01:58.420> liner<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:03.460> looks<00:02:03.670> ugly<00:02:03.820> as

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the quote-unquote liner it looks ugly as

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.850 
the quote-unquote liner it looks ugly as
hell<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:04.600> wish<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:05.110> could<00:02:05.260> find<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.710> better

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
hell I wish I could find a better

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:33.920 
hell I wish I could find a better

rescued from the Terra Cotta pipe that I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.680 
rescued from the Terra Cotta pipe that I
was<00:03:01.019> crushing<00:03:01.379> at<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> time<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.420> missed<00:03:03.420> him<00:03:03.569> by

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
was crushing at the time I missed him by

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
was crushing at the time I missed him by
about<00:03:03.720> an<00:03:04.049> inch<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:07.280> course<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.549> want

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
about an inch of course we don't want

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.220 
about an inch of course we don't want
him<00:03:08.819> living<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.180> our<00:03:09.299> pond<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.780> we'll<00:03:09.900> take<00:03:10.049> him

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
him living in our pond so we'll take him

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.110 
him living in our pond so we'll take him
down<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> local<00:03:11.220> pond<00:03:12.209> bigger<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:14.060> here<00:03:15.060> he

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
down to a local pond bigger one here he

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
down to a local pond bigger one here he
goes<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.920> tickle<00:03:17.370> hold<00:03:18.120> it

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.570 

well<00:03:47.640> my<00:03:47.880> ad-hoc<00:03:48.650> liner<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.980> working<00:03:50.370> pretty

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
well my ad-hoc liner is working pretty

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.420 
well my ad-hoc liner is working pretty
good<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.210> far<00:03:51.740> can't<00:03:52.740> really<00:03:53.040> tell<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:53.310> it's

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
good so far can't really tell if it's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.750 
good so far can't really tell if it's
holding<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:55.040> take<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> couple<00:03:56.310> days<00:03:56.520> for

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
holding it in take a couple days for

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.980 
holding it in take a couple days for
that<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.670> as<00:03:59.970> far<00:04:00.150> as<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.450> fill<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.900> up

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
that this is as far as I can fill it up

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.350 
that this is as far as I can fill it up
because<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:02.070> stream<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.400> getting<00:04:02.640> too<00:04:02.760> low<00:04:02.970> we

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
because the stream is getting too low we

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.510 
because the stream is getting too low we
need<00:04:03.510> some<00:04:03.690> rain

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.210
