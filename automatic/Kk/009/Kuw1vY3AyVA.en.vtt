 for pour cucumbers so need has come 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:11.040
 cucumber pickling season I decided to shoot 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:15.030
 video must be watched 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 until the end why cucumbers will 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 wonderful this recipe is very hard 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.040
 meet on the Internet 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.020
 he was advised by my mother and we are already on 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.150
 years ten we use the same 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.790
 recipe 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.079
 after which our cucumbers do not explode 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:39.359
 I promise you two hundred percent what 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 recipe simply awesome as well, that we I 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:47.339
 already put here a jar but steam to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 all our microbes are dead so will begin 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.289
 soaked cucumbers i well pre 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.390
 washed cut off plots 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 I filled it with water and at night they constantly 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 so on we have dill 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.300
 horseradish root leaves 2 garlic cloves 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 on a three-liter jar 1 clove I will cover 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.580
 by the way you will be on camera 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.910
 show a three-liter jar by example 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.020
 so citric acid salt is sugar 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.260
 before with peas necessarily root 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.090
 horseradish shelled scoured 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:34.380
 cherry leaves and currant leaves so well 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.650
 everyone drove a jar of disinfected 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:44.330
 also threw two caps boil to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.330
 they boiled over me so well okay we take 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.830
 dots laid on the bottom of the banks so at 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.250
 you should be all clean the table is good 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.890
 wash but here I am for example a wake 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:12.100
 I stack another leaf of Nicolin 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:20.110
 further stack beam accounting study was at 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:21.550
 pandas since 1 garlic throws back so 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:32.590
 we throw miss here 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:41.020
 dots cherry horseradish root leaves black 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:45.610
 currant and somewhere around the eye 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.989
 stuff 10 even can be more black 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.160
 pepper so interferes 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.800
 so well, all the rest we take cucumbers and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.310
 well lay out our jar all 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.959
 as I lay out further we continue 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.320
 lids and covered our jars now i 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.050
 I'll show you in the pan I was here 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.830
 the water I disinfect ours 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.330
 jars 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:21.430
 so do it all again merged poured new 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.470
 water and now she was boiling again here 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.060
 three-liter jar filled with me 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.239
 about half a liter of water goes I 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.510
 stocked up if water stays in 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.660
 how do we just merge what are we now 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.600
 do i will explain to you now we fill 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.500
 here boiling water leave for 10 minutes to 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.090
 all of our microbes are all other died with 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 cans we again pour water into the pot 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.860
 add one jar to highlight 3 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.790
 tablespoons 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.790
 salt and 5 tablespoons of sugar again this 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.540
 all we have affairs boil pots again we 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.720
 we fill again wait 10 minutes and in 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.470
 the third time we pour water into the pot 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.480
 but when we third time william water in 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.530
 the pot that is already finished almost 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.670
 pickle we add 5 grams of lemon 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.530
 Acid 5 grams of chickpeas about tea 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.570
 spoon without a slide 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.450
 something like this all went open 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:38.010
 cover 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:42.000
 tapnuv we no longer need and neatly 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:45.660
 little by little slowly add our 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.390
 boiling water and by the way I initially forgot 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.080
 still tell you that you can also add 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.030
 and bay leaf is desirable along with 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.810
 all the other leaves, I still add 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:07.340
 Lavrova dice all as I fill in further we 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:11.340
 so we continue the water all because of the bank 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:17.550
 so well, I repeat on the three-liter jar 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:27.860
 add 5 tablespoons of sugar can 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:27.860
 less add 3 tablespoons with the will 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.180
 add in advance and mark 10 minutes 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.229
 to pass with us 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.100
 and pour everything here so well our whole time 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.790
 and glass 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:53.960
 merge our water 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:06:15.960
 vodichku brine neatly and set 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:20.130
 brine again boil. come here so well 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:25.680
 all cars boils continue so the second time 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:27.690
 I will flood our cucumbers so now I 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.560
 weighed citric acid 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.080
 I have electronic scales pour here 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.060
 until you forget 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.180
 overall not exactly define 5 grams of lemon 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.650
 acid on a three-liter jar is a tea 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.000
 spoon without a slide i 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:48.200
 Minsk was not wrong so here we pass 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.800
 again pour into the pot again boil 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:58.020
 pour wait there minutochek 5th 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.990
 I think and you can roll up the window all 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.850
 the third time I filled we will see 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.840
 such a picture 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:09.030
 cucumbers began to darken one jar of 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.380
 rolled up flipped over with and there i'm a cat 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.540
 I 'll turn it over with something warm too 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.780
 for example a good towel or two 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.470
 towels leave for the night and all of our 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:27.930
 cucumbers can be cleaned necessarily 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:30.300
 try this recipe in it 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.020
 interesting is what i need there 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.930
 to put 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:39.090
 vinegar vinegar spoils the whole taste 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.610
 it turns out very sour nasty in 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:45.480
 Generally something WTO sausage full of one 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:48.990
 time I made about 8 cans somewhere 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.180
 three of them exploded and tasted 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.390
 turned out very disgusting general 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:57.530
 advice try this recipe will be 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.530
