00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello speaks Andrew for the laptop 10 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.650
 and today we are going to see this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.839
 application that I have here is called 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.750
 bigger and this application is going to be a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.830
 alternative to install was installed and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.330
 It stopped working 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.099
 equally and we will see this application 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.199
 but first I want to tell you that they already have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 android channel I already know that many already 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.560
 you know but well anyway here goes 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.180
 to have a link in the bottom by 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 if they want to access or also at the end 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 of the video they can do then 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 I just wanted you to know and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.689
 live in the description if you want the same 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 will be there the channel is low and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 android or youtube.com diagonal android 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.570
 so that the checks but good and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 going back to the topic here we have vision and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.630
 the truth that works very similar 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.550
 I install what it does is that we can 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.500
 download all the applications that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 we found inside the app store but 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 totally free and I had them 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.260
 taught a few methods here I'm going to 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.600
 leave anyway which are 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 100% legal download applications from 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.770
 here the only thing that is not legal is still 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.680
 it is legal to upload them, so to speak 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.600
 but good if you want to download 100% 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 legitimate of those applications that the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 can update that the downloads of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.760
 the app store I leave here some options 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 but good I feel are more want 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.510
 use bigger as it is good and good 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.370
 we are going to open the application and here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.020
 we find they are going to be different 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.170
 options have five options here until 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 the start categories downloads handle and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 more and good in what we're going to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.730
 focus will be here in looking for that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 I guess it's good if they want this 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.970
 application you already know that download 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 suppose I do not know if we would like 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.250
 angry birds we just look for it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.510
 here gives us different options for 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
 example let's find the version of 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.590
 star wars then here as we see is the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.390
 first option the only thing that we have to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 do is select the one and here we are going to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.710
 give information about the app as well as how 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.480
 it works the app store tells us its 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 description has some images and what 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.720
 only thing we have to do is here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.550
 where it says press where it says download 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.410
 then here we go to the tab 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.300
 downloads and well we have to wait for 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.950
 that the download starts if it takes and 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.320
 well here my download began but if 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.910
 I would have been slow to start the download 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.920
 all I have to do is press 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.900
 pause and play again so that the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 program recognize that but good and as 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.590
 come here started the download goes a little 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 slow then I 'm going to go back with 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.160
 the video once it is finished 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.410
 the download ok here say install 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.540
 angry birds starwars I think it weighed 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.310
 a lot and I'll be taking too much 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.070
 in installing but hey here I started to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.700
 install 360 panorama then here already 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.590
 goes in 97% then there is simply 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.000
 to wait for it to finish downloading 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.380
 but hey, I just wanted to tell you that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 I already changed the application to download 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.950
 because he did not want to lose so much 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.170
 video time but good here we go to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910
 wait for 360 panorama to finish 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.650
 let them see how it is installed 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.050
 already downloaded then here I'm going to the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.850
 download tab simply the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.010
 selected and I put to who says 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.870
 reinstall is going to start installing 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.000
 this application we are only going to 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.560
 wait for the installation to finish 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.630
 to see that the icon is already 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.670
 normal and the application will work 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.170
 ok then it's just going to wait for 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.570
 that here it already appeared to us that it was installed 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.610
 correctly 360 panorama then 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.110
 good if I go to this page and up 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.910
 here the application then if I get 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.410
 as in the application it will run to the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.010
 perfection this is an application for 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.720
 Take 360- degree photos and photos 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.370
 panoramic as you see here it works 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.310
 pretty good the application here if I 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.290
 I want I could start to try the same 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.180
 application and how they look works very well 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.680
 so good to install vision is 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.020
 very simple the only thing that we have to 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.850
 have silvia once you're in 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.500
 cydia will go here where he says handle 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.630
 once you are managing sources 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.460
 then they will press edit and then 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.530
 add once this 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.720
 window will put iphone m dotcom 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.400
 diagonal group are going to add that font 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.990
 and once she is attacked she will join here 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.790
 where it says look and they're going to look 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.590
 simply this application that is 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.510
 vision and good are going to see here 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 the selection can not be installed and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.599
 confirm and they're also going to need another 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.670
 application to work well it 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.709
 call apps and you have to download it from 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.629
 the same group of iphone yachts and not 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.800
 it may be that it works badly 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.220
 application then they are simply going to 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.519
 search for 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.700
 austin for a 5.0 plus this will work 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.019
 for ios 5 and ios 6 so I do not know 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.670
 worry about being installed in this gesture of 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.319
 nyaya vessey if it works well but this 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.790
 application only works from ios 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.739
 5 then they are from one version 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.239
 previous will not work vision 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.069
 then make sure you download this 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.110
 version of acsi and that's how they are going to 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.060
 be able to download applications with vision 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.410
 an alternative installed and well this 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 it was all as I say, subscribe to me

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.369
 to choose the five winners what I'm going 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.259
 to do is that we are going to separate the 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:00.479
 comments from 10 in 10 before appeared 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.550
 in per pages but good now every time 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.589
 you squeeze show an art throws 10 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.800
 new comments then here are 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:10.379
 1.106 which means that they are 111 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.089
 pages and should show more then what 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:14.159
 what are we going to say here to random point 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:17.369
 or heretical we are going to put a number between 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:20.459
 the 1 and the 111 and the number that goes out and goes 

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:22.319
 to be winners page number 

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:24.419
 of the comments is to say that it's going to 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.149
 leave the page I do not know for example the 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.279
 page 35 if you do not know page 35 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:31.229
 you will choose 5 cattle from that page what 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.119
 will do to choose them is that we go 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.679
 to put a random number after 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.539
 between 1 and 2 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:38.219
 and if I get 1 they are going to do all 5 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.679
 first comments on that page if I 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.129
 the 2 is going to be the last 5 of that 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:44.369
 page 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.619

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:47.580
 outgoing let's go let's go up to 55 

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.439
 this is going to put it in fast camera 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.739
 because I think it took me a little 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.389
 but hey this is page 1 page 

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:56.659

 the rest 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.930
 524 and when we are simply missing 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.270
 a page to get to page 55 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.370
