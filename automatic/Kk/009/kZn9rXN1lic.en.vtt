virtual dynamics has been using a unique

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.880 
virtual dynamics has been using a unique
convention<00:00:30.730> in<00:00:30.850> our<00:00:30.970> cables<00:00:31.360> for<00:00:32.349> several

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
convention in our cables for several

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.020 
convention in our cables for several
years<00:00:33.070> now<00:00:33.129> it's<00:00:33.370> called<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.579> speed<00:00:33.789> of<00:00:33.879> light

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
years now it's called the speed of light

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.520 
years now it's called the speed of light
technology<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.079> speed<00:00:35.320> of<00:00:35.409> light

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
technology and the speed of light

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.680 
technology and the speed of light
technology<00:00:35.829> uses<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.609> magnet<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.420> sits

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
technology uses a magnet that sits

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.720 
technology uses a magnet that sits
inside<00:00:37.839> the<00:00:38.140> conductor<00:00:38.469> itself<00:00:38.620> now<00:00:39.550> if<00:00:39.640> you

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
inside the conductor itself now if you

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.610 
inside the conductor itself now if you
ever<00:00:39.879> noticed<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.359> even<00:00:40.839> you<00:00:41.079> put<00:00:41.319> a<00:00:41.350> couple

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
ever noticed that even you put a couple

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.899 
ever noticed that even you put a couple
of<00:00:41.710> our<00:00:41.800> cables<00:00:42.129> together<00:00:42.249> especially<00:00:42.609> the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
of our cables together especially the

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.270 
of our cables together especially the
older<00:00:43.149> ones<00:00:43.179> they<00:00:43.809> want<00:00:43.989> to<00:00:44.079> tend<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:45.010> stick

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
older ones they want to tend to stick

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.319 
older ones they want to tend to stick
together<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:45.760> that's<00:00:45.879> because<00:00:46.149> there's

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
together and that's because there's

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.809 
together and that's because there's
high-power<00:00:46.870> neodymium<00:00:47.589> magnets<00:00:48.010> sitting

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
high-power neodymium magnets sitting

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.520 
high-power neodymium magnets sitting
right<00:00:48.940> on<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.179> cables<00:00:49.539> themselves<00:00:50.019> so<00:00:50.440> this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
right on the cables themselves so this

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.959 
right on the cables themselves so this
is<00:00:50.710> an<00:00:50.829> older<00:00:51.100> cable<00:00:51.429> that<00:00:51.550> I<00:00:51.609> picked<00:00:51.850> up

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
is an older cable that I picked up

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.719 
is an older cable that I picked up
somebody<00:00:52.179> had<00:00:52.589> traded<00:00:53.589> this<00:00:53.710> guy<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.339> and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
somebody had traded this guy in and and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.360 
somebody had traded this guy in and and
will<00:00:55.179> refurbish<00:00:55.659> it<00:00:55.809> here<00:00:56.019> make<00:00:56.889> it<00:00:56.920> look<00:00:57.039> all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
will refurbish it here make it look all

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.459 
will refurbish it here make it look all
Spanky<00:00:57.879> new<00:00:57.999> again<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.479> put<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.289> out<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.379> the

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
Spanky new again and put it out in the

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.259 
Spanky new again and put it out in the
marketplace<00:00:59.769> for<00:01:00.100> somebody<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.489> enjoy<00:01:00.760> at<00:01:01.210> a

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
marketplace for somebody to enjoy at a

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.599 
marketplace for somebody to enjoy at a
really<00:01:01.569> great<00:01:01.690> price<00:01:02.159> but<00:01:03.159> one<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.429> things

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
really great price but one of the things

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.789 
really great price but one of the things
I<00:01:03.760> wanted<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.299> do<00:01:04.420> before<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.780> actually<00:01:04.960> set

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
I wanted to do before I actually set

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.890 
I wanted to do before I actually set
this<00:01:05.950> cable<00:01:06.310> back<00:01:06.640> into<00:01:06.909> production<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.780> get

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
this cable back into production to get

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.960 
this cable back into production to get
fixed<00:01:08.080> up<00:01:08.320> was<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.980> show<00:01:09.160> you<00:01:09.220> something<00:01:09.850> that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
fixed up was to show you something that

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.580 
fixed up was to show you something that
you<00:01:10.000> can<00:01:10.120> do<00:01:10.450> if<00:01:10.990> you've<00:01:11.140> got<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> virtual

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
you can do if you've got a virtual

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.500 
you can do if you've got a virtual
dynamics<00:01:12.130> cable<00:01:12.430> already<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.030> you'd<00:01:13.270> like<00:01:13.390> to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
dynamics cable already and you'd like to

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.410 
dynamics cable already and you'd like to
make<00:01:13.660> it<00:01:13.810> sound<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.200> little<00:01:14.290> nicer<00:01:14.680> on<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:16.120> new

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
make it sound a little nicer on the new

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.540 
make it sound a little nicer on the new
2.0<00:01:16.990> version<00:01:17.200> which<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:17.770> see<00:01:17.950> here<00:01:18.250> you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
2.0 version which you can see here you

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.920 
2.0 version which you can see here you
can<00:01:18.580> see<00:01:18.730> that<00:01:18.970> we've<00:01:19.120> got<00:01:19.330> on<00:01:19.600> them<00:01:19.750> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
can see that we've got on them the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.870 
can see that we've got on them the
magnet<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.410> much<00:01:20.590> further<00:01:20.830> back<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.550> on<00:01:21.760> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
magnet is much further back and on the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.850 
magnet is much further back and on the
magnet<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.660> looks<00:01:22.870> like<00:01:22.990> it's<00:01:23.140> got<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.290> larger

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
magnet it looks like it's got a larger

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.860 
magnet it looks like it's got a larger
diameter<00:01:24.010> one<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.060> reasons<00:01:25.390> for<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.570> is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
diameter one of the reasons for that is

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.740 
diameter one of the reasons for that is
because<00:01:26.290> we've<00:01:26.440> got<00:01:26.650> an<00:01:26.800> epoxy<00:01:27.130> coated<00:01:27.750> steel

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
because we've got an epoxy coated steel

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.110 
because we've got an epoxy coated steel
a<00:01:29.080> ring<00:01:29.650> or<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.980> Faraday<00:01:30.520> cage<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:31.030> we

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
a ring or a Faraday cage that we

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.330 
a ring or a Faraday cage that we
actually<00:01:31.270> put<00:01:31.570> around<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.960> magnet<00:01:32.290> itself<00:01:32.560> so

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
actually put around the magnet itself so

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.860 
actually put around the magnet itself so
by<00:01:33.610> putting<00:01:33.910> that<00:01:34.000> around<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.420> magnet<00:01:34.750> we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
by putting that around the magnet we

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.710 
by putting that around the magnet we
actually<00:01:35.200> take<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.830> magnetic<00:01:36.130> power<00:01:36.640> off<00:01:37.150> of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
actually take the magnetic power off of

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually take the magnetic power off of
the<00:01:37.810> conductor<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.890> can<00:01:39.010> see<00:01:39.160> how<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.310> thing

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
the conductor you can see how that thing

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.000 
the conductor you can see how that thing
just<00:01:39.760> wanted<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.930> snap<00:01:41.410> right<00:01:41.620> on<00:01:41.800> there

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
just wanted to to snap right on there

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.670 
just wanted to to snap right on there
and<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.030> takes<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.450> magnetic<00:01:44.200> power<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.590> it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
and it takes that magnetic power and it

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.830 
and it takes that magnetic power and it
helps<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.430> could<00:01:45.610> be<00:01:45.730> contained<00:01:46.240> within

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
helps it to could be contained within

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840 
helps it to could be contained within
the<00:01:47.080> cable<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.680> with<00:01:47.800> inside<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.460> Faraday

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
the cable and with inside this Faraday

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.460 
the cable and with inside this Faraday
really<00:01:49.120> so<00:01:49.540> what<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.780> does<00:01:49.930> when<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.290> put<00:01:50.440> a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
really so what it does when you put a

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.900 
really so what it does when you put a
couple<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.860> them<00:01:51.010> on<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.460> an<00:01:51.580> older<00:01:51.880> style

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
couple of them on this is an older style

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.910 
couple of them on this is an older style
that<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:52.330> had<00:01:52.480> here<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:53.170> takes<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.650> pull

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
that we had here it takes that pull

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.070 
that we had here it takes that pull
almost<00:01:54.700> completely<00:01:55.060> away<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.690> can<00:01:55.810> see<00:01:55.960> how

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
almost completely away you can see how

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.660 
almost completely away you can see how
it's<00:01:56.230> so<00:01:56.470> easy<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.800> be<00:01:56.980> able<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.160> do<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.430> where

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
it's so easy to be able to do that where

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.620 
it's so easy to be able to do that where
if<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:58.450> take<00:01:58.480> these<00:01:58.780> off<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.300> move<00:02:01.480> them

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
if I take these off kind of move them

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.420 
if I take these off kind of move them
around<00:02:01.690> oops<00:02:02.080> yeah<00:02:02.620> well<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.830> can<00:02:02.980> see<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
around oops yeah well you can see like I

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.760 
around oops yeah well you can see like I
literally<00:02:03.850> Bend<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.540> eight<00:02:04.690> gauge<00:02:04.900> cable<00:02:05.140> no

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
literally Bend that eight gauge cable no

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.930 
literally Bend that eight gauge cable no
problem<00:02:06.070> because<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> magnets<00:02:06.670> are<00:02:06.790> so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
problem because the magnets are so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.690 
problem because the magnets are so
strong<00:02:07.210> now<00:02:08.080> what<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> magnets<00:02:09.069> are<00:02:09.220> doing<00:02:09.489> is

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
strong now what the magnets are doing is

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.640 
strong now what the magnets are doing is
they're<00:02:10.300> increasing<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.170> total<00:02:11.319> amount<00:02:11.620> of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
they're increasing the total amount of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.270 
they're increasing the total amount of
energy<00:02:11.980> that's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
energy that's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.220 
energy that's
through<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.180> did<00:02:13.360> find<00:02:13.540> as<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.900> started<00:02:14.170> to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
through but we did find as we started to

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.480 
through but we did find as we started to
do<00:02:14.350> more<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.680> more<00:02:14.710> research<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:15.340> this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
do more and more research on this

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.490 
do more and more research on this
technology<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.630> good<00:02:16.840> idea<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.350> add<00:02:17.470> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
technology that was a good idea to add a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.710 
technology that was a good idea to add a
Faraday<00:02:18.010> cage<00:02:18.040> over<00:02:18.520> top<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:18.970> magnet<00:02:19.150> so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
Faraday cage over top of the magnet so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.180 
Faraday cage over top of the magnet so
that<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.990> work<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.410> magnet<00:02:20.770> was<00:02:20.920> kept

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
that the work of the magnet was kept

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.370 
that the work of the magnet was kept
into<00:02:21.760> each<00:02:21.940> separate<00:02:22.510> or<00:02:22.660> individual<00:02:23.200> line

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
into each separate or individual line

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
into each separate or individual line
now<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.430> doesn't<00:02:24.670> mean<00:02:24.850> if<00:02:25.000> you've<00:02:25.120> got<00:02:25.150> an

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
now it doesn't mean if you've got an

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.730 
now it doesn't mean if you've got an
older<00:02:25.600> virtual<00:02:25.930> dynamics<00:02:26.290> cable<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.680> it

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
older virtual dynamics cable that it

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.250 
older virtual dynamics cable that it
won't<00:02:26.890> sound<00:02:27.150> absolutely<00:02:28.150> fantastic<00:02:28.930> because

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
won't sound absolutely fantastic because

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.560 
won't sound absolutely fantastic because
the<00:02:29.380> technology<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.190> speed<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.910> light<00:02:31.090> works

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
the technology of speed of light works

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.060 
the technology of speed of light works
whether<00:02:31.930> or<00:02:32.050> not<00:02:32.170> there's<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.470> Faraday<00:02:32.890> shield

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
whether or not there's a Faraday shield

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.740 
whether or not there's a Faraday shield
on<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.640> still<00:02:33.940> get<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.300> measured

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
on it so you still get that measured

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.100 
on it so you still get that measured
improvement<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:36.520> performance<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.810> found

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
improvement or performance that we found

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.520 
improvement or performance that we found
out<00:02:38.290> at<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> University<00:02:39.520> of<00:02:39.550> Toronto<00:02:40.530> however

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
out at the University of Toronto however

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.410 
out at the University of Toronto however
just<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> make<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.459> little<00:02:42.610> bit<00:02:42.820> nicer<00:02:43.000> you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
just to make it a little bit nicer you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.180 
just to make it a little bit nicer you
can<00:02:43.570> add<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> Faraday<00:02:44.410> cage<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.739> what<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:44.980> wanted

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
can add a Faraday cage and what I wanted

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.560 
can add a Faraday cage and what I wanted
to<00:02:45.310> do<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.520> show<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.700> how<00:02:45.970> simple<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.390> could

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
to do is show you how simple that could

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.360 
to do is show you how simple that could
be<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:46.989> we<00:02:47.140> first<00:02:47.440> got<00:02:47.680> these<00:02:47.860> done<00:02:48.160> I

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
be now when we first got these done I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.570 
be now when we first got these done I
took<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.270> steel<00:02:49.930> ring<00:02:50.500> like<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.250> we<00:02:51.400> put

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
took a steel ring like this and we put

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.150 
took a steel ring like this and we put
it<00:02:51.670> over<00:02:51.730> top<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.540> we<00:02:52.690> did<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> few<00:02:53.590> tests<00:02:53.860> just

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
it over top and we did a few tests just

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.010 
it over top and we did a few tests just
testing<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.850> steel<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.270> it's<00:02:55.420> good<00:02:55.570> idea<00:02:55.660> to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
testing this steel now it's good idea to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.979 
testing this steel now it's good idea to
space<00:02:56.380> this<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.950> such<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> way<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.209> steel

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
space this in such a way that this steel

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.380 
space this in such a way that this steel
ring<00:02:59.290> comes<00:02:59.709> completely<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.760> there's<00:03:01.000> nicely

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
ring comes completely and there's nicely

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.120 
ring comes completely and there's nicely
centered<00:03:01.780> over<00:03:01.930> top<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> cable<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:03.070> can

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
centered over top of the cable you can

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.220 
centered over top of the cable you can
see<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.640> isn't<00:03:03.790> here<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:04.600> but

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
see that it isn't here on this one but

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.410 
see that it isn't here on this one but
if<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.560> was<00:03:05.680> ideally<00:03:06.550> we'd<00:03:07.000> want<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.239> build

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
if it was ideally we'd want to build

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.729 
if it was ideally we'd want to build
this<00:03:07.540> up<00:03:07.600> with<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> little<00:03:08.260> bit<00:03:08.380> more<00:03:08.530> heat

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
this up with a little bit more heat

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.710 
this up with a little bit more heat
shrink<00:03:09.010> or<00:03:09.220> some<00:03:09.430> tape<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.209> when<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.540> put

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
shrink or some tape so that when you put

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.530 
shrink or some tape so that when you put
this<00:03:10.840> over<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.680> ring<00:03:12.550> would<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:12.940> centered

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
this over this ring would be centered

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.259 
this over this ring would be centered
completely<00:03:14.200> on<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.920> cable<00:03:15.280> okay<00:03:15.820> that'll

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
completely on the cable okay that'll

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.759 
completely on the cable okay that'll
just<00:03:16.390> help<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.840> able<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.049> keep<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
just help to be able to keep the

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.930 
just help to be able to keep the
magnetic<00:03:18.430> field<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.989> check<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.549> help<00:03:21.850> it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
magnetic field in check and and help it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.340 
magnetic field in check and and help it
be<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.090> little<00:03:22.239> bit<00:03:22.360> more<00:03:22.600> linear<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:23.080> far<00:03:23.260> as

be a little bit more linear as far as
the<00:03:23.440> magnetic<00:03:23.799> field<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.100> concerned<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.480> what

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the magnetic field is concerned so what

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.539 
the magnetic field is concerned so what
I've<00:03:26.350> done<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.590> went<00:03:27.040> down<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> hardware

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
I've done is went down to the hardware

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.979 
I've done is went down to the hardware
store<00:03:27.760> because<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:28.390> is<00:03:28.510> something<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.840> you

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
store because this is something that you

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.720 
store because this is something that you
can<00:03:29.170> easily<00:03:29.290> purchase<00:03:29.830> it's<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.220> galvanized

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
can easily purchase it's a galvanized

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.060 
can easily purchase it's a galvanized
steel<00:03:30.760> fitting<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.810> almost<00:03:32.620> any<00:03:32.799> hardware

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
steel fitting and almost any hardware

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.009 
steel fitting and almost any hardware
store<00:03:33.220> would<00:03:33.519> carry<00:03:33.760> them<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.480> galvanized

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
store would carry them and galvanized

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.380 
store would carry them and galvanized
steel<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.680> course<00:03:35.920> very<00:03:36.130> ferrous<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:37.030> so

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
steel is of course very ferrous and so

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.670 
steel is of course very ferrous and so
if<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.600> pop<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.959> against<00:03:38.230> there<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.440> can<00:03:38.560> see

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
if I pop it against there you can see

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.830 
if I pop it against there you can see
that<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:38.920> sticks<00:03:39.160> real<00:03:39.370> well<00:03:39.549> these<00:03:40.090> are<00:03:40.330> only

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
that it sticks real well these are only

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.720 
that it sticks real well these are only
a<00:03:40.959> few<00:03:41.200> cents<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.560> buy<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.010> one<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.579> things

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
a few cents to buy and one of the things

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.670 
a few cents to buy and one of the things
that<00:03:42.850> we've<00:03:42.970> wanted<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.720> share<00:03:44.650> with

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
that we've wanted to do is share with

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.650 
that we've wanted to do is share with
you<00:03:44.950> tips<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.430> tweaks<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.790> are<00:03:45.970> really

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
you tips and tweaks that are really

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.590 
you tips and tweaks that are really
inexpensive<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:48.390> cost-efficient<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.510> be

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
inexpensive and cost-efficient to be

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.509 
inexpensive and cost-efficient to be
able<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.750> do<00:03:49.930> if<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.680> take<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.070> galvanized

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
able to do if you take the galvanized

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.340 
able to do if you take the galvanized
steel<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.329> put<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.660> over<00:03:52.750> top<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.110> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
steel and you put it over top of the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.319 
steel and you put it over top of the
cable<00:03:53.560> you'll<00:03:54.400> notice<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.030> does<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
cable you'll notice that it does the

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.039 
cable you'll notice that it does the
same<00:03:55.540> thing<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:56.250> our<00:03:57.420> epoxy<00:03:58.420> coated<00:03:58.870> steel

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
same thing is our epoxy coated steel

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.680 
same thing is our epoxy coated steel
cage<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.500> we<00:03:59.560> have<00:03:59.680> here<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.970> creates<00:04:01.510> a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
cage that we have here it creates a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.780 
cage that we have here it creates a
Faraday<00:04:02.680> cage<00:04:02.709> right<00:04:03.280> over<00:04:03.459> top<00:04:03.579> of<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
Faraday cage right over top of the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.690 
Faraday cage right over top of the
magnet<00:04:04.120> now<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.110> course<00:04:05.320> we<00:04:05.950> believe<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.489> it

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
magnet now of course we believe that it

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.370 
magnet now of course we believe that it
would<00:04:06.820> be<00:04:06.940> nice<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.450> can<00:04:07.600> kind<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.140> brush

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
would be nice if you can kind of brush

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.600 
would be nice if you can kind of brush
that<00:04:08.410> up<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.829> make<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.040> look<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.280> little<00:04:09.400> bit

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
that up and make it look a little bit

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.850 
that up and make it look a little bit
better<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.299> taking<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.959> bit<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.650> heat<00:04:11.829> shrink

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
better so taking a bit of heat shrink

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.759 
better so taking a bit of heat shrink
and<00:04:12.250> putting<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:12.549> over<00:04:12.730> top<00:04:13.290> could<00:04:14.290> allow<00:04:14.709> that

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
and putting it over top could allow that

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.940 
and putting it over top could allow that
to<00:04:15.430> be<00:04:15.549> quite<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.450> bit<00:04:16.630> nicer<00:04:16.810> looking<00:04:17.260> now<00:04:17.829> of

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
to be quite a bit nicer looking now of

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.159 
to be quite a bit nicer looking now of
course<00:04:18.510> we're<00:04:19.510> just<00:04:19.750> showing<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.140> how

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
course we're just showing you how

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.760 
course we're just showing you how
quickly<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.830> do<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.070> here

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:41.409 

what<00:04:25.770> moved<00:04:26.039> on

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.079 

so<00:04:42.419> now<00:04:42.989> we<00:04:43.049> got<00:04:43.259> a<00:04:43.289> completed<00:04:43.859> Faraday<00:04:44.849> cage

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:45.089 
so now we got a completed Faraday cage

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:46.789 
so now we got a completed Faraday cage
now<00:04:45.269> you<00:04:45.329> don't<00:04:45.539> have<00:04:45.779> to<00:04:45.839> have<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.649> heat

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:46.799 
now you don't have to have the heat

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:48.379 
now you don't have to have the heat
shrink<00:04:46.949> on<00:04:47.189> top<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.819> it<00:04:47.909> in<00:04:47.969> order<00:04:48.119> for<00:04:48.179> it<00:04:48.329> to

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
shrink on top of it in order for it to

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.029 
shrink on top of it in order for it to
do<00:04:48.599> its<00:04:48.629> job<00:04:48.959> it<00:04:49.379> just<00:04:49.559> makes<00:04:49.709> it<00:04:49.799> look<00:04:49.919> a

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
do its job it just makes it look a

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.189 
do its job it just makes it look a
little<00:04:50.189> bit<00:04:50.369> better<00:04:50.489> and<00:04:51.179> of<00:04:51.299> course<00:04:51.539> this<00:04:51.989> is

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
little bit better and of course this is

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.349 
little bit better and of course this is
just<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.619> tweak<00:04:53.189> we<00:04:53.399> really<00:04:53.849> recommend<00:04:54.299> that

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:54.359 
just a tweak we really recommend that

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:55.879 
just a tweak we really recommend that
you<00:04:54.479> take<00:04:54.689> a<00:04:54.719> look<00:04:54.899> at<00:04:55.049> all<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.439> the<00:04:55.529> special

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
you take a look at all of the special

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.189 
you take a look at all of the special
features<00:04:55.919> that<00:04:56.699> we<00:04:56.849> have<00:04:57.029> in<00:04:57.239> the<00:04:57.299> master<00:04:57.659> 2.0

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
features that we have in the master 2.0

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.899 
features that we have in the master 2.0
but<00:04:58.679> if<00:04:58.799> you'd<00:04:58.919> really<00:04:59.189> like<00:04:59.309> to<00:04:59.459> just<00:04:59.489> try

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
but if you'd really like to just try

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.489 
but if you'd really like to just try
what<00:05:00.149> we're<00:05:00.269> doing<00:05:00.509> and<00:05:00.719> you've<00:05:01.109> got<00:05:01.289> some

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:01.499 
what we're doing and you've got some

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.229 
what we're doing and you've got some
spare<00:05:01.739> time<00:05:01.769> and<00:05:02.219> a<00:05:02.279> couple<00:05:02.459> of<00:05:02.669> spare<00:05:02.909> pennies

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:03.239 
spare time and a couple of spare pennies

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:04.759 
spare time and a couple of spare pennies
on<00:05:03.359> you<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.689> you<00:05:04.169> can<00:05:04.349> go<00:05:04.469> down<00:05:04.589> to<00:05:04.649> the

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:04.769 
on you and you can go down to the

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:06.019 
on you and you can go down to the
hardware<00:05:05.129> store<00:05:05.189> and<00:05:05.399> get<00:05:05.639> something<00:05:05.849> like

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
hardware store and get something like

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.359 
hardware store and get something like
that<00:05:06.059> galvanized<00:05:06.799> nipple<00:05:07.799> that<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:07.979> showed<00:05:08.219> you

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:08.369 
that galvanized nipple that I showed you

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:10.219 
that galvanized nipple that I showed you
there<00:05:08.549> go<00:05:08.969> ahead<00:05:09.119> and<00:05:09.239> try<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.659> out<00:05:09.749> I<00:05:09.989> put<00:05:10.169> it

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
there go ahead and try it out I put it

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.599 
there go ahead and try it out I put it
over<00:05:10.409> top<00:05:10.529> your<00:05:10.739> cables<00:05:11.069> and<00:05:11.189> see<00:05:11.339> what<00:05:11.489> your

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:11.609 
over top your cables and see what your

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:12.709
