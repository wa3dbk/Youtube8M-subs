and today we're unboxing the cyber
eSports<00:00:11.400> orbiter<00:00:11.910> mouse<00:00:12.120> now<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
eSports orbiter mouse now it's a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.509 
eSports orbiter mouse now it's a
wireless<00:00:13.440> mouse<00:00:13.620> there<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.099> awful<00:00:14.340> lot<00:00:14.429> of

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
wireless mouse there are awful lot of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.099 
wireless mouse there are awful lot of
them<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.700> there<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.360> makes<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.870> long

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
them out there but what makes the long

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.160 
them out there but what makes the long
term<00:00:16.289> our<00:00:16.440> special<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> completely

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
term our special is that it's completely

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.590 
term our special is that it's completely
round<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.789> doesn't<00:00:21.090> matter<00:00:21.210> which<00:00:21.390> way

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
round and it doesn't matter which way

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.910 
round and it doesn't matter which way
you<00:00:21.630> move<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.230> has<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> special<00:00:22.740> digital

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you move it it has a special digital

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
you move it it has a special digital
compass<00:00:23.400> inside<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.480> means<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.019> always

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
compass inside that means it always

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.679 
compass inside that means it always
knows<00:00:25.500> which<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> saying<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
knows which way is up so the saying that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.000 
knows which way is up so the saying that
that<00:00:27.779> makes<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.260> useful<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.980> things

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
that makes it really useful for things

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.690 
that makes it really useful for things
like<00:00:29.330> basic<00:00:30.330> browsing<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.260> also<00:00:31.700> navigation

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
like basic browsing but also navigation

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.959 
like basic browsing but also navigation
through<00:00:33.590> media<00:00:34.590> editing<00:00:34.920> apps<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.730> kind

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
through media editing apps and that kind

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
through media editing apps and that kind
of<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.809> let's<00:00:36.960> open<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
of thing so let's open up and have a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:53.000 
of thing so let's open up and have a
look<00:00:48.020> what<00:00:49.399> opens<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
look what opens up that you can see the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.670 
look what opens up that you can see the
mouse<00:00:53.160> inside<00:00:54.079> let's<00:00:55.079> take<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> look<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.530> see

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
mouse inside let's take a look and see

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.500 
mouse inside let's take a look and see
what's<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.420> have

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
what's on this side first and just have

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.729 
what's on this side first and just have
a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.660> thin<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.320> nothing<00:01:01.440> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a little thin is actually nothing in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:17.350 
a little thin is actually nothing in
there<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.070> everything<00:01:02.340> must<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> side

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.730 

so<00:01:18.360> taking<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.689> plastic<00:01:19.079> section<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so taking this plastic section out but I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.480 
so taking this plastic section out but I
look<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> minute<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:26.149> there's<00:01:27.149> a

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
look about a minute in here there's a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.359 
look about a minute in here there's a
quick<00:01:29.490> start<00:01:29.789> guide<00:01:31.729> minnie<00:01:32.729> driver<00:01:32.909> CD<00:01:34.369> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
quick start guide minnie driver CD and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
quick start guide minnie driver CD and
quick<00:01:35.579> start<00:01:35.819> guide<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.740> is

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
quick start guide there this is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.990 
quick start guide there this is
obviously<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.490> sort<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.700> low<00:01:38.970> friction<00:01:39.299> ring

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.050 

i'm<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> printed<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:45.599> among<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.849> as<00:01:47.849> for<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
i'm a printed use among you as for the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.539 
i'm a printed use among you as for the
mouse<00:01:48.240> itself<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:49.289> open<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:50.390> there's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:52.549> case

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
mouse itself just open up there's a case

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.740 
mouse itself just open up there's a case
based<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.509> it

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.570 

and<00:02:03.650> that's<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.980> neoprene<00:02:04.670> case<00:02:05.470> velcro<00:02:06.580> pull

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
and that's a neoprene case velcro pull

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.980 
and that's a neoprene case velcro pull
it<00:02:07.730> shut<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.660> orbital<00:02:12.140> mouse<00:02:12.290> itself<00:02:13.990> so

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it shut and the orbital mouse itself so

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.520 
it shut and the orbital mouse itself so
that<00:02:15.020> comes<00:02:15.320> with<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.950> charging<00:02:16.910> station<00:02:17.530> as

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that comes with the charging station as

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.220 
that comes with the charging station as
you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:20.300> mouse<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.660> sits<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.050> two

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
you can see the mouse just sits on two

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.090 
you can see the mouse just sits on two
it's<00:02:21.350> got<00:02:23.230> indicator<00:02:24.230> lights<00:02:24.470> there<00:02:24.770> for

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
it's got indicator lights there for

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.760 
it's got indicator lights there for
wireless<00:02:25.490> link<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:25.910> power<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.650> other

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
wireless link and power on the other

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.480 
wireless link and power on the other
side<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.430> USB<00:02:29.180> plug<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:30.020> slotted<00:02:33.340> tape<00:02:34.340> it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
side the USB plug just slotted tape it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:43.960 
side the USB plug just slotted tape it
out<00:02:37.420> that's<00:02:38.420> pretty<00:02:38.600> long<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.820> then<00:02:43.820> there's

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
out that's pretty long and then there's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.430 
out that's pretty long and then there's
the<00:02:44.060> mouse<00:02:44.209> itself<00:02:46.900> now<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.110> kind<00:02:48.410> of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
the mouse itself now this is kind of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.920 
the mouse itself now this is kind of
it's<00:02:48.800> got<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> rubbery<00:02:49.400> kind<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.060> coating<00:02:50.330> on<00:02:50.870> it

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
it's got a rubbery kind of coating on it

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.100 
it's got a rubbery kind of coating on it
like<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.800> skin<00:02:52.270> feels<00:02:53.270> quite<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.780> lot<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
like a skin feels quite a lot like the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.140 
like a skin feels quite a lot like the
silicone<00:02:54.500> coating<00:02:54.860> skins<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:55.850> for

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
silicone coating skins that you get for

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.720 
silicone coating skins that you get for
smartphones<00:02:57.020> like<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> iPhone<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.770> other

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
smartphones like the iPhone on the other

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.470 
smartphones like the iPhone on the other
side<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.180> can<00:02:59.330> see<00:02:59.360> the<00:03:00.850> low<00:03:01.850> friction<00:03:02.060> rings

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
side you can see the low friction rings

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.940 
side you can see the low friction rings
this<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.750> obviously<00:03:02.900> where<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.380> other<00:03:03.470> low

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
this is obviously where the other low

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.560 
this is obviously where the other low
friction<00:03:04.160> ring<00:03:04.489> slots<00:03:04.790> into<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:06.610> laser<00:03:07.610> there

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
friction ring slots into and laser there

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.020 
friction ring slots into and laser there
and<00:03:09.350> as<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.530> can<00:03:09.650> hit<00:03:09.830> probably<00:03:10.160> hear<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
and as you can hit probably hear the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.170 
and as you can hit probably hear the
buttons<00:03:11.510> all<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.720> way<00:03:11.959> around<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.290> sides<00:03:13.180> so

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
buttons all the way around the sides so
