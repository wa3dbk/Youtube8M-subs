00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
here so first off we can check out the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
here so first off we can check out the
design<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> they're

design here you can see that they're

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.299 
design here you can see that they're
very<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.730> identical<00:00:45.300> size<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:46.309> but

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
very very identical size here but

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
very very identical size here but
definitely<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> Moto<00:00:48.539> G<00:00:48.750> definitely<00:00:49.230> feels<00:00:49.410> a

little bit thicker here has a glossy

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
little bit thicker here has a glossy
back<00:00:53.270> farming<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> piece<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> camera<00:00:54.930> only

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
back farming a piece of camera only

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.810 
back farming a piece of camera only
versus<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.770> time<00:00:55.980> piece<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> camera<00:00:56.550> let<00:00:56.699> you

get<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.300> s4<00:00:57.420> mini<00:00:57.600> also<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> hop<00:00:58.859> right

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
get on the s4 mini also the hop right

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
get on the s4 mini also the hop right
sensor<00:00:59.609> thing<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.390> s-1<00:01:00.719> meaning

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
sensor thing here on the s-1 meaning

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
sensor thing here on the s-1 meaning
obviously<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> big<00:01:02.190> things<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.670> the

obviously one of the big things with the
s4<00:01:03.030> meaning<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.080> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
s4 meaning here is going to be that it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
s4 meaning here is going to be that it's
ip67<00:01:04.979> certified<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.820> should<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.240> able<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
ip67 certified so should be able to

handle water pretty well and thus and
also<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> future<00:01:09.960> fingerprint<00:01:10.380> sensor<00:01:10.650> here

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
also that future fingerprint sensor here

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.590 
also that future fingerprint sensor here
