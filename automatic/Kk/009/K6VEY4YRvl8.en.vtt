to help assist with the CC once he's
inside<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.310> base<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:56.090> those<00:03:56.239> are<00:03:56.390> pretty<00:03:56.510> cool

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750

to CC inside the base instead of using a
lighting<00:04:01.820> spell<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.959> can<00:04:03.049> stop<00:04:03.170> having

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
doesn't have much in the base left after

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.410 
doesn't have much in the base left after
that<00:04:48.410> with<00:04:48.650> his<00:04:48.770> queen<00:04:49.010> still<00:04:49.280> alive<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.910> a

that with his queen still alive and a

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.630 
that with his queen still alive and a
lot<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.720> us<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:50.930> lot<00:04:51.350> of<00:04:51.650> hogs<00:04:51.860> left<00:04:52.130> for<00:04:52.310> cleanup

lot of us a lot of hogs left for cleanup

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.210 
lot of us a lot of hogs left for cleanup
so<00:04:53.570> it's<00:04:53.870> honestly<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.320> pretty<00:04:54.560> easy<00:04:54.740> base<00:04:54.950> for

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
so it's honestly a pretty easy base for

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.720 
so it's honestly a pretty easy base for
him<00:04:55.310> here

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
him here

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.570 
him here
great<00:04:56.450> attack<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:57.080> mean<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:58.220> really<00:04:58.430> caused

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
great attack I mean it really caused

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.580 
great attack I mean it really caused
much<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:59.060> threat<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.540> think<00:05:00.230> he<00:05:00.320> ended<00:05:00.500> up

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
much of a threat I think he ended up

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.980 
much of a threat I think he ended up
finishing<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.130> with<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.630> really<00:05:02.630> good<00:05:02.780> amount

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
finishing it with a really good amount

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.300 
finishing it with a really good amount
of<00:05:03.020> time<00:05:03.169> I'll<00:05:03.350> remember<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.710> exact<00:05:04.010> numbers

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
of time I'll remember the exact numbers

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.730 
of time I'll remember the exact numbers
but<00:05:04.490> yeah<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.240> giant<00:05:05.660> also<00:05:06.050> by<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.350> way<00:05:06.500> is

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
but yeah that giant also by the way is

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.159

still<00:05:07.130> going<00:05:07.510> you're<00:05:08.510> gonna<00:05:08.600> eventually<00:05:08.750> see

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
still going you're gonna eventually see

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
it I think it's a couple of seconds here

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.100 
it I think it's a couple of seconds here
it<00:05:10.730> ends<00:05:10.850> up<00:05:10.970> going<00:05:11.150> off<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.480> that<00:05:11.600> spring<00:05:11.870> trap

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
it ends up going off to that spring trap

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.380 
it ends up going off to that spring trap
