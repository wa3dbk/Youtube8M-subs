turn<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.480> steppes<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.020> war<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.300> no<00:00:18.750> idea

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
turn on steppes of war so I have no idea

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
turn on steppes of war so I have no idea
who<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.650> apprentice<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> new

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
who my apprentice and it is the new

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
who my apprentice and it is the new
patch<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.529> letters<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.070> being<00:00:23.279> reset<00:00:23.609> it

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
patch so all letters is being reset it

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
patch so all letters is being reset it
but<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:25.019> already<00:00:25.199> played<00:00:25.590> my<00:00:25.800> five

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
but I have already played my five

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.630 
but I have already played my five
placement<00:00:26.519> matches<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.660> guy<00:00:28.039> it<00:00:29.039> was

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
placement matches and this guy it was

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.470 
placement matches and this guy it was
favored<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> let's<00:00:32.520> assume<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.360> an

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
favored so let's assume is just an

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.729 
favored so let's assume is just an
average<00:00:33.809> Terran<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.960> let's<00:00:36.960> check<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.530> we

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
average Terran and let's check what we

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.660 
average Terran and let's check what we
are<00:00:38.100> doing<00:00:38.610> versus<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.829> once<00:00:41.520> again

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
are doing versus that so once again

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.779 
are doing versus that so once again
we're<00:00:42.000> doing<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> double<00:00:42.870> extractor<00:00:43.469> trick

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
we're doing the double extractor trick

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.979 
we're doing the double extractor trick
at<00:00:45.020> approximately<00:00:46.520> 125<00:00:47.520> minerals<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:50.309> 12

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
at approximately 125 minerals to 12

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
at approximately 125 minerals to 12
exactly<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.350> drones<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.610> careful

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
exactly two drones and then careful

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.340 
exactly two drones and then careful
careful<00:00:58.219> okay<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.109> drown

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
careful okay so when we have to drown

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.240 
careful okay so when we have to drown
and<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:02.430> 100<00:01:02.699> minerals<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.470> oversee

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and like 100 minerals they can oversee

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.179 
and like 100 minerals they can oversee
your<00:01:05.369> Overlord<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:09.170> I'm<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.350> sending<00:01:10.590> this

helium<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:21.960> they<00:05:22.860> are<00:05:22.919> useless<00:05:24.590> well<00:05:25.590> not

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
helium and they are useless well not

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.840 
helium and they are useless well not
very<00:05:26.340> interesting<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.360> something<00:05:28.050> will
