00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.530
 I hope he does not get with it 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.750
 the original photographer's car and well I think we're inside 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.669
 for that 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.049
 it is now 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.140
 the enemy 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.739
 the aerodynamics 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.909
 of speed 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.909
 next the treatment that has had ground 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.999
 you have to face the large air currents that produce 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.310
 turbulence the part 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.590
 for this the expo 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 pulling 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 a greater frontal affection 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.800
 the airline action 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.000
 a gas treatment also matters 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.030
 penetrate through this place 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.020
 after cooling 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.210
 the radiator 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.030
 when you obviously work with liquids 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.070
 the motor 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 have a fatigue for this place and when blowing the hot air 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.379
 variation 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.010
 of volume as a consequence of the variation 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.260
 Of temperature 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.910
 it's about avoiding the head-on collision 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.870
 against the windshield that is definitely one of the elements most slows down 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.020
 that has car healing when it comes to treating this 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.600
 at high speed 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.000
 almost the entire province has been covered 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 with the treatment if we observe the other vehicle 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.499
 in the lateral propagation of the tube what usually costs 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.520
 the fender 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.170
 car interest 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.420
 has already 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 installed the engine the engine is a child 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.540
 oo point 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.120
 this afternoon low he told us oreste berta did so much as a scam 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.320
 elaborated 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 an important power to boost 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.910
 internally 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.230
 the compact practically what corresponds race car 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.650
 As such, respect 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.920
 this one started 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.950
 therefore we observe 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.800
 1 tenzin metro 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.460
 to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.830
 permanently check or permanently control carburetion 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.149
 and to the right the usual the pressure gives me 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.329
 some temperature values 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 and presses oil as well as the average temperature 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.459
 next the compact of the gearbox here unlike what 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.309
 comes added 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.789
 it's about the place to be here of theatrical art 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.429
 because the engine here 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.429
 what is said verbatim central for what is worth 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.579
 between them 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.439
 the rear axle and bp reinforce a lot of this 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.759
 here it must be 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.219
 place an engine 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.199
 because the power exceeds 200 horsepower 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.349
 the technique indicates 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.919
 than to achieve good traction 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.079
 the front should not have more mud capacity 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.870
 130 to 150 horses in this this average of almost to zero regulations and 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.049
 I could 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.969
 the author would be like this 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.689
 with the astra engine 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.689
 is so that when it comes to speeding up in the loading transaction 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.969
 sufficient strength enough dementia to transmit the power 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.339
 and get 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.379
 speed 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.379
 aerodynamically this is completed 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.109
 I want to highlight these pickets that has no aerodynamic profile 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.929
 it's practically minimal 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.829
 what you like the aerodynamic profile 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.319
 here what else you try to get 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.099
 p the separation of the upper air stream with the lower one 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.369
 under the floor to avoid curule mattresses 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.189
 in this way 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.589
 the somewhat dynamic coefficient I wanted insights 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.869
 studies that grew a car's coffers 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.699
 I will cite real project 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.729
 what may be the pride of that text
