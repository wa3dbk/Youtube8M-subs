I think my therapist is kind of an idiot
maybe<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.110> should<00:02:00.260> just<00:02:00.410> have<00:02:00.470> gurus<00:02:01.420> find<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
maybe I should just have gurus find a

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.250 
maybe I should just have gurus find a
nutritionist<00:02:04.810> what<00:02:05.810> I'm<00:02:05.900> doing<00:02:06.110> now<00:02:06.229> that

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
nutritionist what I'm doing now that
