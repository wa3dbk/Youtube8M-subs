00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
gloss white it works pretty well it's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.969 
gloss white it works pretty well it's
really<00:01:43.890> fine<00:01:44.160> mist<00:01:44.550> spray<00:01:45.510> pretty<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.260> was

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
really fine mist spray pretty well I was

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.290

very<00:01:48.750> fast

I<00:01:50.510> believe<00:01:51.510> my<00:01:51.600> local<00:01:51.810> hobby<00:01:52.050> shop<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.500> be

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I believe my local hobby shop will be

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
I believe my local hobby shop will be
using<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.490> instead<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> Patras

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
using this from now on instead of Patras

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.930 
using this from now on instead of Patras
so<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.290> guess<00:01:55.890> I'll<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.190> have<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.400> get<00:01:56.610> used<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
so I guess I'll just have to get used to

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.980 
so I guess I'll just have to get used to
it<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.240> start<00:01:57.450> ordering<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:57.930> pendulum<00:01:58.260> line

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
it or start ordering my pendulum line

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
it or start ordering my pendulum line
you<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.140> went<00:02:01.350> together<00:02:01.830> pretty<00:02:02.070> well<00:02:02.369> far

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you get went together pretty well far

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.790 
you get went together pretty well far

this<00:04:27.650> black<00:04:27.920> stripe<00:04:28.250> on<00:04:28.430> there<00:04:28.640> which<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.970> still

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
this black stripe on there which I still

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.910 
this black stripe on there which I still
question<00:04:29.690> but<00:04:30.020> it's<00:04:30.170> a<00:04:30.230> little<00:04:30.380> too<00:04:30.620> late<00:04:30.770> to

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
question but it's a little too late to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.090 
question but it's a little too late to
question<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.430> now<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.870> as<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.320> said<00:04:33.710> keep<00:04:33.920> it

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
question it now but as I said keep it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.720 
question it now but as I said keep it
fairly<00:04:34.280> simple<00:04:34.990> it's<00:04:35.990> pretty<00:04:36.920> waterproof<00:04:37.430> I

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
fairly simple it's pretty waterproof I

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.490 
fairly simple it's pretty waterproof I
feel<00:04:38.000> pretty<00:04:38.180> confident<00:04:38.660> in<00:04:38.810> submerging<00:04:39.350> this

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500

and fairly hot water
I<00:04:41.210> don't<00:04:41.480> like<00:04:41.630> submerging<00:04:42.440> my<00:04:42.530> light<00:04:42.710> pose

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
I don't like submerging my light pose

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.670 
I don't like submerging my light pose
unless<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.030> bagged<00:04:44.390> them<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.290> don't<00:04:45.500> bag

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
unless I bagged them and I don't bag

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.020 
unless I bagged them and I don't bag
them<00:04:45.920> much<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:47.350> we<00:04:48.350> get<00:04:48.590> her<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.740> lot<00:04:49.520> waist<00:04:49.760> high

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
them much so we get her a lot waist high

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.450 
them much so we get her a lot waist high
in<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.360> water<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.900> she<00:04:51.650> does<00:04:51.800> pretty<00:04:52.040> pretty

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
in the water and she does pretty pretty

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.540 
in the water and she does pretty pretty
well<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:53.470> better<00:04:54.470> turn<00:04:54.710> this<00:04:54.890> off<00:04:55.130> before<00:04:55.520> my

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
well I better turn this off before my

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.530 
well I better turn this off before my
dog<00:04:55.880> starts<00:04:56.390> going<00:04:56.690> crazy<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:02.000> still<00:05:02.330> pretty

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
early I haven't put it through too much

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.240 
early I haven't put it through too much
just<00:05:05.570> still<00:05:05.810> getting<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.110> fine-tuning<00:05:06.680> right

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
just still getting the fine-tuning right

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.280 
just still getting the fine-tuning right
down<00:05:07.550> getting<00:05:07.850> all<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.060> kinks<00:05:08.390> worked<00:05:08.420> out<00:05:08.840> on

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
suspension as well it's pretty good it

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.730 
suspension as well it's pretty good it
rolls<00:05:12.560> pretty<00:05:13.460> well<00:05:13.730> as<00:05:13.880> 30-weight<00:05:14.530> axial<00:05:15.530> oil

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740
