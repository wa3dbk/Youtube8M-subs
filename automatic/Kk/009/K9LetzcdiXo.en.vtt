that we are messing around with all
these<00:00:19.080> advanced<00:00:19.560> settings<00:00:20.400> okay<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> yeah

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
these advanced settings okay so yeah

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.070 
these advanced settings okay so yeah
yes<00:00:24.510> let's<00:00:24.869> say<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.510> what<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.689> did<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
yes let's say I have and what it did it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.339 
yes let's say I have and what it did it
tell<00:00:28.560> me<00:00:28.740> done<00:00:29.039> adding<00:00:29.490> new<00:00:29.640> advanced<00:00:30.210> XML<00:00:30.929> so

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
tell me done adding new advanced XML so

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
tell me done adding new advanced XML so
here<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> does<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.759> created<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
here is what it does it created the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.290 
here is what it does it created the
advanced<00:00:33.870> settings<00:00:34.469> taught<00:00:34.710> XML<00:00:35.219> file<00:00:35.489> with

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
advanced settings taught XML file with

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.930 
advanced settings taught XML file with
these<00:00:36.809> tricks<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.920> settings<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.700> see

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
these tricks these settings you see

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.560 
these tricks these settings you see
which<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.790> modify<00:00:41.790> yourself

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
which you can go and modify yourself

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
which you can go and modify yourself
with<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.020> over<00:00:43.469> here<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:45.210> what

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
with this over here so there that's what

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.610 
with this over here so there that's what
it<00:00:45.690> does<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.680> what's<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.620> let

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it does what so what's that this is let

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.729 
it does what so what's that this is let
me<00:00:49.649> show<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.149> okay<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.469> when

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
me show you what this is okay and when

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.520 
me show you what this is okay and when
you<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> enable<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.899> change

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you have it enable when we do change

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.880 
you have it enable when we do change
first<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> good<00:00:57.840> idea<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> exit

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
first of all it's a good idea to exit

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.209 
first of all it's a good idea to exit
and<00:00:59.100> restart<00:00:59.309> coding<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.070> I'm

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and restart coding so that's what I'm

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.850 
and restart coding so that's what I'm
going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:04.379> let<00:01:04.650> me<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
going to do right now and let me just

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.660 
going to do right now and let me just
show<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:07.400> zero<00:01:08.400> cash

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
show you what that is the zero cash

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.859 
show you what that is the zero cash
let's<00:01:09.090> say<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:11.060> see<00:01:12.060> something<00:01:12.630> from

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
let's say I want to see something from

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.700 
let's say I want to see something from

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
atom so let's try and find an episode

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.609 
atom so let's try and find an episode
that<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.380> watch<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.180> Grey's<00:01:24.180> Anatomy

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
that we want to watch and Grey's Anatomy

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.140 
that we want to watch and Grey's Anatomy
okay<00:01:25.619> let's<00:01:25.860> try<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.189> watch<00:01:26.400> Grey's<00:01:26.909> Anatomy

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
okay let's try and watch Grey's Anatomy

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.740 
okay let's try and watch Grey's Anatomy
and<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> creates<00:01:28.380> Anatomy<00:01:28.860> episode<00:01:28.979> over<00:01:29.790> here

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.770 

and<00:01:33.410> let's<00:01:33.980> select<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:36.880> HD<00:01:37.880> source<00:01:38.920> 1080p

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
and let's select this HD source 1080p

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.240 
and let's select this HD source 1080p
and<00:01:41.780> as<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.200> see<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.620> it's<00:01:42.800> buffering

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and as you can see here it's buffering

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.090 
and as you can see here it's buffering
right<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:45.760> sometimes<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.960> notice<00:01:48.680> that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
right and sometimes you notice that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.860 
right and sometimes you notice that
while<00:01:49.550> it's<00:01:49.790> buffering<00:01:50.150> tells<00:01:50.570> me<00:01:50.720> that

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
while it's buffering tells me that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.770 
while it's buffering tells me that
buffer<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.100> full<00:01:52.540> cache<00:01:53.590> storage<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:55.250> full

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
buffer is full cache storage is full

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.090 
buffer is full cache storage is full
right<00:01:56.780> now<00:01:57.050> when<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.440> pose<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.280> is<00:01:58.580> still

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
right now when I pose this is still

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.840 
right now when I pose this is still
downloading<00:02:01.100> still<00:02:02.060> buffering<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:03.200> see<00:02:03.850> what

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
downloading still buffering you see what

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.530 
downloading still buffering you see what
it<00:02:05.000> did<00:02:05.210> what<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.140> setting<00:02:06.680> did<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.220> make<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
it did what that setting did is make the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.699 
it did what that setting did is make the
buffer<00:02:09.020> even<00:02:09.950> larger<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:11.240> infinitely<00:02:12.140> larger

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
buffer even larger for infinitely larger

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.060 
buffer even larger for infinitely larger
so<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.580> pause<00:02:13.850> here<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.800> things<00:02:15.800> will

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
so you can pause here and things will

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.260 
so you can pause here and things will
keep<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.000> buffering<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.560> background<00:02:19.270> and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
keep on buffering on the background and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.690 
keep on buffering on the background and
it<00:02:20.840> will<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:22.580> will<00:02:22.790> never<00:02:23.060> stop<00:02:24.340> laughing<00:02:25.340> you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it will it will never stop laughing you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.560 
it will it will never stop laughing you
see<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.480> part<00:02:26.780> here<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.800> what<00:02:28.070> we<00:02:28.850> where

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
see this part here this is what we where

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.160 
see this part here this is what we where
we<00:02:29.780> are<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.740> what<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.130> buffering

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
we are and this is what is buffering

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.050 
we are and this is what is buffering
previously<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.440> was<00:02:33.650> only<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:34.040> small<00:02:34.550> amount

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
previously there was only a small amount

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.690 
previously there was only a small amount
of<00:02:35.600> memory<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.470> buffering<00:02:36.860> but<00:02:37.250> right<00:02:37.489> now

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
of memory for buffering but right now

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.990 
of memory for buffering but right now
you<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:38.239> see<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.540> madam<00:02:38.840> post<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.500> this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you can see the madam post and this

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.290 
you can see the madam post and this
continues<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.450> will<00:02:41.720> continue<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.590> buffer

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
continues and it will continue to buffer

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.360 
continues and it will continue to buffer
that<00:02:44.300> means<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:44.989> using<00:02:45.440> your<00:02:45.860> storage

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
that means it's using your storage

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.199 
that means it's using your storage
device<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:47.330> buffer<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:49.459> will<00:02:49.670> keep<00:02:50.030> on

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
device to buffer and it will keep on

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.490 
device to buffer and it will keep on
buffering<00:02:51.100> until<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.280> end<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.870> 42

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
buffering until the end of this 42

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.979 
buffering until the end of this 42
minutes<00:02:54.709> over<00:02:55.459> here<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.850> see<00:02:56.060> if<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.750> have

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
minutes over here you see if you have

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.500 
minutes over here you see if you have
buffering<00:02:57.769> issues<00:02:58.250> if<00:02:58.550> your<00:02:58.850> connection<00:02:59.390> is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
buffering issues if your connection is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.320 
buffering issues if your connection is
slow<00:02:59.630> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.470> one<00:03:00.890> way<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.640> avoid<00:03:01.880> all<00:03:02.120> those

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
slow this is one way to avoid all those

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.320 
slow this is one way to avoid all those
poses<00:03:02.840> all<00:03:03.230> those<00:03:03.940> buffering<00:03:04.940> yeah<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.150> know

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
poses all those buffering yeah you know

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.660 
poses all those buffering yeah you know
the<00:03:05.510> thing<00:03:06.230> freezes<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.860> then<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.160> buffers

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
the thing freezes and then it buffers

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.710 
the thing freezes and then it buffers
and<00:03:08.320> two<00:03:09.320> seconds<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.890> buffers<00:03:10.310> again<00:03:10.720> with

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
and two seconds it buffers again with

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.690 
and two seconds it buffers again with
this<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.080> can<00:03:12.320> press<00:03:12.500> pause<00:03:12.799> go<00:03:13.130> for<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> coffee

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
this you can press pause go for a coffee

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.120 
this you can press pause go for a coffee
come<00:03:14.150> back<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.600> watch<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.989> whole<00:03:15.170> thing<00:03:15.200> in

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
come back and watch the whole thing in

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.060 
come back and watch the whole thing in
one<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.420> while<00:03:17.720> I'm<00:03:17.959> speaking<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.590> can<00:03:18.830> see

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
one so while I'm speaking you can see

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.449 
one so while I'm speaking you can see
that<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.700> streaming<00:03:20.180> over<00:03:20.630> here<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.400> got<00:03:22.400> a

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
that it's streaming over here and got a

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.350 
that it's streaming over here and got a
big<00:03:22.910> chunk<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.660> my<00:03:24.440> chances<00:03:25.070> are<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.519> when<00:03:26.330> I

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
big chunk so my chances are that when I

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.860 
big chunk so my chances are that when I
start<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.200> play<00:03:27.470> this<00:03:27.700> these<00:03:28.700> will<00:03:29.030> stay<00:03:29.540> on

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
start to play this these will stay on

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.460 
start to play this these will stay on
top<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.890> will<00:03:31.190> go<00:03:31.580> on<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.360> will<00:03:32.470> watch

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
top and it will go on and I will watch

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.699 
top and it will go on and I will watch
my<00:03:33.890> whole<00:03:34.100> thing<00:03:34.430> without<00:03:34.850> any<00:03:35.120> buffering

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709
