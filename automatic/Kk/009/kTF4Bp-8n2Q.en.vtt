00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.730
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Nicole Smith: Today we\'92re
at the McNamara Alumni Center for the most

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.970
exciting day of the year, this is Match Day.
Seriously this is more exciting then graduation.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.970
 \
\

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.150
Mike Parrott: Match Day is this day where
all the medical students across the United

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.359
States find out where they\'92re matching
in their respective residency programs. \

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.730
\
Dave Danielson: Medical schools all over the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.300
country do this roughly all at the same time,
so everyone is kind of finding out at the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.570
same time where they\'92re going to be. \
\

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.660
Nicole: This is where you pick your specialty,
what kind of doctor you\'92re going to be,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.960
and where you\'92re going to train.\
\

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.719
Mike: Students will rank up to 20-30 schools
or programs that they want to go to for further

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.190
training in their specialty of choice, it\'92s
kind of like on the job training. \

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.489
\
Nicole: Pretty much everyone gets in, but

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.570
the question is where and in what field.\
\

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.579
Mike: For me that\'92s family medicine and
in my case I only rank programs with in the

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.520
state of Minnesota, specifically that are
operated by the university.\

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.440
\
Dave: As I went along in my training, I found

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.770
that I really enjoyed the variety; I enjoyed
also being, especially in a small town being

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.280
such an integral part of patient care.\
\

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.300
Mike: I think of my self as a generalist and
some sort of a support character in this whole

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.280
health care team that allows me to continue
to work in a number of different areas with

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.140
a number of different people on a number of
different problems, and continue to be flexible

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.830
to meet the needs that my patients may have.
And I think that\'92s why family medicine

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.480
fits with me very well.
You know everybody here knows they have a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.970
job somewhere, the trick is just figuring
out where and what those opportunities will

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.270
be given the place they are matching. \
\

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.741
Dave: It\'92s kind of a weird experience o
just find out where you\'92re going to move

00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:58.800
from an envelope. EXCELLENT! It went great
I ended up getting my number one spot, so

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.300
I am really excited. It\'92s nice to know
what I\'92m going to be doing next year. \

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
\
Nicole: For me my husband has been in Afghanistan

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.080
for almost a year and I am crossing my fingers
that, that cell phone is going to ring so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:22.409
we can share that moment because its one of
the biggest ones of my life. You made it in

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.720
time, you made it in time. We are going to
St. Josephs in St. Paul.\

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.950
\
Mike: Smiley\'92s, I matched with Smiley\'92s

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.990
which was number one on my list. Smiley\'92s
is the family medicine program that the university

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.959
operates here at the Fairview Hospital System.
I am, I\'92m very happy.\

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.599
\
Nicole: Moving on, moving on to the next phase

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.769
in life. I kind of have to spend the next
few months getting use to someone calling

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:43.239
me doctor. \
