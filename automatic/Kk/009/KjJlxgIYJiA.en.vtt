the<00:00:09.420> gas<00:00:09.599> tank<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.139> built<00:00:10.410> into<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.920> frame<00:00:11.389> but

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the gas tank is built into the frame but

the gas tank is built into the frame but
you<00:00:12.420> guys<00:00:12.660> know<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:15.920> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.850> our<00:00:18.000> battery

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
you guys know and this is our battery
