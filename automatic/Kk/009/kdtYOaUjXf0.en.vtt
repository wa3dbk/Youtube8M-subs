there's the normal sand so i will show
you<00:00:36.809> how<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.230> create<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:38.969> normal

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
you how to create them you make normal

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.799 
you how to create them you make normal
sandstone<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> take

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sandstone like that and then you take

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
sandstone like that and then you take
that<00:00:43.110> put<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.920> another<00:00:44.040> four<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.120> get

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that put it in another four you get

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.279 
that put it in another four you get
smooth<00:00:45.629> sandstone<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.309> either<00:00:47.489> use

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
smooth sandstone now you can either use

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
smooth sandstone now you can either use
smooth<00:00:49.289> sandstone<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.399> normal

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
smooth sandstone to make normal

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.900 
smooth sandstone to make normal
sandstone<00:00:51.600> slabs<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.070> still<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
sandstone slabs or you can still use the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.830 
sandstone slabs or you can still use the
sand<00:00:54.539> stone<00:00:54.809> bricks<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.510> other

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
sand stone bricks like that or the other

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.670 
sand stone bricks like that or the other
kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> sandstone<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
kind of sandstone and to make the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
kind of sandstone and to make the
creeper<00:01:02.190> sandstone<00:01:03.080> that's<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.379> I'm

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
creeper sandstone that's just what I'm

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.450 
creeper sandstone that's just what I'm
going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> call<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.250> stack<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:06.229> half

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
going to call it you stack to half

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.740 
going to call it you stack to half
sandstone<00:01:08.460> half<00:01:08.729> blocks<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.270> top<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.600> each

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
sandstone half blocks on top of each

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.250 
sandstone half blocks on top of each
other<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> creeper<00:01:12.260> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
other and you get the creeper the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.580 
other and you get the creeper the
creeper<00:01:13.770> sandstone<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
creeper sandstone so see all right and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.999 
creeper sandstone so see all right and
so<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> wood<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.619> top

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so for the wood as you can see the top

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.330 
so for the wood as you can see the top
or<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.700> bottom<00:01:20.729> correlates<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> top<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
or the bottom correlates with the top so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.830 
or the bottom correlates with the top so
normal<00:01:24.299> wood<00:01:24.450> gives<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> normal<00:01:25.460> dark<00:01:26.840> dark

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
normal wood gives you normal dark dark

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
normal wood gives you normal dark dark
wood<00:01:28.220> there<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
wood there it's it's more of like the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.890 
wood there it's it's more of like the
forest<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.549> normal<00:01:33.000> forest<00:01:33.509> birch

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
forest so we have normal forest birch

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530 
forest so we have normal forest birch
and<00:01:34.170> jungle<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.880> gives<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> dark

and they look very cool so I'll just

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
and they look very cool so I'll just
kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> double<00:01:56.820> stack<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
kind of do a double stack right here a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.709 
kind of do a double stack right here a
cube<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> cube<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
cube not a cube but like this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.499 
cube not a cube but like this
see<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> see<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.679> they<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.270> all

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
see you can see that they that they all

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.630 
see you can see that they that they all
look<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.869> same<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.280> flow

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
look the same they would they will flow

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.390 
look the same they would they will flow
nicely<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.840> they're<00:02:10.470> still<00:02:10.709> rather

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
nicely but they're still rather

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640 
nicely but they're still rather
different<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:12.989> for<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.410> new

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
different so that is it for the new

have noticed or something that was also
added<00:02:24.150> was<00:02:24.330> when<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.629> press<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.110> f3<00:02:25.290> button

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
added was when you press the f3 button

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.600 
added was when you press the f3 button
it<00:02:27.090> no<00:02:27.360> longer<00:02:27.599> drops<00:02:28.200> your<00:02:28.440> FPS<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.129> uses<00:02:29.489> a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
it no longer drops your FPS and uses a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.520 
it no longer drops your FPS and uses a
heck<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.209> lot<00:02:30.239> more<00:02:31.099> memory<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.280> stuff<00:02:32.519> like

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
heck of a lot more memory and stuff like

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.110 
heck of a lot more memory and stuff like
when<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> usually<00:02:35.099> when<00:02:35.250> i<00:02:35.280> press<00:02:35.579> this<00:02:35.760> i<00:02:35.970> would

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
when I usually when i press this i would

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.449 
when I usually when i press this i would
be<00:02:36.239> maybe<00:02:36.480> twenty<00:02:36.900> percent<00:02:37.230> 20<00:02:37.680> FPS<00:02:37.829> right<00:02:38.340> now

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
be maybe twenty percent 20 FPS right now

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.120 
be maybe twenty percent 20 FPS right now
i'm<00:02:38.579> at<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> flat<00:02:39.239> 30<00:02:39.660> because<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:40.680> completely

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
i'm at a flat 30 because it's completely

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.949 
i'm at a flat 30 because it's completely
flat<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> yeah<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.790> doing<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.569> no<00:02:45.780> longer

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
flat and so yeah it doing this no longer

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.250 
flat and so yeah it doing this no longer
drops<00:02:46.380> your<00:02:46.590> FPS<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> that's<00:02:48.599> good<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.870> then

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
drops your FPS so that's good and then

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
drops your FPS so that's good and then
the<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.440> thing<00:02:49.680> was<00:02:50.190> cats<00:02:50.700> now<00:02:51.060> behave
