00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
suffered some damage there was also

pieces with flying web page flew back

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.130 
pieces with flying web page flew back
and<00:00:41.610> probably<00:00:41.969> damaged<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.750> tail<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> the

and probably damaged the tail of the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.910 
and probably damaged the tail of the
United<00:00:43.530> aircraft<00:00:44.270> without<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> tail<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.289> TWA

United aircraft without a tail the TWA

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
United aircraft without a tail the TWA
aircraft<00:00:47.399> basically<00:00:48.000> went<00:00:48.180> straight<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.480> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
aircraft basically went straight down in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
aircraft basically went straight down in
fact<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> ended<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.920> crashing<00:00:50.370> inverted<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fact it ended up crashing inverted it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.990 
fact it ended up crashing inverted it
was<00:00:51.059> slightly<00:00:51.300> upside<00:00:51.719> down<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> United

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
was slightly upside down the United

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180 
was slightly upside down the United
plane<00:00:54.239> had<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.750> control<00:00:54.960> ability<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
plane had some control ability but not a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000 
plane had some control ability but not a
lot<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.170> its<00:00:58.289> wing<00:00:58.469> missing<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
lot that much of its wing missing and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.439 
lot that much of its wing missing and
probably<00:00:59.309> those<00:00:59.520> engines<00:00:59.850> damaged<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.420> well

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
probably those engines damaged as well

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.240 
probably those engines damaged as well
that<00:01:00.750> would<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.960> lost<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:02.030> lift<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
that would have lost a lot of lift and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
that would have lost a lot of lift and
thrust<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.790> wing<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
thrust off that wing so that way when it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.060 
thrust off that wing so that way when it
on<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.320> basically<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> gone

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
on down it basically would have gone

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.600 
on down it basically would have gone
into<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.700> violent<00:01:09.560> bank<00:01:10.560> possibly<00:01:11.130> even<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.400> roll

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
into a violent bank possibly even a roll

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.350 
into a violent bank possibly even a roll

they were go back and play that and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.870 
they were go back and play that and
analyze<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> same<00:01:25.770> team<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.189> experts

reporters from the Apollo 1 fire were

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.680 
reporters from the Apollo 1 fire were
able<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.780> determine<00:01:31.900> there<00:01:32.560> were<00:01:32.680> two<00:01:32.860> voices

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
able to determine there were two voices

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.050 
able to determine there were two voices
on<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.930> recording<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.740> one<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.190> them<00:01:37.140> the

on that recording and one of them the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.010 
on that recording and one of them the
copilot<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:42.340> was<00:01:42.700> probably<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.600> captain

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
copilot and one was probably the captain

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.420 
copilot and one was probably the captain
on<00:01:44.530> board<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:45.040> aircraft<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.890> main

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
on board that aircraft and the main

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.200 
on board that aircraft and the main
voice<00:01:48.700> was<00:01:49.000> able<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.450> use<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:50.550> Salt<00:01:51.550> Lake<00:01:51.730> United

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
voice was able to use a Salt Lake United

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.170 
voice was able to use a Salt Lake United
718<00:01:52.890> we're<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.580> we're<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:54.970> down

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
718 we're going in and we're going down

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.570 
718 we're going in and we're going down
and<00:01:55.540> in<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> background<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.680> could<00:01:56.860> hear<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
and in the background you could hear the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.210 
and in the background you could hear the
other<00:01:58.150> person<00:01:58.270> yelling<00:01:59.140> something<00:01:59.980> was

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
other person yelling something was

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.070 
other person yelling something was
probably<00:02:00.670> pull<00:02:01.000> out<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.360> pull<00:02:01.510> out<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:01.960> they

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
probably pull out and pull out so they

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.560 
probably pull out and pull out so they
were<00:02:02.200> still<00:02:02.410> trying<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.680> fly<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:02.980> aircraft

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
were still trying to fly that aircraft

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.220 
were still trying to fly that aircraft
right<00:02:04.570> after<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.930> last<00:02:05.080> second<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.869> just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
right after the last second that's just

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.620 
right after the last second that's just
about<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.470> end<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.920> my<00:02:12.430> segment<00:02:13.210> here<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.390> just

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
about the end of my segment here I just

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.210 
about the end of my segment here I just
wanted<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.990> thank<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.410> few<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.830> folks<00:02:15.070> that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
wanted to thank a few of the folks that
