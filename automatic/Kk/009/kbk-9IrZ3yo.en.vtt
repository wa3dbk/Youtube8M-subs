00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
slightly different class setup than

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.510 
slightly different class setup than
others<00:00:31.230> due<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> fact<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.399> actually

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
others due to the fact that you actually

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
others due to the fact that you actually
need<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> focus<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.480> something<00:00:33.780> very

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
need to focus on something very

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.250 
need to focus on something very
importantly<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.760> speed<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> am

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
importantly which is the speed now I am

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
importantly which is the speed now I am
pretty<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> shotgun<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.670> that's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
pretty good at the shotgun and that's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
pretty good at the shotgun and that's
because<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> first<00:00:39.750> game<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.020> ever<00:00:40.170> played<00:00:40.379> was

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
because the first game i ever played was

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
because the first game i ever played was
pretty<00:00:41.340> much<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> shotgun<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.090> game<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.420> i'll

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
pretty much a shotgun in game which i'll

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
pretty much a shotgun in game which i'll
explain<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.079> another<00:00:43.110> video<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.190> basically

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this class setup is gonna be merely for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.849 
this class setup is gonna be merely for
tips<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.660> good<00:00:57.870> idea<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.500> costs

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
tips and a good idea as to what costs

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319

that<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> build<00:00:59.520> rather<00:01:00.059> than<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that you want to build rather than a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
that you want to build rather than a
newbie<00:01:00.750> video<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.289> obviously<00:01:01.440> some

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
newbie video because obviously some

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
newbie video because obviously some
people<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.460> shotguns<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.629> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
people do not like shotguns but they are

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
people do not like shotguns but they are
overpowered<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.250> need<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.729> use

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
overpowered and you do need to make use

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
overpowered and you do need to make use
of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.330> high<00:01:06.479> damage<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
of the high damage that they have so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.590 
of the high damage that they have so
hopefully<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> class<00:01:08.520> setup<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.090> be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
hopefully the class setup that will be

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.640 
hopefully the class setup that will be
offering<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.979> best<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.320> ok<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.380> now

let's take a look at the perks ok so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.140 
let's take a look at the perks ok so
what<00:01:34.470> you'd<00:01:34.619> probably<00:01:34.890> notice<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> layout

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
what you'd probably notice by the layout

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.429 
what you'd probably notice by the layout
of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> perks<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.380> like

of the perks is that it's very much like
legally<00:01:38.159> class<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:39.090> my<00:01:39.240> opinion<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.930> is
