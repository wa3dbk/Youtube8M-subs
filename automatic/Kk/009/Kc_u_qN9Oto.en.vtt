00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.580 
Assessors is survival I think that
wouldn't<00:01:39.689> hurt<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> much<00:01:40.110> injustice<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
wouldn't hurt that much injustice that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.040 
wouldn't hurt that much injustice that
they<00:01:41.070> occasionally

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
they occasionally

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.700 
they occasionally
I<00:01:42.080> think<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> second<00:01:42.800> one<00:01:47.320> when<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.410> go<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.590> an

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
I think the second one when you go to an

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.530 
I think the second one when you go to an
assessment<00:01:49.160> center<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:49.790> about<00:01:50.060> how<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.210> mix

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
assessment center it's about how you mix

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.790 
assessment center it's about how you mix
with<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.810> people<00:01:51.230> it's<00:01:51.380> about<00:01:51.590> how<00:01:51.770> you

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
with the people it's about how you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.280 
with the people it's about how you
present<00:01:52.460> yourself<00:01:52.760> it<00:01:53.540> takes<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.930> beyond

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
present yourself it takes you beyond

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.070 
present yourself it takes you beyond
academics<00:01:55.040> into<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.880> personality<00:01:56.570> and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
academics into the personality and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.290 
academics into the personality and
without<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.890> think<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.250> become<00:01:58.580> less

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
without that I think you become less

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.870 
without that I think you become less

behind<00:02:07.730> recruitment<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.630> development<00:02:09.170> I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
behind recruitment and development I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.920 
behind recruitment and development I
mean<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> very<00:02:11.300> different<00:02:11.600> way<00:02:11.900> of

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
mean that is a very different way of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.480 
mean that is a very different way of
recruiting<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.560> something<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.280> lot<00:02:13.310> of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
recruiting and something that a lot of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.980 
recruiting and something that a lot of
people<00:02:13.580> are<00:02:13.850> doing<00:02:13.910> these<00:02:14.120> days<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.630> that's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
people are doing these days and that's

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.750 
people are doing these days and that's
something<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.560> think<00:02:15.740> muncaster<00:02:16.190> has<00:02:16.490> as

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
something that I think muncaster has as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.640 
something that I think muncaster has as
a<00:02:17.330> competitive<00:02:17.810> edge<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.530> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
a competitive edge here because it is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.150 
a competitive edge here because it is
giving<00:02:18.980> their<00:02:19.100> students<00:02:19.490> that<00:02:20.090> additional

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
giving their students that additional

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.930 
giving their students that additional
information<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.190> additional<00:02:22.610> insight

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
information that additional insight

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.390 
information that additional insight
additional<00:02:23.600> skills<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.020> knowledge<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:25.160> just
