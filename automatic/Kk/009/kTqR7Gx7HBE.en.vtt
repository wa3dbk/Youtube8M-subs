00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
all rivets is you would make your holes

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.819 
all rivets is you would make your holes
first<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.780> hole<00:00:37.020> punch<00:00:37.050> die<00:00:37.530> right

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
first so I have my hole punch die right

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.459 
first so I have my hole punch die right
here<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> put<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the bottom die and then into the machine

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.330 
the bottom die and then into the machine
and<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.579> had<00:00:53.879> questions<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:55.309> how<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and I've had questions about how to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.080 
and I've had questions about how to
evenly<00:00:57.239> spaced<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.320> rivets<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.850> look

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
evenly spaced the rivets so they look

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.470 
evenly spaced the rivets so they look
equal<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.670> great<00:01:02.820> tip<00:01:03.149> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
equal and I have a really great tip for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.670 
equal and I have a really great tip for
that<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:04.470> either<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.960> peel

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that now either you can get these peel

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
that now either you can get these peel
and<00:01:07.950> stick<00:01:09.860> tape<00:01:10.860> measures<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.630> local

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and stick tape measures at your local

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.490 
and stick tape measures at your local
craft<00:01:13.320> stores<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.790> made<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.869> really

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
craft stores or I made a really

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.429 
craft stores or I made a really
fantastic<00:01:18.259> grid<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.640> cardboard<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.659> as

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
fantastic grid out of cardboard and as

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
fantastic grid out of cardboard and as
you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.250> bottom<00:01:23.549> part<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> grid

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you can see the bottom part is the grid

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
you can see the bottom part is the grid
and<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:24.960> fold<00:01:25.259> over<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.159> can

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and it would fold over and you can

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
and it would fold over and you can
easily<00:01:26.670> glide<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.509> along<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.439> project<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
easily glide it along your project and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300 
easily glide it along your project and
you<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> holes<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.990> center<00:01:31.380> mark<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you have the holes the center mark so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.550 
you have the holes the center mark so
I'm<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.329> demonstrate<00:01:33.570> straight

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
I'm just going to demonstrate straight

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.080 
I'm just going to demonstrate straight
that<00:01:34.939> right<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.979> what<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.430> doing<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that right now what I would be doing is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
that right now what I would be doing is
you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.750> always<00:01:39.900> very<00:01:40.890> important<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you know it's always very important to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.870 
you know it's always very important to
line<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:43.229> grid<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.369> part

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
line it up and the grid on this part

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.440 
line it up and the grid on this part
really<00:01:45.180> does<00:01:45.540> help<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.289 

make<00:01:54.450> sure<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:55.170> line<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.860> even<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.880> center

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
make sure my line is even with my center

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.200 
make sure my line is even with my center
point<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.009> using<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.670> sharpie

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
point and then I'm just using a sharpie

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:10.119 
point and then I'm just using a sharpie
and<00:02:01.729> I'm<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:05.509> make<00:02:06.509> my<00:02:06.719> holes<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.350> then

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.830 

guide<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.430> along

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.200 

and<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:15.830> do<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.160> quite<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> few<00:02:16.940> times

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
and you can do that quite a few times

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.520 
and you can do that quite a few times
and<00:02:17.690> then<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.680> would<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.100> your<00:02:19.160> markings

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
and then you would have your markings

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.180 
and then you would have your markings
for<00:02:22.060> making<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.240> holes<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:26.620> what<00:02:27.620> I'm<00:02:27.860> going

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
for making your holes so what I'm going

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.140

to<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.820> now<00:02:29.860> get<00:02:30.860> my<00:02:31.040> machine<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.760> my<00:02:31.940> hole

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to do is now get my machine with my hole

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.240 
to do is now get my machine with my hole
punch<00:02:32.180> die<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:39.470> going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.190> make<00:02:40.970> my<00:02:41.420> holes

your hole punch type make sure that stop
screw<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.170> down<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.700> does<00:02:58.880> not<00:02:59.030> stop<00:02:59.600> your

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
screw is down so it does not stop your

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.130 
screw is down so it does not stop your
handle<00:03:00.560> before<00:03:01.210> before<00:03:02.210> the<00:03:02.570> machine<00:03:02.750> can

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
handle before before the machine can

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.870 
handle before before the machine can
actually<00:03:03.680> punch<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.250> hole<00:03:04.430> through<00:03:04.730> your

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
actually punch the hole through your

rivet I would like you to take a look at

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.910 
rivet I would like you to take a look at
the<00:03:49.470> stop<00:03:50.220> screw<00:03:50.760> when<00:03:51.510> setting<00:03:51.990> rivets<00:03:52.440> you

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
the stop screw when setting rivets you

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.750 
the stop screw when setting rivets you
really<00:03:53.850> want<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.360> get<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> feel<00:03:55.170> for<00:03:55.620> how<00:03:56.400> far

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
really want to get a feel for how far

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.750 
really want to get a feel for how far
down<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.600> handle<00:03:58.020> needs<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.530> go<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.340> what<00:03:59.580> I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
down the handle needs to go so what I

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.420 
down the handle needs to go so what I
always<00:04:00.150> do<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.110> start<00:04:02.120> with<00:04:03.120> my<00:04:03.480> screw<00:04:04.430> all

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
always do is I start with my screw all

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.699 
always do is I start with my screw all
the<00:04:05.700> way<00:04:05.790> up<00:04:06.000> my<00:04:06.030> stop<00:04:06.540> screw<00:04:06.959> all<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.380> way<00:04:07.500> up

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the way up my stop screw all the way up

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.880 
the way up my stop screw all the way up
just<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.430> opposite<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.360> what<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:09.989> was<00:04:10.350> doing

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
just the opposite of what I was doing

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.890 
just the opposite of what I was doing
with<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.520> hole<00:04:11.730> punch<00:04:12.030> die<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.660> where<00:04:12.810> it

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
with the hole punch die to where it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.900 
with the hole punch die to where it
would<00:04:13.020> need<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.470> all<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.620> way<00:04:13.860> down<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.880> I

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
would need to be all the way down so I

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.509 
would need to be all the way down so I
have<00:04:15.360> my<00:04:15.540> screw<00:04:15.870> my<00:04:16.380> stop<00:04:16.709> screw<00:04:17.040> all<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.340> way

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
have my screw my stop screw all the way

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.810 
have my screw my stop screw all the way
up<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.380> can<00:04:19.560> see<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.250> before<00:04:20.430> we

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
up and as you can see and just before we

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.220 
up and as you can see and just before we
set<00:04:21.060> anything<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.900> will<00:04:23.210> stop<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.450> handle<00:04:24.960> and

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
set anything it will stop the handle and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.430 
set anything it will stop the handle and
this<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.370> great<00:04:26.669> because<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:27.810> you're<00:04:28.020> doing<00:04:28.169> a

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
this is great because if you're doing a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.100 
this is great because if you're doing a
lot<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.710> rivets<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.910> you're<00:04:30.540> doing<00:04:30.810> them<00:04:30.960> on

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
lot of rivets and you're doing them on

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.770 
lot of rivets and you're doing them on
the<00:04:31.229> same<00:04:31.470> project<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.400> will<00:04:32.820> stop<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.300> handle

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
the same project it will stop the handle

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.610 
the same project it will stop the handle
at<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.380> same<00:04:34.620> spot<00:04:35.070> every<00:04:35.310> time<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:36.780> start<00:04:37.410> off

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
at the same spot every time so start off

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.280 
at the same spot every time so start off
with<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.460> stop<00:04:38.729> screw<00:04:39.150> all<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.450> way<00:04:39.660> up<00:04:39.960> and

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
with the stop screw all the way up and

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.600 
with the stop screw all the way up and
then<00:04:40.979> what<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:41.970> do<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.890> as<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.070> can<00:04:44.280> see<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
then what you do is as you can see the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.900 
then what you do is as you can see the
bottom<00:04:44.970> die<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.540> in<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.080> 22<00:04:46.979> millimeter<00:04:47.250> dome

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
bottom die is in the 22 millimeter dome

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.520 
bottom die is in the 22 millimeter dome
shape<00:04:48.390> so<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.800> dome<00:04:50.250> shape<00:04:50.280> would<00:04:51.120> be<00:04:51.530> would

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
shape so the dome shape would be would

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.130 
shape so the dome shape would be would
sit<00:04:52.770> nicely<00:04:53.010> into<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.729> bottom<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.960> die

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
sit nicely into the bottom of the die

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.770 
sit nicely into the bottom of the die
and<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.470> top<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.490> die<00:04:56.669> will<00:04:57.030> actually<00:04:57.630> be

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
and the top of the die will actually be

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.440 
and the top of the die will actually be
punching<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.350> setting<00:04:58.770> your<00:04:59.190> your<00:04:59.850> posts

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
punching and setting your your posts

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.100 
punching and setting your your posts
your<00:05:00.630> rivet<00:05:01.040> so<00:05:02.040> what<00:05:02.669> I'm<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.630> do<00:05:03.870> is

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.000 
your rivet so what I'm going to do is
just<00:05:04.500> place<00:05:04.979> my<00:05:05.450> my<00:05:06.450> post<00:05:06.960> through<00:05:07.470> my<00:05:07.650> holes

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
just place my my post through my holes

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.880 
just place my my post through my holes
that<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.340> made<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:08.880> you'd<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.570> working

that I made and you'd be working

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.280 
that I made and you'd be working
opposite<00:05:10.890> your<00:05:11.250> material<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.180> know<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.600> the

opposite your material you know the the
actual<00:05:13.680> rivet<00:05:14.190> shape<00:05:14.460> would<00:05:14.669> go<00:05:14.880> on<00:05:15.030> the

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
actual rivet shape would go on the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.640 
actual rivet shape would go on the
bottom<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:16.400> what<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.430> do<00:05:17.550> is<00:05:17.940> then<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.540> put<00:05:18.870> my<00:05:18.900> my

cap or my dome shape on top of the post

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.960 
cap or my dome shape on top of the post
and<00:05:23.820> then<00:05:24.180> putting<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.750> into<00:05:25.250> my<00:05:26.250> machine<00:05:26.430> like

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
and then putting it into my machine like

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.710 
and then putting it into my machine like
so<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:30.200> now<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.979> just<00:05:32.370> want<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.669> show<00:05:32.849> you<00:05:32.910> when

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
you start off by setting these rivets

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.879 
you start off by setting these rivets
just<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:38.180> little<00:05:38.539> bit<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:38.930> pressure<00:05:41.379> at<00:05:42.379> a<00:05:42.440> time

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
just a little bit of pressure at a time

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.309 
just a little bit of pressure at a time
now

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
now

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.100 
now
you<00:05:45.319> just<00:05:45.590> have<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.919> rivet<00:05:46.280> check<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.539> see<00:05:47.840> if

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
you just have the rivet check to see if

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.689 
you just have the rivet check to see if
you<00:05:48.560> would<00:05:48.830> like<00:05:49.099> it<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.430> little<00:05:49.639> bit<00:05:49.909> tighter

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
you would like it a little bit tighter

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.770 
you would like it a little bit tighter

which I do I'm going to put my stop
screw<00:05:57.199> down<00:05:57.500> a<00:05:57.830> little<00:05:58.460> bit<00:05:58.639> further<00:05:59.000> and<00:05:59.330> then

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389
