00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.959
 while the official launch of the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.150
 season of the Alsace strawberry is 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.770
 scheduled on Tuesday, May 27 a lot of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.880
 producers started the season before 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.929
 due to weather conditions 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.849
 favorable 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 olive green r strawberry producers to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.360
 nordouz for 15 years and president of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.369
 the association of strawberry producers 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
 alsace starts even earlier than 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 others thanks to its strawberry cultivation 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 above ground under glass we made the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 strawberry long enough about three 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 month we start with the strawberry 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.539
 culture so heat in gardens 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.960
 hanging in a greenhouse we start 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.670
 in early April it has just ended and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.860
 the full field has taken over so 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.280
 the plainsong h conde with a veil of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 forcing that starts 10 15 days before 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 strawberries normal so that's it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 ten weeks that we are already there 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.399
 here and so from now on 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
 strawberries of high season where we started 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 until end of June 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 the gaec in the garden of strawberries which he 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.300
 is co manager with his parents cultivates 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.190
 also cereals and flowers in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.420
 free picking strawberry concerns 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.219
 when it's late in the day 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.229
 field of which four are reserved for the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.299
 free picking and 5 at harvest in 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.950
 tray the fresco grown above ground 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.229
 under glass represent a single hectare 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 at the level of culture in August 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 in plant so to plant it must 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 first we form a hillock a hillock 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.390
 covered with a plastic mulch 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.400
 so the plastic film prevents that the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 strawberries after harvesting are not in 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 contact with the earth so there is less 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.100
 problems of dry rot 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 much faster than the earth is a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 second advantage of the film is that it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.579
 there is no chance word that must 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.500
 push 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.360
 there is just a hole that is made in the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.610
 movie for the president to be planted 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.630
 in every 30 cm in August we 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 plant a small strawberry plant this 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 size there and then in the month of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 next June he gives but June of a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.770
 nice harvest what's so nice 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.659
 strawberry is a president of a in what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.189
 Thus was planted'm here in August 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.960
 is now at least from June he gives 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.399
 already fruits strawberry plants 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.780
 are harvested two years in a row then 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.470
 they are ripped off for reasons of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.970
 productivity 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.189
 the plastic is it is removed for 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 be recycled the strawberry culture 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.500
 it is particularly time 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.270
 manual work 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.159
 the gaec job so sixty 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.560
 seasonal employees over a period of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.850
 ranging from a month and a half to two months of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.380
 the more it is a very culture 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 sensitive to climatic hazards 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.890
 so to ensure a minimum of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 harvest that the farm opted for 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.470
 a greenhouse three years ago 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.750
 the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.220
 hostage crops in the greenhouse is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.560
 especially the climate because we can better 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.260
 manage it so we have no thunderstorms 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.360
 hail rain that can not freeze so 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.330
 we have a great advantage we control the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.380
 temperature so here is especially at 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.090
 climate level that's interesting 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.380
 because we can pick all the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.920
 days one does not wet his 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.170
 practice 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.520
 and if not there may be less 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.740
 diseases too as there is no 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.350
 contact with the earth so there is no 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.500
 bacteria that colonize fruits 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.940
 so here and if not at the level of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.160
 insects it is easily regulated and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.390
 auxiliaries that we set up 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.070
 auxiliaries are actually other 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.230
 insects voluntarily installed for 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.760
 pest control potential 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.800
 addition to these drones were 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.140
 dispatched through the greenhouse to play 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.340
 the role of pollinator because here we do not 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.810
 can not count on the wind that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.730
 does a lot of the work at 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.940
 outside in the greenhouse we have a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.140
 better control over the water on the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.880
 fertilizer especially because we do not have 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.680
 heard that name there the strawberry needs 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.000
 so if a need of them we bring 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.620
 the fertilizer also measure daily 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.450
 so also a need we can bring 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.070
 so the plant is taught to him just 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.720
 that she consumes and no more is not 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.300
 of loss as in the fields or 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.800
 respar in the ground so that's 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.739
 also a benefit we save money 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.720
 water and inputs at this level and 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.890
 at the level of pesticides is less 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.470
 also to implement 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.260
 since there is no contact with the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 rain or the earth so the varieties of 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.470
 strawberries grown under greenhouse differ 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.120
 of those grown in the open field 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.590
 reserve the tastiest for free 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.750
 picking and those that keep 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.610
 the best for the tray harvesting the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.080
 multitude of varieties allows to spread the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.060
 picking over a longer period 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.280
 the specifications fring d'alsace 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.280
 obliges us to respect a certain 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.630
 number of constraints 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.730
 already at the level of the treatments one can 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.300
 not do anything 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.830
 we must follow specifications that 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.290
 applies to reasoned cultivation 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.299
 so we have to think about what we do 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.049
 we can not treat everything else 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.810
 share the entire production chain of the 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.430
 planting until the harvest has to be 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.079
 list all the activities we do 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.850
 and it's on the tray with 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.530
 a lot number that codifies each 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.150
 trays that allows us to go up 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.130
 of the whole life of the strawberry in fact 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.990
 here are some 200 hectares of fees 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.419
 are grown in Alsace half 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.970
 reserved for free picking on 25 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.350
 producer members of the association 70% 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.930
 are low Rhine but the proportion 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.250
 progressively evolves to soultz and jean 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.120
 Paul Kessler embarked on the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.800
 strawberry production in 1982 the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.690
 planting is done around August 15th 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.660
 after planting I spent a 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.520
 sprinkling one of the batches for recovery and 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.710
 a few days later I spend the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.900
 harrows the rotary hoe or 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.750
 the cultivator finger which in that one 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.430
 weed only mechanically and on 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.280
 the rank is done manually 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.830
 during a fall and spring the 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.870
 commodities that I use it's 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.180
 so 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.240
 certified products in culture 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.090
 organic I am not certified organic 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.390
 but I do my utmost to ensure that 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.860
 put fruit be correct here the 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.780
 difficulty to grow strawberry is 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.640
 enhanced by a microclimate and a single 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.620
 heterogeneous located in the sector of 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.630
 sous-vosgian hills this soil silt 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.980
 beating and strewn with sharpened stones that 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.060
 prevents cultivation under mulching 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.650
 plastic 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.510
 it's been a difficult year 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.610
 had three months of rain in autumn 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.820
 the floral initiation did not happen 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.470
 correctly and we notice it the ccl 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.380
 plan despite despite that the plots 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.140
 are drained the strawberry plants 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.720
 was under water all winter long and 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.660
 in addition we did not have enough cold the 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.850
 lack of coldness makes that state 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.620
 vegetative was struggling to resume either 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.720
 no time to counter the vagaries 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.250
 climatic this farmer test for the 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.240
 first year a net that cost 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.250
 several thousand euros 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.080
 he installed fences to limit 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.820
 flights and imagine green walls 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.140
 to isolate some plots for free 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.120
 traffic picking 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.470
 the strawberry takes him the most time 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.940
 but do not bring him the most 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.290
 money compared to his other 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.000
 cultures it's a risky choice but 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.860
 after it became a passion you 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.930
 when we do that over 30 years it's 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.150
 really a passion of a year to 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.710
 the other one but said we'll stop but we 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.200
 is so caught up in the gear that 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.420
 andy next year i will do better and 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.260
 it's always lady weather who decides to 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.260
 results
