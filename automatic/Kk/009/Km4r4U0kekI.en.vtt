two totally different worlds and we

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.449 
two totally different worlds and we
really<00:02:23.390> only<00:02:23.420> get<00:02:23.750> 50%<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.620> his<00:02:24.800> stuff<00:02:25.160> which

that your bike is going to go a little
bit<00:03:31.520> quicker<00:03:31.730> let's<00:03:32.390> chat<00:03:32.660> about<00:03:32.690> some<00:03:33.080> of

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
bit quicker let's chat about some of

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.320 
bit quicker let's chat about some of
them<00:03:33.319> real<00:03:33.470> fast<00:03:33.740> so<00:03:33.980> if<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:34.760> flip<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.120> thing

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
them real fast so if we flip this thing

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.730 
them real fast so if we flip this thing
around<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.840> can<00:03:35.930> see<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.140> business<00:03:36.500> part

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
around so you can see the business part

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.100 
around so you can see the business part
of

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.840 
of
this<00:03:37.200> particular<00:03:38.040> exhaust<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.580> part<00:03:38.760> that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
this particular exhaust the part that

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.400 
this particular exhaust the part that
you<00:03:38.910> don't<00:03:38.970> normally<00:03:39.210> see<00:03:39.450> you'll<00:03:40.080> notice

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
you don't normally see you'll notice

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.660 
you don't normally see you'll notice
here<00:03:40.650> there's<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.130> difference<00:03:41.520> in<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
here there's a difference in the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.640 
here there's a difference in the
diameter<00:03:42.060> pipe<00:03:42.300> these<00:03:42.510> are<00:03:42.660> stepped<00:03:43.080> systems

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
diameter pipe these are stepped systems

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.070 
diameter pipe these are stepped systems
the<00:03:44.130> exhaust<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.760> flowing<00:03:45.300> through<00:03:45.510> here<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
the exhaust is flowing through here and

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.750 
the exhaust is flowing through here and
as<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.620> hits<00:03:46.740> each<00:03:46.920> one<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.220> these<00:03:47.280> junctures

as it hits each one of these junctures

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.970 
as it hits each one of these junctures
it<00:03:47.940> actually<00:03:48.240> opens<00:03:48.960> up<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.320> fill<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.770> new

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
it actually opens up to fill the new

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.100 
it actually opens up to fill the new
larger<00:03:50.610> space<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.270> as<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.630> shoots<00:03:51.870> through

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
larger space and as it shoots through

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.320 
larger space and as it shoots through
they're<00:03:52.290> keeping<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.310> velocity<00:03:53.820> up<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.120> makes

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
they're keeping the velocity up it makes

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.730 
they're keeping the velocity up it makes
the<00:03:54.480> actual<00:03:54.720> piston<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.260> your<00:03:55.350> engine<00:03:55.560> do<00:03:55.710> a

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
the actual piston in your engine do a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.380 
the actual piston in your engine do a
little<00:03:56.010> less<00:03:56.130> work<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.520> far<00:03:56.670> as<00:03:56.760> clearing<00:03:57.180> out

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
little less work as far as clearing out

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.990 
little less work as far as clearing out
that<00:03:57.660> pipe<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.650> as<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.220> exhaust<00:03:59.700> keeps

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that pipe so so as that exhaust keeps

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.820 
that pipe so so as that exhaust keeps
its<00:04:00.180> velocity<00:04:00.450> up<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.050> what<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.440> effectively

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
its velocity up and what it effectively

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.040 
its velocity up and what it effectively
means<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.190> your<00:04:02.400> engine<00:04:02.820> is<00:04:03.030> free<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.690> spend

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
means is your engine is free to spend

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.930 
means is your engine is free to spend
its<00:04:04.230> time<00:04:04.320> making<00:04:04.709> horsepower<00:04:05.220> rather<00:04:05.700> than

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
its time making horsepower rather than

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.060 
its time making horsepower rather than
pushing<00:04:06.209> exhaust<00:04:06.750> gas<00:04:07.020> out<00:04:07.230> now<00:04:07.709> moving<00:04:07.950> to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
pushing exhaust gas out now moving to

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.500 
pushing exhaust gas out now moving to
the<00:04:08.100> mega<00:04:08.340> power<00:04:08.580> system<00:04:09.030> behind<00:04:09.300> me<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.480> can

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
the mega power system behind me you can

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.210 
the mega power system behind me you can
see<00:04:09.630> here<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.290> thing<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.560> actually<00:04:10.950> kind<00:04:11.160> of

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
see here this thing is actually kind of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.770 
see here this thing is actually kind of
cool<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:11.490> it<00:04:11.640> uses<00:04:11.760> equal<00:04:12.330> length<00:04:12.540> header

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
cool because it uses equal length header

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.540 
cool because it uses equal length header
pipes<00:04:13.080> if<00:04:13.290> you'll<00:04:13.650> notice<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.130> distance

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
pipes if you'll notice the distance

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.849 
pipes if you'll notice the distance
between<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.480> jugs<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:16.019> your<00:04:16.169> particular<00:04:16.470> bike

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
between the jugs on your particular bike

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.099 
between the jugs on your particular bike
are<00:04:17.459> different<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> front<00:04:18.329> has<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.510> longer<00:04:18.989> way

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
are different the front has a longer way

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.690 
are different the front has a longer way
to<00:04:19.169> travel<00:04:19.440> than<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.709> rear<00:04:19.890> does<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.549> what

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
to travel than the rear does so what

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.740 
to travel than the rear does so what
they<00:04:20.790> do<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.030> they<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:21.209> make<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> rear

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
they do is they actually make the rear

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.390 
they do is they actually make the rear
pipe<00:04:21.959> longer<00:04:22.380> by<00:04:22.500> jogging<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.980> up<00:04:23.070> towards<00:04:23.310> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
pipe longer by jogging it up towards the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.770 
pipe longer by jogging it up towards the
front<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.669> then<00:04:23.760> cutting<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.240> back<00:04:24.480> again

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
front and then cutting it back again

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.780 
front and then cutting it back again
what<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.230> does<00:04:25.530> is<00:04:25.740> helps<00:04:26.040> each<00:04:26.220> cylinder

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
what that does is helps each cylinder

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.880 
what that does is helps each cylinder
work<00:04:27.330> equally<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.050> help<00:04:28.290> helps<00:04:28.710> each

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
work equally and help helps each

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.770 
work equally and help helps each
cylinder<00:04:29.220> eventually<00:04:29.760> scavenge<00:04:30.450> because

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
cylinder eventually scavenge because

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.270 
cylinder eventually scavenge because
these<00:04:30.930> cylinders<00:04:31.260> fire<00:04:31.560> at<00:04:31.770> different<00:04:32.070> times

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
these cylinders fire at different times

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.909 
these cylinders fire at different times
one<00:04:33.210> cylinder<00:04:33.570> pulling<00:04:33.990> exhaust<00:04:34.320> out<00:04:34.530> can

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
one cylinder pulling exhaust out can

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.100 
one cylinder pulling exhaust out can
actually<00:04:35.190> help<00:04:35.340> suck<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.240> incoming<00:04:36.690> air<00:04:36.930> and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
off they really look awesome but they do

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.829 
off they really look awesome but they do
have<00:06:05.939> a<00:06:05.969> little<00:06:06.179> bit<00:06:06.360> of<00:06:06.449> an<00:06:06.509> installation

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 
have a little bit of an installation

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.149 
have a little bit of an installation
component<00:06:07.499> to<00:06:07.559> them<00:06:07.649> you<00:06:07.740> do<00:06:07.860> actually<00:06:08.009> have

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
component to them you do actually have

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.709 
component to them you do actually have
to<00:06:08.309> put<00:06:08.490> those<00:06:08.610> things<00:06:08.669> on<00:06:09.029> there<00:06:09.209> and<00:06:09.330> it<00:06:09.599> adds

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
to put those things on there and it adds

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.299 
to put those things on there and it adds
a<00:06:09.809> little<00:06:09.959> bit<00:06:10.169> of<00:06:10.229> complexity<00:06:10.649> to<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:10.919> job

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:11.309 
a little bit of complexity to the job

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.949 
a little bit of complexity to the job
nothing<00:06:11.939> most<00:06:12.179> of<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.389> shouldn't<00:06:12.569> be<00:06:12.689> able<00:06:12.869> to

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:12.959 
nothing most of you shouldn't be able to

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:14.239 
nothing most of you shouldn't be able to
handle<00:06:13.229> without<00:06:13.319> some<00:06:13.589> basic<00:06:13.979> hand<00:06:14.099> tools

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:14.249 
handle without some basic hand tools

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.820 
handle without some basic hand tools
where<00:06:15.089> I<00:06:15.119> think<00:06:15.419> also<00:06:15.839> this<00:06:15.959> kind<00:06:16.229> of<00:06:16.289> kind<00:06:16.679> of

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
where I think also this kind of kind of

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.379 
where I think also this kind of kind of
jumps<00:06:17.159> into<00:06:17.339> that<00:06:17.429> to<00:06:17.580> beard<00:06:17.819> category<00:06:18.270> is

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
jumps into that to beard category is

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.730 
jumps into that to beard category is
that<00:06:18.569> you<00:06:18.659> have<00:06:18.809> to<00:06:18.929> think<00:06:19.169> of<00:06:19.289> your<00:06:19.409> exhaust

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
that you have to think of your exhaust

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.399 
that you have to think of your exhaust
as<00:06:19.979> part<00:06:20.309> of<00:06:20.399> a<00:06:20.520> part<00:06:20.939> of<00:06:20.999> a<00:06:21.119> larger<00:06:21.569> system<00:06:22.050> of

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
as part of a part of a larger system of

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:24.320 
as part of a part of a larger system of
components<00:06:22.740> your<00:06:23.399> exhaust<00:06:23.729> is<00:06:23.909> just<00:06:24.089> one

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
components your exhaust is just one

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.359 
components your exhaust is just one
piece<00:06:24.659> in<00:06:24.899> getting<00:06:25.199> horsepower<00:06:25.679> out<00:06:25.919> of<00:06:25.979> your

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:26.369 
piece in getting horsepower out of your

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.489 
piece in getting horsepower out of your
bike<00:06:26.610> so<00:06:27.119> really<00:06:27.479> this<00:06:27.779> may<00:06:28.110> be<00:06:28.169> done<00:06:28.469> in

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:28.499 
bike so really this may be done in

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:29.959 
bike so really this may be done in
conjunction<00:06:28.709> with<00:06:29.099> some<00:06:29.309> other<00:06:29.490> stuff<00:06:29.759> those
