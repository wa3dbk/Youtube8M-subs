I see with a lot of players as they're

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.710 
I see with a lot of players as they're
hitting<00:00:17.710> the<00:00:17.830> ball<00:00:18.090> their<00:00:19.090> elbows<00:00:19.450> doing<00:00:19.689> a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
hitting the ball their elbows doing a

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.030 
hitting the ball their elbows doing a
lot<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:19.960> movement<00:00:20.290> okay

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
lot of movement okay

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.999 
lot of movement okay
as<00:00:21.579> I<00:00:21.730> demonstrated<00:00:22.660> it<00:00:22.809> first<00:00:23.110> I<00:00:23.439> showed<00:00:23.890> you

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
as I demonstrated it first I showed you

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.859 
as I demonstrated it first I showed you
how<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.189> forearm<00:00:24.700> with<00:00:25.119> doing<00:00:25.360> more<00:00:25.689> of<00:00:25.750> the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
how the forearm with doing more of the

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.049 
how the forearm with doing more of the
movement<00:00:26.230> in<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.410> shoulders<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:27.070> elbow<00:00:27.880> does

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:28.059 
movement in the shoulders the elbow does

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.370 
movement in the shoulders the elbow does
not<00:00:28.270> need<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.630> lift<00:00:28.869> up

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
not need to lift up

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.889 
not need to lift up
sometimes<00:00:30.279> we'll<00:00:30.610> tell<00:00:31.390> players<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.779> it's

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:31.899 
sometimes we'll tell players that it's

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.959 
sometimes we'll tell players that it's
like<00:00:31.989> a<00:00:32.020> saluting<00:00:32.590> motion<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.579> take<00:00:33.820> the

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
like a saluting motion you take the

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.389 
like a saluting motion you take the
racket<00:00:34.149> you<00:00:34.660> bring<00:00:34.899> it<00:00:34.989> up<00:00:35.109> to<00:00:35.199> your<00:00:35.350> head<00:00:35.739> you

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
racket you bring it up to your head you

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.090 
racket you bring it up to your head you
don't<00:00:36.579> see<00:00:36.789> people<00:00:37.379> saluting<00:00:38.379> like<00:00:38.500> this<00:00:38.739> okay

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
don't see people saluting like this okay

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.220 
don't see people saluting like this okay
keep<00:00:39.789> that<00:00:39.820> elbow<00:00:40.210> down<00:00:40.539> because<00:00:40.870> we<00:00:40.989> need<00:00:41.109> to

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
keep that elbow down because we need to

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.319 
keep that elbow down because we need to
have<00:00:41.379> some<00:00:41.559> leverage<00:00:41.829> in<00:00:42.579> order<00:00:42.789> to<00:00:42.910> make<00:00:43.149> some

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
have some leverage in order to make some

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.180 
have some leverage in order to make some

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
slightly below the ball come into the

slightly below the ball come into the
ball<00:00:48.039> in<00:00:48.249> an<00:00:48.339> upward<00:00:48.699> motion<00:00:48.909> and

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
ball in an upward motion and

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.720 
ball in an upward motion and
follow-through<00:00:50.199> without<00:00:50.859> letting<00:00:51.609> that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
follow-through without letting that

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.189 
follow-through without letting that
elbow<00:00:52.289> come<00:00:53.289> up<00:00:54.069> here<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:55.480> path<00:00:55.749> of<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.050> ball

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
elbow come up here the path of the ball

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.139 
elbow come up here the path of the ball
where<00:00:56.559> I'm<00:00:56.649> aiming<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.519> where<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.850> racket

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
where I'm aiming it is where the racket

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.819 
where I'm aiming it is where the racket
should<00:00:58.179> be<00:00:58.300> going<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:59.050> racket<00:00:59.379> point<00:00:59.620> in<00:00:59.710> this

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
should be going the racket point in this

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.160 
should be going the racket point in this
motion<00:01:00.309> from<00:01:00.909> a<00:01:01.059> biomechanical<00:01:01.420> standpoint

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
motion from a biomechanical standpoint

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.750 
motion from a biomechanical standpoint
the<00:01:02.319> elbow<00:01:02.620> doesn't<00:01:02.829> really<00:01:03.100> need<00:01:03.219> to<00:01:03.280> lifted

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
the elbow doesn't really need to lifted

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.660 
the elbow doesn't really need to lifted
lifted<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.570> much<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:05.110> think<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.490> where

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
lifted that much I think this is where

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.270 
lifted that much I think this is where
I'm<00:01:06.730> going<00:01:06.910> with<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.180> ball<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.740> is<00:01:09.100> only

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
I'm going with the ball this is only

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.800 
I'm going with the ball this is only
going<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.490> help<00:01:09.580> dump<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.120> into<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.450> net<00:01:10.630> when

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
going to help dump it into the net when

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.870 
going to help dump it into the net when
the<00:01:10.900> elbow<00:01:11.140> lift<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:12.040> racket<00:01:12.190> angle<00:01:12.400> changes

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
the elbow lift the racket angle changes

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.480 
the elbow lift the racket angle changes
we<00:01:13.810> want<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.110> keep<00:01:14.260> that<00:01:14.440> racket<00:01:14.680> angle<00:01:14.950> as

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
we want to keep that racket angle as

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.730 
we want to keep that racket angle as
consistent<00:01:16.210> through<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.540> ball<00:01:16.720> as<00:01:16.930> possible

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
consistent through the ball as possible

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.010 
consistent through the ball as possible
anytime<00:01:18.370> you<00:01:18.490> add<00:01:18.610> an<00:01:18.730> extra<00:01:18.940> movement<00:01:19.450> you're

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
anytime you add an extra movement you're

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.480 
anytime you add an extra movement you're
increasing<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.590> likelihood<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.220> racket

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
increasing the likelihood of the racket

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.510 
increasing the likelihood of the racket
angle<00:01:21.550> changing<00:01:22.120> here<00:01:23.040> track<00:01:24.040> angle<00:01:24.280> right

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
angle changing here track angle right

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.760 
angle changing here track angle right
now<00:01:24.730> if<00:01:24.940> I<00:01:25.030> were<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.240> hot<00:01:25.810> dogs<00:01:26.140> go<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.590> way

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
now if I were the hot dogs go this way

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.050 
now if I were the hot dogs go this way
that<00:01:27.040> can<00:01:27.280> help<00:01:27.460> me<00:01:27.550> hit<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.760> ball<00:01:27.820> mount

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
that can help me hit the ball mount

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.510 
that can help me hit the ball mount
direction<00:01:28.540> we<00:01:29.230> want<00:01:29.410> to<00:01:29.470> just<00:01:29.650> do<00:01:30.070> enough<00:01:30.310> to

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
direction we want to just do enough to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.740 
direction we want to just do enough to
get<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.730> ball<00:01:30.760> in<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.000> direction<00:01:31.270> let<00:01:31.660> our

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
get the ball in that direction let our

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.740 
get the ball in that direction let our
body<00:01:32.020> weight<00:01:32.400> here's<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.550> extra<00:01:33.940> push<00:01:34.270> okay

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
body weight here's that extra push okay

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.750 
body weight here's that extra push okay
so<00:01:34.810> keep<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.710> elbow<00:01:35.980> down<00:01:36.160> keep<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.910> elbow

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.540 

the<00:01:42.760> racket<00:01:43.270> angle<00:01:43.980> we<00:01:44.980> want<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.430> it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
the racket angle we want to have it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.540 
the racket angle we want to have it
pointed<00:01:45.970> in<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.180> direction<00:01:46.560> versus<00:01:47.560> this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
pointed in this direction versus this

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.700 
pointed in this direction versus this
way<00:01:48.790> we<00:01:48.910> won't<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.120> it<00:01:49.470> pointing<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
way we won't have it pointing to the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.250 
way we won't have it pointing to the
sides<00:01:50.920> we<00:01:51.480> have<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.600> greatest<00:01:52.810> amount<00:01:53.140> of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
sides we have the greatest amount of

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.440 
sides we have the greatest amount of
area<00:01:53.470> that's<00:01:54.220> we<00:01:54.370> hit<00:01:54.640> we're<00:01:54.760> gonna<00:01:54.880> come<00:01:55.120> up

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
area that's we hit we're gonna come up

tennis<00:06:23.700> I<00:06:24.030> think<00:06:24.510> you<00:06:25.500> have<00:06:25.650> to<00:06:25.740> work<00:06:25.950> for<00:06:26.160> the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
tennis I think you have to work for the

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.980 
tennis I think you have to work for the
point<00:06:26.430> every<00:06:26.610> time<00:06:26.790> you<00:06:26.880> hit<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.150> ball<00:06:27.300> get

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
point every time you hit the ball get

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.840 
point every time you hit the ball get
back<00:06:28.140> into<00:06:28.320> ready<00:06:28.500> position<00:06:28.650> get<00:06:29.520> back<00:06:29.669> into

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
back into ready position get back into

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.760 
back into ready position get back into
ready<00:06:30.030> position<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.570> do<00:06:30.720> that<00:06:30.930> you'll<00:06:31.590> find

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
ready position you do that you'll find

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.350 
ready position you do that you'll find
out<00:06:31.919> that<00:06:32.070> maybe<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.400> third<00:06:32.610> shot<00:06:32.940> wasn't<00:06:33.330> a

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
out that maybe the third shot wasn't a

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240 
out that maybe the third shot wasn't a
direct<00:06:33.570> winner<00:06:33.960> but<00:06:34.470> the<00:06:34.530> fourth<00:06:34.860> job<00:06:35.100> was

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
direct winner but the fourth job was

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.700 
direct winner but the fourth job was
easy<00:06:35.570> just<00:06:36.570> have<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:36.780> be<00:06:36.900> willing<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.410> not

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
easy just have to be willing to not

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.950 
easy just have to be willing to not
outlast<00:06:38.280> doesn't<00:06:39.210> mean<00:06:39.300> hit<00:06:39.419> it's<00:06:39.570> off<00:06:39.750> if

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
outlast doesn't mean hit it's off if

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.630 
outlast doesn't mean hit it's off if
this<00:06:40.110> means<00:06:40.320> hitting<00:06:40.980> it<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:41.190> being<00:06:41.340> ready

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
this means hitting it and being ready

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.270 
this means hitting it and being ready
don't<00:06:42.419> put<00:06:42.630> so<00:06:42.810> much<00:06:42.930> into<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.350> shot<00:06:43.590> but<00:06:44.160> you

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
don't put so much into the shot but you

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.890 
don't put so much into the shot but you
know<00:06:44.430> you've<00:06:44.640> put<00:06:45.000> yourself<00:06:45.090> out<00:06:45.450> of<00:06:45.480> position

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
know you've put yourself out of position

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.330 
know you've put yourself out of position
because<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.110> better<00:06:46.380> player<00:06:46.650> will<00:06:46.860> block<00:06:47.100> the

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
because a better player will block the

because a better player will block the
ball<00:06:47.490> back<00:06:48.390> onto<00:06:48.600> the<00:06:48.750> table<00:06:49.080> where<00:06:49.230> you're

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.659 

big<00:06:57.570> mistake<00:06:58.020> everyone<00:06:58.500> makes<00:06:58.680> is<00:06:58.830> they<00:06:59.370> move

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.900 
into their forehand they overshoot it
and<00:07:01.440> then<00:07:02.040> they<00:07:02.160> can't<00:07:02.430> use<00:07:02.580> any<00:07:02.729> weight

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910
