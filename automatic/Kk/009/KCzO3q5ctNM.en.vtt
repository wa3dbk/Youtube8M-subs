00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.590
 hello good to all friends of 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.360
 health habitat 98 and welcome to this 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.820
 new video in which we will be 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.760
 learning to download our site 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.170
 road book out of the help good 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.270
 We hope you like this 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.560
 game is for our xbox 360 and also 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.439
 for our play station 3 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.970
 so good if you like this idea 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.769
 let's start with our quickly 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.060
 but first do not forget to stop by the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.740
 social networks that I'm leaving in the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.080
 description and good I invite you also to 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.360
 subscribe for much more so good 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.130
 how are we going to start 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.530
 good to download our game for 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.940
 either of the two consoles 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.010
 we will open either of these two 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.750
 kids, let's not give them two links, but for 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.730
 which we will have to anticipate 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.800
 have a program called youtube 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.850
 which then I will leave them in the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.980
 description so that you what 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.780
 download and install easily so 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.610
 good when we have already had that step 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.559
 that requirement then we can use 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.390
 either of these two links depends on 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.980
 the console that we have so good 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.840
 for example if we have a play station 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.580
 3 well it's the link of the prison 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.090
 in three and we go to our browser 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.460
 and we write it or copy it and paste it 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.830
 and well let's access it and well let's go 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.840
 with you they can see it and 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.369
 leaves a page click on which then 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.200
 we will wait for the five seconds that 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.310
 find here and we give you to jump 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.580
 advertising 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.040
 well this will be quickly not 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.350
 we will wait for the time he asks us and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.600
 as you can see it is a mediafire page 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.240
 then we'll download it just 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 give it to donald and ready and we will download 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.290
 a file with which when we will have 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 what to download 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.200
 so, well, they have not 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.820
 downloaded for either of the two 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 consoles that you have then 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.690
 you are going to choose any of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.890
 these two files let's say no to 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.420
 any of the two known that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.310
 now for playstation3 for example 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.990
 let's double click on the file that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.100
 we have downloaded here we choose the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 folder where we want it to be 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.970
 download and good in the part of here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.340
 we'll see a lot of rar files 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.780
 we plug and we give ok and good this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.550
 It depends on the internet speed to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.650
 that our download is over 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.420
 download then good is worth the 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.030
 redundancy in that but good we go 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 to bandwidth and we will give it to high 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.500
 and good care we know in this 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.630
 first file without files and we 're leaving 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.670
 until the last we are going to priority 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.110
 vial as they can see some tutorials 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510
 in which as a woman you can 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.459
 help accelerate this program and that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.930
 the downloads something much faster so 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.610
 How good I hope it can serve you and 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.610
 with that 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.560
 download them in a folder like this 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.570
 like this and more or less like many 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.970
 files in which you can only 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.770
 we will extract in the first file 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.090
 in the first file of the list you 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.550
 we will give extract and we will leave a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.610
 folder as it divides in and you what 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.500
 they will go through usb or by dividing good 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.540
 this depends on how you pass to 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.670
 games to your console so good hope 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.130
 that this may serve you in truth the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.630
 idea is very good so if you have 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.770
 some doubt a concern because no 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.209
 forget to comment 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.980
 I hope that values and effort like me 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.750
 like to spend with your friends a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.030
 colleague of yours who likes this kind of 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.270
 games and good do not forget then put my 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.970
