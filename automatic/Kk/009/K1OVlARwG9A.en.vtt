00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.500 
um like I said the design ponies will
start<00:00:38.989> with<00:00:39.050> rainbow<00:00:39.350> dash<00:00:39.590> first<00:00:40.059> um<00:00:41.059> I've

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
start with rainbow dash first um I've

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.360 
start with rainbow dash first um I've
mixed<00:00:41.750> feelings<00:00:42.140> about<00:00:42.230> these<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:42.829> love<00:00:43.190> the

mixed feelings about these I love the
shape<00:00:43.609> of<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.789> body<00:00:44.059> it's<00:00:44.449> actually<00:00:45.050> I

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
shape of the body it's actually I

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.889 
shape of the body it's actually I
believe<00:00:45.590> anyway<00:00:45.949> um<00:00:46.340> either<00:00:47.210> really<00:00:47.510> close<00:00:47.719> to

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
believe anyway um either really close to

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.689 
believe anyway um either really close to
or<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.140> same<00:00:48.350> multi-user<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.160> fashion<00:00:49.489> style

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
or the same multi-user the fashion style

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.700 
or the same multi-user the fashion style
ponies<00:00:50.030> because<00:00:50.840> when<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.050> compare<00:00:51.469> them<00:00:51.679> to

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
ponies because when you compare them to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.040 
ponies because when you compare them to
a<00:00:51.859> fashion<00:00:52.280> style<00:00:52.550> pony<00:00:52.850> they're<00:00:53.600> actually<00:00:53.929> at

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
a fashion style pony they're actually at

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.560 
a fashion style pony they're actually at
about<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.469> same<00:00:54.500> height<00:00:54.859> honestly<00:00:55.550> if<00:00:56.449> you

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
about the same height honestly if you

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.500 
about the same height honestly if you
don't<00:00:56.719> include<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.929> hard<00:00:57.170> hair<00:00:57.399> but<00:00:58.399> yeah<00:00:59.269> I

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
don't include the hard hair but yeah I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.020 
don't include the hard hair but yeah I
think<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.620> face<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:01.100> little<00:01:01.190> bit<00:01:01.640> different

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
think the face is a little bit different

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.320 
think the face is a little bit different
but<00:01:02.210> only<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.629> like<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.899> cheeks<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:05.120> wing

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
but only in like the cheeks and the wing

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.690 
but only in like the cheeks and the wing
design<00:01:05.830> ignoring<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.950> fact<00:01:07.160> that<00:01:07.220> got<00:01:07.490> paint

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
design ignoring the fact that got paint

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.060 
design ignoring the fact that got paint
on<00:01:07.820> it<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.420> white<00:01:08.660> is<00:01:08.990> actually<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> think

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
on it and it's white is actually I think

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.649 
on it and it's white is actually I think
a<00:01:10.100> better<00:01:10.250> design<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.880> original<00:01:11.060> fashion

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
a better design in the original fashion

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.270 
a better design in the original fashion
styles<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.110> Sevilla<00:01:12.439> caterpie's<00:01:12.950> hair

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
styles because Sevilla caterpie's hair

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.940 
styles because Sevilla caterpie's hair
just<00:01:13.549> looks<00:01:13.670> like<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.939> cluster<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.950> feathers

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
just looks like a cluster of feathers

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.770 
just looks like a cluster of feathers
well<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:16.820> just<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:17.090> more<00:01:17.299> accurate<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
well that just is more accurate to the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.889 
well that just is more accurate to the
show<00:01:18.430> now<00:01:19.430> these<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.970> really<00:01:20.509> meant<00:01:20.840> for

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
show now these are really meant for

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.359 
show now these are really meant for
little<00:01:21.259> girls<00:01:21.409> but<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.799> think<00:01:22.070> there<00:01:22.220> would<00:01:22.340> be

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
little girls but I think there would be

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.950 
little girls but I think there would be
really<00:01:22.670> good<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:23.450> people<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.750> like<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
really good to for people that like the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.950 
really good to for people that like the
customized<00:01:24.409> um<00:01:25.119> they<00:01:26.119> come<00:01:26.329> with<00:01:26.509> each<00:01:26.780> one

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
customized um they come with each one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.749 
customized um they come with each one
comes<00:01:27.079> to<00:01:27.229> two<00:01:27.380> different<00:01:27.590> color<00:01:27.890> markers<00:01:28.460> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
comes to two different color markers and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.889 
comes to two different color markers and
a<00:01:28.850> bunch<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.060> stickers<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.509> can<00:01:29.630> put<00:01:29.750> all

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
a bunch of stickers that you can put all

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.230 
a bunch of stickers that you can put all
over<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.290> pony<00:01:30.470> but<00:01:31.430> those<00:01:31.579> I've<00:01:31.790> set<00:01:31.939> aside

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
over the pony but those I've set aside

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.300 
over the pony but those I've set aside
because<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.290> don't<00:01:33.470> intend<00:01:33.649> on<00:01:33.799> coloring<00:01:34.040> these

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
because I don't intend on coloring these

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.330 
because I don't intend on coloring these
um<00:01:35.200> like<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.290> said<00:01:36.320> they're<00:01:36.590> really<00:01:36.829> welds<00:01:37.189> on

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
um like I said they're really welds on

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.010 
um like I said they're really welds on
these<00:01:37.880> are<00:01:38.000> actually<00:01:38.329> my<00:01:38.540> opinion<00:01:38.869> better

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
these are actually my opinion better

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.020 
these are actually my opinion better
looking<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.590> original<00:01:40.070> Funko<00:01:40.430> rainbow<00:01:40.820> dash

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
looking the original Funko rainbow dash

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.600 
looking the original Funko rainbow dash
which<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.450> actually<00:01:41.570> have<00:01:41.869> right<00:01:42.140> here<00:01:42.610> they're

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
which I actually have right here they're

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.530 
which I actually have right here they're
smaller<00:01:44.030> than<00:01:44.420> these<00:01:44.600> ones<00:01:44.899> um<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.329> think

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
smaller than these ones um and I think

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.209 
smaller than these ones um and I think
the<00:01:47.630> hair<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:47.990> molded<00:01:48.439> a<00:01:48.500> bit<00:01:48.649> better<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:48.979> well

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
the hair is molded a bit better as well

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.420
