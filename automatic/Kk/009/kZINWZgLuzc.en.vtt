matte<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.870> guess<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.190> basically<00:02:47.370> dab<00:02:47.820> it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
matte I guess so just basically dab it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.000 
matte I guess so just basically dab it
in<00:02:48.090> like<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.570> then<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.080> rub<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.830> all
