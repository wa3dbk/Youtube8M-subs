255<00:00:07.730> so<00:00:08.730> here<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.090> looking<00:00:09.210> for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
255 so here we're looking for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.549 
255 so here we're looking for
explanations

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
explanations

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.770 
explanations
for<00:00:10.800> changes<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.969> rate<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.150> transpiration

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
for changes in the rate of transpiration

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.970 
for changes in the rate of transpiration
which<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:14.099> water<00:00:14.429> loss<00:00:14.759> from<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> leaf<00:00:15.680> due<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
which is water loss from the leaf due to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.580 
which is water loss from the leaf due to
humidity<00:00:17.490> wind<00:00:18.210> speed<00:00:18.510> temperature<00:00:19.050> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
humidity wind speed temperature and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.509 
humidity wind speed temperature and
light<00:00:20.130> intensity<00:00:20.869> so<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.080> return<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
light intensity so if we return to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.120 
light intensity so if we return to
transpiration<00:00:23.600> transpiration<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.289> loss

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
transpiration transpiration is the loss

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.109 
transpiration transpiration is the loss
of<00:00:26.369> water<00:00:26.900> through<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> leaf<00:00:28.699> it's<00:00:29.699> caused<00:00:30.090> by

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
of water through the leaf it's caused by

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.010 
of water through the leaf it's caused by
the<00:00:30.480> evaporation<00:00:34.370> for<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> occur<00:00:36.020> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the evaporation for this to occur the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.979 
the evaporation for this to occur the
water<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.770> changed<00:00:38.450> from<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.780> liquid

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
water has to be changed from the liquid

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.799 
water has to be changed from the liquid
phase<00:00:42.079> into<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> gas<00:00:43.469> phase<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.809> then

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
phase into the gas phase and then

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.389 
phase into the gas phase and then
there's<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.180> diffusion<00:00:49.309> through<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
there's the diffusion through the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.139 
there's the diffusion through the
stomata<00:00:50.730> pore<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> remember

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
stomata pore so they have to remember

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.139 
stomata pore so they have to remember
these<00:00:54.449> factors<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.920> understanding<00:00:56.550> our

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
these factors in our understanding our

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.049 
these factors in our understanding our
explanations<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:01.879> absorption<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
explanations so the absorption of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.070 
explanations so the absorption of
sunshine<00:01:04.309> generates<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> heat<00:01:06.080> which

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
sunshine generates the heat which

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.179 
sunshine generates the heat which
transforms<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> water<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> leaf

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
transforms the water here in the leaf

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.969 
transforms the water here in the leaf
into<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> gas<00:01:12.390> phase<00:01:12.470> here<00:01:13.470> above<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
into the gas phase here above the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.609 
into the gas phase here above the
stomata<00:01:14.189> pore<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> important

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
stomata pore and then the important

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.359 
stomata pore and then the important
thing<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.520> diffusion<00:01:18.240> through<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> port

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
thing is the diffusion through the port

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
thing is the diffusion through the port
so<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.400> need<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.119> about<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:24.110> diffusion

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
so we need to think about the diffusion

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.580 
so we need to think about the diffusion
gradient<00:01:25.680> from<00:01:26.640> inside<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> pore<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
gradient from inside the pore in this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.690 
gradient from inside the pore in this
region<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:31.350> region<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.549> we

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
region here and this region here so we

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.020 
region here and this region here so we
call<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.130> let's<00:01:35.430> call<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.790> one

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
call this one a and let's call that one

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.539 
call this one a and let's call that one
B

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
B

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.399 
B
so<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:41.060> concentration

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.830 

gradient

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.020 

for<00:01:50.520> water<00:01:51.720> vapor

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.929 

if

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
if

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.700 
if
there's<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.810> big<00:01:58.259> difference

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.059 

then<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.729> would<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.799> high<00:02:05.799> rate<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
then we would have high rate of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.089 
then we would have high rate of
transpiration<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.260> difference

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.220 

between<00:02:16.909> a<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.420> B<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:18.680> small<00:02:19.870> then<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:21.079> will

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
between a and B it's small then we will

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.530 
between a and B it's small then we will
have<00:02:21.439> a<00:02:21.730> low<00:02:22.730> rate<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.469> transpiration<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
have a low rate of transpiration so the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.509 
have a low rate of transpiration so the
factors<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.049> would<00:02:27.469> cause<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:28.069> large

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
factors that would cause a large

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.080 
factors that would cause a large
difference<00:02:29.379> would<00:02:30.379> be<00:02:30.620> for<00:02:30.920> instance<00:02:31.069> if<00:02:31.730> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
difference would be for instance if the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.920 
difference would be for instance if the
humidity<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:33.200> was<00:02:33.469> very<00:02:33.829> low<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.500> low<00:02:37.930> you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
humidity here was very low so low you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.720 
humidity here was very low so low you
may<00:02:39.819> thirteen<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:41.389> would<00:02:41.569> be<00:02:41.750> one<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
may thirteen that would be one and the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.239 
may thirteen that would be one and the
second<00:02:44.209> one<00:02:44.450> would<00:02:44.989> be<00:02:45.049> if<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.409> wind<00:02:45.680> blows

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:46.249 
second one would be if the wind blows

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.270 
second one would be if the wind blows
away<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.760> water<00:02:47.180> vapor<00:02:47.629> here<00:02:48.169> that<00:02:48.980> will<00:02:49.129> keep

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
away the water vapor here that will keep

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:59.860 
away the water vapor here that will keep
the<00:02:49.549> difference<00:02:50.299> large<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:51.409> high<00:02:51.680> winds

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.369 

temperature<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.310> temperature<00:03:01.879> is<00:03:02.060> high

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
temperature if the temperature is high

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.059 
temperature if the temperature is high
we'll<00:03:03.379> get<00:03:03.560> more<00:03:03.739> evaporation<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.769> high

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
we'll get more evaporation so high

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.870 
we'll get more evaporation so high
temperature

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.750 

and<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.570> fourth<00:03:11.960> one<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.290> light<00:03:12.620> intensity<00:03:13.160> so

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
and the fourth one is light intensity so

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.790 
and the fourth one is light intensity so
with<00:03:13.910> high<00:03:14.090> light<00:03:14.420> intensity<00:03:14.990> we<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.440> high

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
with high light intensity we have high

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.910 
with high light intensity we have high
rates<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.900> photosynthesis<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.470> water

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
rates of photosynthesis and water

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.050 
rates of photosynthesis and water
movement<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.120> high<00:03:24.550> light<00:03:26.860> intensity<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.580> low

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060

humidity high wind high temperatures and
high<00:03:34.160> light<00:03:34.460> intensity<00:03:35.060> will<00:03:35.600> all<00:03:35.840> lead<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.560> a

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
high light intensity will all lead to a

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.640 
high light intensity will all lead to a
large<00:03:37.190> difference<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.840> concentration

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
large difference in the concentration

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.090 
large difference in the concentration
gradient<00:03:40.160> between<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.910> B<00:03:41.860> which<00:03:42.860> will

the<00:04:20.370> metal<00:04:20.640> poor<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.060> difference<00:04:21.630> would<00:04:21.930> be

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
small if the wind speed is low the water

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.110 
small if the wind speed is low the water
vapor<00:04:27.360> builds<00:04:27.930> up<00:04:28.080> around<00:04:28.260> here<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.220> the

vapor builds up around here and the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.660 
vapor builds up around here and the
gradient<00:04:30.390> is<00:04:30.780> shallow<00:04:31.140> is<00:04:31.440> small<00:04:31.860> again<00:04:32.220> so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
gradient is shallow is small again so

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.720 
gradient is shallow is small again so
that<00:04:32.850> would<00:04:33.000> be<00:04:33.030> low<00:04:33.590> rates<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.830> transpiration

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
that would be low rates of transpiration

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.220 
that would be low rates of transpiration
and<00:04:39.380> 3/4<00:04:40.380> temperatures<00:04:41.270> will<00:04:42.270> read<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.870> low

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
and 3/4 temperatures will read to low

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.590 
and 3/4 temperatures will read to low
rates<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.740> evaporation<00:04:46.370> here<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.450> would

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
rates of evaporation here so that would

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.810 
rates of evaporation here so that would
result<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.350> small<00:04:49.680> difference<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.550> slow

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
result in a small difference and a slow

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.650 
result in a small difference and a slow
rate<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:52.440> finally<00:04:53.100> with<00:04:53.670> low<00:04:53.910> light<00:04:54.210> intense

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
rate and finally with low light intense

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.940 
rate and finally with low light intense
thing<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:57.270> rate<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.570> photosynthesis<00:04:58.350> will<00:04:58.830> be

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
thing the rate of photosynthesis will be

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.610 
thing the rate of photosynthesis will be
slow<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.520> low<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.600> water<00:05:00.870> movement<00:05:01.380> would<00:05:01.440> be

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
slow and low so water movement would be

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.010 
slow and low so water movement would be
low<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.040> slow<00:05:02.600> so<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.810> key<00:05:04.200> features<00:05:04.860> of

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
low and slow so the key features of

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.780 
low and slow so the key features of
understanding<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.860> rate<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.250> transpiration

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
understanding the rate of transpiration

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.200 
understanding the rate of transpiration
is<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.630> difference<00:05:10.290> between<00:05:11.210> the

transpiration<00:05:22.320> depends<00:05:23.070> upon<00:05:23.240> creating
