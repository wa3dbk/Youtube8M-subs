I just kind of leave it hard and set us

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
I just kind of leave it hard and set us
off<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.150> some<00:01:36.270> reason<00:01:36.600> i<00:01:36.750> try<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.950> experiment

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
off for some reason i try to experiment

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.340 
off for some reason i try to experiment
with<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.549> interesting<00:01:39.390> colors<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.110> using

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
with some interesting colors like using

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.700 
with some interesting colors like using
some<00:01:40.680> greens<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> blues<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:42.060> her<00:01:42.150> skin

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
some greens and blues into her skin

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.080 
some greens and blues into her skin
trying<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> stylistic<00:01:44.909> look

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
trying to get more of a stylistic look

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
trying to get more of a stylistic look
rather<00:01:45.299> than<00:01:45.540> such<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> realistic<00:01:46.380> look<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.829> i

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
rather than such a realistic look and i

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060 
rather than such a realistic look and i
think<00:01:47.399> came<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.759> pretty<00:01:47.850> cool<00:01:48.860> one<00:01:49.860> thing<00:01:49.979> i'm

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
think came out pretty cool one thing i'm

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.179 
think came out pretty cool one thing i'm
focusing<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.759> formed<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> painted<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
focusing on is formed so I painted the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
focusing on is formed so I painted the
whole<00:01:53.310> thing<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.759> focusing<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.270> form<00:01:54.630> I'm

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
whole thing just focusing on form I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.109 
whole thing just focusing on form I'm
not<00:01:54.930> focusing<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.439> details<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.909> just

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
not focusing on details at all I'm just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
not focusing on details at all I'm just
purely<00:01:57.450> focusing<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.960> form<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> fact<00:01:58.560> that's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
purely focusing on form of fact that's

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.800 
purely focusing on form of fact that's
all<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> focus<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> entire<00:02:00.299> painting

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
all I focus on for the entire painting

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
all I focus on for the entire painting
is<00:02:00.960> form<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.040> ever<00:02:02.189> zoom

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
is form I don't think I don't ever zoom

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
is form I don't think I don't ever zoom
in<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.360> has<00:02:03.600> even<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.930> time<00:02:04.049> on

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
in well I actually has even one time on

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.539 
in well I actually has even one time on
the<00:02:04.229> face<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> be

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the face is because is going to be

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.310 
the face is because is going to be
trouble<00:02:05.729> from<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.090> far<00:02:06.299> away<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> had

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
trouble from that far away and so I had

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
trouble from that far away and so I had
to<00:02:07.350> zoom<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to zoom in just a little bit to get the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.300 
to zoom in just a little bit to get the
face<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.599> more<00:02:09.899> detailed<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
face a little bit more detailed but the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.500 
face a little bit more detailed but the
whole<00:02:11.459> thing<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.420> focusing<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.020> formula

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
whole thing is just focusing on formula

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.940 
whole thing is just focusing on formula

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
that's that's why I focus on the entire

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.009 
that's that's why I focus on the entire
time<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:37.090> noticed<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> couple<00:02:37.569> things<00:02:37.900> I

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
time and I noticed a couple things I

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.339 
time and I noticed a couple things I
didn't<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.680> was<00:02:38.799> painting<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:40.349> this

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
didn't like as I was painting it is this

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.020 
didn't like as I was painting it is this
is<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> downfall<00:02:42.129> of<00:02:42.159> starting<00:02:42.760> with<00:02:42.879> like<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
is the downfall of starting with like a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.490 
is the downfall of starting with like a
painting<00:02:43.420> rather<00:02:43.659> than<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.260> sketch

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
painting rather than more of a sketch

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.410 
painting rather than more of a sketch
but<00:02:44.769> uh<00:02:44.829> I<00:02:45.189> noticed<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.030> didn't<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.299> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
but uh I noticed I didn't like the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.199 
but uh I noticed I didn't like the
breast<00:02:46.659> so<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.840> had<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.109> move<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.799> breast<00:02:48.040> down<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
breast so I had to move a breast down to

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.270 
breast so I had to move a breast down to
make<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.359> look<00:02:49.569> better<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.920> another<00:02:51.069> thing<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
make it look better but another thing I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190 
make it look better but another thing I
wanted<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.519> do<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:51.909> after<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.480> was<00:02:52.750> looking<00:02:53.109> at

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
wanted to do is after I was looking at

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.509 
wanted to do is after I was looking at
it<00:02:53.230> for<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.440> while<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:53.829> okay<00:02:54.159> I<00:02:54.190> kind<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.430> went

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
it for a while like okay I kind of went

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.430 
it for a while like okay I kind of went
to<00:02:54.609> bender<00:02:55.000> waste<00:02:55.480> more<00:02:55.750> like<00:02:55.989> kind<00:02:56.139> of<00:02:56.230> put

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
to bender waste more like kind of put

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.670 
to bender waste more like kind of put
more<00:02:56.709> pressure<00:02:57.549> there<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.079> think<00:02:59.379> her<00:02:59.500> ways

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
more pressure there so I think her ways

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.170 
more pressure there so I think her ways
to<00:02:59.829> kind<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.129> bend<00:03:00.310> down<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.489> little<00:03:00.970> bit

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
to kind of bend down a little bit

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.300 
to kind of bend down a little bit
further<00:03:01.440> by<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.500> clip<00:03:02.799> because<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.190> way

she's holding herself up he just put
more<00:03:05.680> gravity<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.310> just<00:03:06.430> kind<00:03:06.639> of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
more gravity there and just kind of

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.430 
more gravity there and just kind of
pushed<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.389> another<00:03:07.900> thing<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.200> i<00:03:08.260> think

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
pushed that but another thing is i think

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.949 
pushed that but another thing is i think
her<00:03:08.859> back<00:03:09.129> arm<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.579> back<00:03:10.000> too<00:03:10.239> far<00:03:10.269> like<00:03:10.780> she's

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
her back arm is back too far like she's

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.449 
her back arm is back too far like she's
trying<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.889> looks<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.159> she's<00:03:12.310> just

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
trying to it looks like she's just

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.920 
trying to it looks like she's just
pushing<00:03:12.609> it<00:03:12.790> back<00:03:12.879> to<00:03:13.030> fart<00:03:13.269> should<00:03:13.450> be<00:03:13.569> closer

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
pushing it back to fart should be closer

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.140 
pushing it back to fart should be closer
to<00:03:14.319> her<00:03:14.709> midsection<00:03:14.920> i<00:03:15.340> think<00:03:15.579> coming<00:03:15.909> more

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
to her midsection i think coming more

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.949 
to her midsection i think coming more
straight<00:03:16.450> down<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:18.160> yeah<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:18.639> then<00:03:19.480> if<00:03:19.660> i<00:03:19.780> did

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
straight down but yeah so then if i did

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.050 
straight down but yeah so then if i did
that<00:03:19.989> though<00:03:20.319> then<00:03:20.530> i'd<00:03:20.680> have<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.889> put<00:03:21.819> her<00:03:21.879> arm

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
that though then i'd have to put her arm

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.460 
that though then i'd have to put her arm
further<00:03:22.389> away<00:03:22.569> then<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.900> only<00:03:23.019> see<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.349> her

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
further away then you only see like her

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.780 
further away then you only see like her
hand<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.919> that<00:03:24.040> looked<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.459> weird<00:03:24.639> so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
hand and that looked kind of weird so

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.659 
hand and that looked kind of weird so
anyway<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.949> don't<00:03:26.949> think<00:03:27.069> her<00:03:27.129> arm<00:03:27.310> was<00:03:27.430> quite

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
anyway I don't think her arm was quite

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.309 
anyway I don't think her arm was quite
natural<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.389> that<00:03:28.480> position<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.199> it's

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
natural not in that position that it's

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.930 
natural not in that position that it's
in<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.680> could<00:03:30.129> just<00:03:30.280> mean<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.519> disappear<00:03:30.819> all

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
in I could just mean to disappear all

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.640 
in I could just mean to disappear all
together<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.109> just<00:03:32.139> be<00:03:32.379> hidden

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
together and you know it just be hidden

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.580

out which will be form and dynamic
lighting<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.630> perspective<00:04:59.140> because<00:04:59.710> that's

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
lighting and perspective because that's

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.010

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
form that if the form is there it will

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.300 
form that if the form is there it will
actually<00:05:31.420> look<00:05:31.720> like<00:05:31.780> something<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:32.590> it's

just<00:05:33.490> amazing<00:05:33.730> how<00:05:33.940> about<00:05:34.210> performance

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
just amazing how about performance

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.930 
just amazing how about performance
without<00:05:34.900> any<00:05:35.230> detail<00:05:35.650> form<00:05:36.430> handles<00:05:36.850> most

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
without any detail form handles most

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.880 
without any detail form handles most
everything<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:37.780> if<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.020> forms<00:05:38.380> right<00:05:38.590> which

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
everything so if the forms right which

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.490 
everything so if the forms right which
means<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.640> foundations<00:05:40.330> right<00:05:40.540> then<00:05:41.260> when

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
means the foundations right then when

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.140 
means the foundations right then when
you<00:05:41.560> add<00:05:41.710> all<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:42.130> details<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.610> want<00:05:42.760> on<00:05:42.970> to

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
you add all the details you want on to

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.640 
you add all the details you want on to
it<00:05:43.300> it's<00:05:43.840> all<00:05:44.050> going<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.260> look<00:05:44.380> correct

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
it it's all going to look correct

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.150 
it it's all going to look correct
because<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.220> form<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.730> correct<00:05:46.710> if<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.890> form

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
because the form is correct if the form

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.500 
because the form is correct if the form
is<00:05:48.220> not<00:05:48.310> correct<00:05:48.640> though<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:49.090> can<00:05:49.240> add<00:05:49.330> all

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
is not correct though you can add all

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.080 
is not correct though you can add all
the<00:05:49.660> cool<00:05:50.160> texturing<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.280> awesome<00:05:51.730> details

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
the cool texturing and awesome details

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.820 
the cool texturing and awesome details
as<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.300> want<00:05:52.510> and<00:05:52.750> people<00:05:53.320> are<00:05:53.500> just<00:05:53.530> going<00:05:53.770> to
