full<00:00:12.180> of<00:00:12.270> risks<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.750> fut<00:00:13.350> and<00:00:14.270> fu<00:00:15.270> well<00:00:15.809> let's

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
full of risks of fut and fu well let's

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.850 
full of risks of fut and fu well let's
start<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.350> fut<00:00:17.810> most<00:00:18.810> fut<00:00:19.410> doctors<00:00:19.920> say

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
start with fut most fut doctors say

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.030 
start with fut most fut doctors say
after<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:22.980> procedure<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.730> will<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:25.470> very

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
after the procedure we will have a very

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.060 
after the procedure we will have a very
tiny<00:00:26.540> linear<00:00:27.540> scar<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.890> your

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
tiny linear scar on the back of your

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.250 
tiny linear scar on the back of your
head<00:00:29.369> well<00:00:30.320> we<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.590> mostly<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:33.030> large<00:00:33.570> scars

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
head well we see mostly very large scars

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.200 
head well we see mostly very large scars
of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.650> fut<00:00:35.150> with<00:00:36.150> large<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.660> mean<00:00:36.870> 5<00:00:37.649> 6<00:00:38.210> 7

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
of the fut with large I mean 5 6 7

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.560 
of the fut with large I mean 5 6 7
millimeters<00:00:39.600> large<00:00:40.850> then<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
millimeters large then we have to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.639 
millimeters large then we have to
correct<00:00:43.200> them<00:00:43.620> fill<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.039> lot<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.519> grafts<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
correct them fill a lot with grafts and

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
correct them fill a lot with grafts and
recently<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.920> had<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.370> patient<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.269> be<00:00:48.390> able

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
recently we had one patient to be able

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.889 
recently we had one patient to be able
to<00:00:48.690> put<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:50.010> than<00:00:50.160> 800<00:00:50.789> grafts<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.390> his<00:00:51.539> scar

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to put more than 800 grafts in his scar

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.639 
to put more than 800 grafts in his scar
and<00:00:52.429> that's<00:00:53.429> that's<00:00:53.789> really<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.989> waste<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and that's that's really a waste of of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
and that's that's really a waste of of
grafts<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:57.109> what<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> other<00:00:58.440> risk

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
grafts I think what are the other risk

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.470 
grafts I think what are the other risk
for<00:00:59.280> fut<00:01:00.589> fut<00:01:01.589> it's<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.269> real

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
for fut fut it's more like in a real

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.890 
for fut fut it's more like in a real
operation<00:01:04.670> there<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:06.120> can<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.690> lot<00:01:06.870> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
operation there is there can be a lot of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.440 
operation there is there can be a lot of
blood<00:01:07.290> loss<00:01:08.750> tension<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> skin<00:01:11.450> permanent

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
blood loss tension on the skin permanent

headaches traction of the scar the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.540 
headaches traction of the scar the
cutting<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> nerves<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.770> give<00:01:16.980> permanent

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
cutting of the nerves can give permanent

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.160 
cutting of the nerves can give permanent
pens<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.460> sensitivity<00:01:21.170> disorders

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pens you can have sensitivity disorders

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.250 
pens you can have sensitivity disorders
after<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> death<00:01:23.070> operation<00:01:23.730> and<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.870> most<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
after the death operation and in most of

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.160 
after the death operation and in most of
the<00:01:25.440> cases<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.010> permanent

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the cases it's permanent

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.600 
the cases it's permanent
what<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.320> risks<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> fue<00:01:30.980> well<00:01:31.980> after<00:01:32.310> we

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
what are the risks of fue well after we

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
what are the risks of fue well after we
the<00:01:33.410> risk<00:01:34.410> is<00:01:35.180> mostly<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> harvesting

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the risk is mostly in the harvesting

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.390 
the risk is mostly in the harvesting
stage<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:39.210> means<00:01:39.770> they<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.950> build<00:01:41.190> things

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
stage that means they can build things

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.600 
stage that means they can build things
from<00:01:41.640> while<00:01:42.330> harvesting<00:01:42.720> grafts<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:44.430> it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
from while harvesting grafts when it's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.690 
from while harvesting grafts when it's
done<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:45.030> an<00:01:45.330> experienced<00:01:46.020> hands<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:47.520> means

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
done by an experienced hands that means

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.520 
done by an experienced hands that means
there<00:01:48.510> can<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:49.430> transactional

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
there can be transactional

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.870 
there can be transactional
the<00:01:50.590> graphs<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:52.600> can<00:01:52.810> be<00:01:53.040> claping<00:01:54.040> that

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the graphs there can be claping that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.440 
the graphs there can be claping that
means<00:01:55.119> that<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.350> top<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> grafts<00:01:57.450> break

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
means that the top of the grafts break

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.840 
means that the top of the grafts break
off<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:59.020> then<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.680> have<00:01:59.860> no<00:02:00.040> world<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:03.580> can

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
off and then you have no world you can

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.320 
off and then you have no world you can
have<00:02:03.880> problems<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.799> extract<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.940> entire

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
have problems to extract the entire

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.690 
have problems to extract the entire
follicular<00:02:08.020> units<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:09.369> can<00:02:09.959> damage<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
follicular units you can damage the the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.059 
follicular units you can damage the the
protective<00:02:13.239> sheet<00:02:13.630> around<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.650> follicular

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
protective sheet around the follicular

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.770 
protective sheet around the follicular
unit<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.700> all<00:02:16.510> those<00:02:17.190> problems<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.880> give<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
unit and all those problems can give a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.259 
unit and all those problems can give a
low-density<00:02:21.180> worse<00:02:22.180> growth<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.800> result

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
low-density worse growth and that result

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.810 
low-density worse growth and that result
so<00:02:25.269> what's<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.630> solution<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.820> solution

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
so what's the solution to that solution

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.900 
so what's the solution to that solution
that<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.930> go<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.500> fue<00:02:30.040> if<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.730> do

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
that is that if you go for fue if you do

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.479 
that is that if you go for fue if you do
not<00:02:31.060> want<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.720> scar<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.800> back<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.100> your<00:02:33.250> head

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
not want a scar on the back of your head

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.880 
not want a scar on the back of your head
you<00:02:34.360> choose<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.959> very<00:02:35.380> experienced<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.459> doctor
