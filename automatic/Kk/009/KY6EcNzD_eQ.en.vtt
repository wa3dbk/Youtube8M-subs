00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.680
 as has already been said and others of this channel in the 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.299
 strong competitive team in its format 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.550
 six verses 6 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.110
 the team consists of two billboards 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.599
 but these two dreams have a function 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.490
 different and in this video I explain to 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.320
 you the differences between one and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.460
 your in-game features 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.070
 good first crisis has a 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.500
 a somewhat different denomination of a sound of 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.770
 It is called pocket health care and other 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.349
 soldier or the man or homer of the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.730
 way you want to call it now. 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.559
 tell you 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.539
 differences and characteristics 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.050
 of each type of player 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:41.079
 to see if you fit the profile of the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.820
 class only the harakat the soldier group 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.219
 pocket should as main objective 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.649
 do everything to get a doctor and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.989
 I live telling that normally the two 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.329
 walk along a player feature 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.820
 pocket is that it has a good 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.429
 look good intuition and a good reflection 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.989
 to take action quickly in the 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.819
 majority of players who play with 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.039
 pocket are quoted 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.170
 the leaders of the team and decide which course 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.630
 take to reach the goal 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 usually the pocket will always be on the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.280
 the front line of the advances that the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.340
 will take to be able to move on 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.259
 with goals and how the pocket sound 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.180
 always walk with the doctor he usually 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.320
 always will benefit from the udders 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.509
 physician's 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.579
 so it's more or less always like this 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.509
 It is a specific case that someone 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.539
 feel more than I am today homer 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.969
 the dream of homer or man is a 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.280
 feature of the home player is 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.590
 to master the rock of anp well for your 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.320
 own benefit and this use of the form 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.180
 that is so much and dodging something or 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.280
 also advance to perform an attack 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.090
 two fundamental items that man 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.960
 usually uses is the gamble's that decreases 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.200
 The damage is a blast from the rock of before and the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.869
 equalizer that the lower your 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 user and then moves faster 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.920
 an emergency time you're alive 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.899
 you use this weapon to measure and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.700
 you drove fast if you dodged 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.690
 from the danger area this is the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.400
 important 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.010
 a very interesting tip because it was 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.379
 a dream of pomegranate 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.659
 always away from the doctor is interesting 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.599
 that the player who is playing with him 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.329
 I know all the pots of life on the map. 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.030
 so he can live a little longer and 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.370
 also be aware of the map proposing and not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.140
 possible vacuum to know where to find 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.220
 a life to stay depending on the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.290
 doctors understand then this is phibex 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.970
 suggestions are well accepted and I hope 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.290
 Did you like this video?
