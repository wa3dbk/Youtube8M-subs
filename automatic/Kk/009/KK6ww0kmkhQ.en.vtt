a<00:00:09.630> few<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:10.200> both<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.880> needed<00:00:12.120> someplace

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
a few of both and so I needed someplace

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.160 
a few of both and so I needed someplace
to<00:00:13.099> put<00:00:14.099> them<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.780> don't<00:00:15.929> get

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to put them to so that they don't get

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.840 
to put them to so that they don't get
all<00:00:16.289> tangled<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.480> messed<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.730> let<00:00:20.730> me

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
all tangled up and messed up so let me

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.519 
all tangled up and messed up so let me
show<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> use<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> organize<00:00:22.289> them

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
show you what I use to organize them

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.169 
show you what I use to organize them
that's<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:26.180> idea<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.890> organizing<00:00:28.970> necklaces

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that's my idea of organizing necklaces

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.590 
that's my idea of organizing necklaces
that's<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.170> bulletin<00:00:31.500> board<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.600> they

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that's a bulletin board you see and they

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.709 
that's a bulletin board you see and they
are<00:00:33.840> hooked<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:35.180> those<00:00:36.180> push<00:00:36.480> pins<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> that's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
are hooked on those push pins so that's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
are hooked on those push pins so that's
how<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.960> organized<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:40.590> necklaces<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.250> think

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
how I organized my necklaces I think

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
how I organized my necklaces I think
it's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:42.390> neat<00:00:42.510> idea<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.739> keeps

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it's a pretty neat idea because it keeps

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670 
it's a pretty neat idea because it keeps
them<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.700> instead<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> being<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.410> over

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
them up and instead of it being all over

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520 
them up and instead of it being all over
the<00:00:46.829> place<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.629> tangling<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.050> one

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the place and tangling up with one

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.700 
the place and tangling up with one
another<00:00:49.700> it's<00:00:50.700> hanging<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.510> their<00:00:51.750> loose<00:00:52.020> end

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
another it's hanging up their loose end

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
another it's hanging up their loose end
it's<00:00:53.340> neat<00:00:53.760> organized<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.750> yeah<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.760> like

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it's neat organized and yeah so I like

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.889 
it's neat organized and yeah so I like
it<00:00:58.460> all<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> Walmart

it all you need to do is go to Walmart

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.420 
it all you need to do is go to Walmart
and<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> bulletin<00:01:01.530> board<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.160> get

and get a bulletin board and then get

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.090 
and get a bulletin board and then get
some<00:01:02.699> push<00:01:03.420> pins<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.589> line<00:01:04.890> them<00:01:05.010> up

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
some push pins and then line them up

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.600 
some push pins and then line them up
like<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.920> then<00:01:07.920> eyeing<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.280> necklace

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
like that and then eyeing your necklace

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
like that and then eyeing your necklace
up<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.210> you're<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.310> then

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
up and you're good to go and then

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.780 
up and you're good to go and then
there's<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.380> because<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> needed<00:01:13.770> more<00:01:14.520> room

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
there's the because I needed more room

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
there's the because I needed more room
because<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> already

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
because as you could see this already

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.969 
because as you could see this already
looks<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.820> tough<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.020> need

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
looks like it's tough there but I need

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
looks like it's tough there but I need
more<00:01:20.189> room<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> hanger<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.200> but

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
more room and there's a hanger there but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
more room and there's a hanger there but
they<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.340> thing<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
they think the thing is if it was a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.140 
they think the thing is if it was a
coincidence<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.880> had

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
coincidence for that because I just had

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.859 
coincidence for that because I just had
that<00:01:27.420> four<00:01:27.840> coats<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.710> didn't<00:01:29.280> use<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:29.869> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that four coats and I didn't use them so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.620 
that four coats and I didn't use them so
I<00:01:31.250> decided<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.610> why<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:32.970> use<00:01:33.270> different

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I decided you know why not use different

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.280 
I decided you know why not use different
necklaces<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> organized<00:01:37.140> my

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
necklaces so that's how I organized my

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
necklaces so that's how I organized my

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that each shelf I got it I found it in

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380 
that each shelf I got it I found it in
the<00:01:51.000> garage<00:01:51.210> lane<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.000> old

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the garage lane it was from my old

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.789 
the garage lane it was from my old
computer<00:01:55.320> table<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:57.990> holes<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
computer table and it has holes so I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.149 
computer table and it has holes so I
thought<00:01:59.130> hey<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> can<00:02:00.180> put<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.320> earrings<00:02:01.740> in

was cut holes in between here like that

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.930 
was cut holes in between here like that
and<00:03:18.449> then<00:03:19.280> stick<00:03:20.280> your<00:03:21.769> rings<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.040> there<00:03:23.400> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
pretty and really nifty idea actually if

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.319 
pretty and really nifty idea actually if
I<00:03:33.690> say<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.139> myself<00:03:34.260> because<00:03:35.040> then<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:36.060> way<00:03:36.209> it

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
I say so myself because then that way it

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.629 
I say so myself because then that way it
doesn't<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:37.470> lost<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.949> scatter<00:03:38.220> all<00:03:38.370> over
